"This is an original piece of horror fiction using a tried and true premise outsider goes to a small town uncovers secrets and weird things going on a race against the ticking clock etc.Muriel gray does a great indepth job about this trucker who is carrying an unknown cargo and just writes a great novel . She is a new writer and is one to watch she has all the tools to scare and frighten.She writes at a breakneck speed and keeps the obstacles coming . The twists and turns are realistic and she does a credible job at shaping her characters.Definitely a writer to watch ! ! ",3
"Did not care for this book . I do n't know if I would classify it as more weird or just stupid . The concept of alchemists and the curse associated with passing of dried human skin was pretty crazy . I like a good horror book but this was just not my cup of tea . ",1
"Some of the other reviewers here and the liner notes of the book itself suggest Gray is on par with King . Well if you have n't read a lot of King you might think so but Gray lacks the one thing that Kings excels at building a sense of menace fear and genuine creepiness . Much of this book alludes to this great big otherworldy evil yet the payoff is disappointing . The basic idea is good the passing of the runes to the victim who becomes the conduit forwell I wo n't give it away but believe me it 's not really all that scary if this book kept you from sleeping you must scare quite easily . I agree with some of the other reviewers that the world of truckers seems an odd choice for a setting . Also Gray 's British vocabulary can be a bit distracting for the American reader not that the book should be written to suit American tastes but every time I read colour or odour it stops the narrative in its tracks but spelling differences are n't as problematic as is the choice of terminology that no American particularly a trucker would use . There is a reference to a saloon car which is British for sedan but over here sounds like something out of a weird western . Same goes for Perspex which we Yanks know as Plexiglass . The plot twists are n't too believable either particularly one character 's complete mental turnabout after the character 's true agenda is revealed . In fact character development is lacking in general for example why is the elderly Asian man even in there ? And not to nitpick but it really does say Five Days Alive Permitted on the cover but the narrative in more places than one refers to Three Days Alive Permitted a careless publishing error . To summarize a good idea but poorly executed . ",2
"I loved this book at the start . The story was so engaging and ominous . The baby being run over at the start and the evil evil evil looking bird following Josh everywhere had me hooked . The characterization was ace too and I felt for Josh a great deal in many of his dire circumstances.But then the plot just got bogged down in hokey black magic mumbo jumbo . It lost control and just went crazy . Perhaps I did n't read it right or had other expectation but I think that it all could have been told in a better and less stupidly from that point on . Too bad considering such a strong opening . ",1
"Furnace is an enjoyable read for those who are into the less gory and more creepy type of horror fiction . While not quite achieving Stephen Kingesque complete lack of style Gray does use very straightforward storytelling which is so effective in horror novels . The story is generally engaging despite being utterly predictable . Predictability in itself is not a bad thing it 's what puts the suspense in an Hitchcock film but it loses its luster when you are not supposed to have figured it out.On a couple of occasions Gray is a tad too aware of the fact that she is writing a horror novel and embarrassing phrases like It was Hell calling sneak in . Characters are nearly three dimensional but mostly boil down to walking stereotypes . The reader does get a sense of the main character Josh Spiller having some depth to him however he is about the only one who does and it 's not particularly wellexplored.Nevertheless I did find Furnace to be an pageturner and would recommend it to others with the above caveats in mind . ",3
"A truck driver passing through a small town is passed along an item that will summon a demon to kill him in a few days and as time winds down he desparately tries to find a way to avoid this fate.Muriel Grey takes her time establishing her main character Josh but when the story kicks into a nightmarish race against time it 's scary fun.Racing along highways trying to find a solution this has the riveting intensity that 's been missing from Dean Koontz and Stephen King books in years.Keeping the mumbo jumbo to a minimum and the tension high with a likable main character this is one of the best horror novels of recent years . ",3
"After I read this book I checked to make sure I was n't carrying any odd looking pieces of paper ! I loved how Gray described the creatures various manifestations never overboard just enough to let YOUR imagination run wild like on moonless nights when you hear a muffled thump outside your window.The bait and switch tactics employed by Josh Spiller fooled me as well as Griffin and the mayor YOU ASKED FOR IT describes my reaction upon witnessing the results . ",3
"I 've never done serious overtheroad trucking but I 've driven hundreds of thousands of miles around the U.S. fairly often pulling the kind of marathons that Josh Spiller and his trucker buddies do . The American road is a world of its own and I 've read few books that capture it . Muriel Gray really nails it which is surprising given that she 's from Scotland . She mentions in the acknowledgements that she took a crosscountry trip with a trucker as part of her research . She was obviously paying attention.As for the rest the characters are believable the plot moves right along and it 's nice to read a good novel about America where the characters are working class . This is popular fiction not serious literature but it 's a darn good read . ",3
"I was so happy to stumble on Muriel Gray 's TRICKSTER . She does n't pull any punches when writing horror . After that I did n't hesitate to pick up FURNACE and I certainly was n't disappointed.Josh Spiller love that name is a trucker . With domestic problems on his mind he pulls off in Furnace VA for a bite to eat and falls right into the middle of a supernatural power struggle involving child sacrifice and ancient evil . What he does n't know at first is that the entire quaint little town is part of the evil secret of Furnace and that he has been picked to carry out demonic purpose . Josh just wants to get home but no matter how far he drives he ca n't escape that little town . Gray creates a wonderfully horrifying tale the events take on nightmare qualities as Josh struggles desperately to save his soul and to keep the evil from his family.This is certainly a good read . It could have benefitted from better editingthere were times I had to check to make sure the setting was actually in America . But overall I enjoyed this one a great deal and ca n't wait for Gray 's next one to hit the stands . ",3
"Furnace is one of my favorte reads . Ms. Gray captures a great hero in this book . You understand him and what makes him tick . She also captures the area that this book takes place in very well . Even though she does n't name real places or people I knew where she was because I grew up in that area off of Interstate 81 . Ms. Gray did a wonderful job of making her people and places come alive . She has a great understanding of the back area of rural Virginia . The plot was good . Reminded me of the old movie Curse of the Demon but taken further in plot . She surprised me several times . Her subplotting kept me on the edge of my seat too . Very good read . ",4
"This book is fast paced full of suspense horror and nice twists . This is a definite mustread for any horror fan . I never heard of this author before I read this book but I would like to see more from her.One thing another reviewer commented on the socalled spelling errors . Muriel Gray is from Scotland and she uses the English spellings of words . These are NOT spelling errors ! ",4
"Nothing jerks me out of a story faster than a misspelled word . Foul for fowl and jewellery for jewelry ? Come on folks ! Are there no proofreaders left alive ? That said Furnace is a good read . Nice tension believable characters . She did her trucking research and I do n't understand other reviewers ' problems with the dialogue.I 'll read her next book and would recommend this one . ",2
"I had never heard of Muriel Gray until I saw the sleek mass market paperback cover of Furnace shouting out at me from the shelves of a local bookstore . The back seemed intriguing enough to buy and put in my WinterRead pile . Well I just finished this book I started yesterday and let me just say WOW ! Paced to beat lightning this book did n't let up until the end ! Josh Spiller is a long distance truck driver who happens to take a wrong turn into a very sinister Virginia town . A town by the name of Furnace . While attempting to find his way out of the town a strange looking woman pushes a baby filled stroller under Josh 's big rig . When Josh stops dumbfounded and horrified by what has just happened the woman is nowhere to be seen unfortunately the remains of the baby are . Josh is quickly absolved form any wrongdoing and shaken he 's back on the road . But this time it 's the road to Hell.This story has all the elements of a classic Horror tale . The small town that keeps sinister secrets . Monsters both human and some worse . Dark rituals . Rich characterization . Action packed sequences that terrify and make you continue to read with whiteknuckled tension . Do n't start reading this at night if you have to work in the morning you might miss out on some sleep ! Muriel Gray earned herself a fan with this one . Note the author is apparently from Scotland and you might note some British spellings of words but do n't worry Mrs. Gray 's knowledge of America never comes into question . I sincerely hope the front cover of the book is n't lying and that we can expect Furnace to be coming to movie screens soon . Definitely cinematic . I 'm also looking forward to reading Muriel Gray 's first Horror novel Trickster.A great fun read for Horror fans and Action fans alike . Three Days Alive Permitted . ",4
"This is a great horror novel from beginning to end . A truck driver unknown to him gets marked and will be killed by a demon in three days unless he can find a way to reverse the curse placed upon him . Absolutely scary especially the ending when the demon faces the main character . What a great talent from Muriel Gray . ",4
"Ho hum ho hum after the absolute power house that was The Sandman I find myself assured in my beliefs that no one but Neil himself should ever write for the series . Over all this was a very bland collection of stories hat at times had very little to do with any of The Endless that ranged from mediocre to down right painful for the most of the book . However there were a few good pieces in here that definitely made it worth while to drudge through the lesser parts.Masquerade & High Water Ai n't You Most Done Yet and the Witch 's Heart were all middle ground for me being entertaining but not particularly outstanding . The true stars for this collection for me were Each Damp Thing Splatter Valosay and Elet and Stopp't Clock Yard . The only story I found absolutely 100 % appalling beyond belief in it 's insipid story telling was The Birth Day which was so bad that I almost put down the book and decided to stop reading if it had n't been for the fact that blissfully I decided to read one more story and came across Will Shetterly 's absolutely brutal if at times a bit obvious Splatter.Over all this is n't the worst way to spend an evening but it 's by no mean 's Gaiman 's Sandman and anyone looking for the brilliant story telling we got in canon will be advised to look elsewhere .

"I have n't experienced the total Sandman world so am commenting from the 'some but not all perspective ' which many potential readers may have . First is the short story structure itself the beauty of the changing voices & visions pays the price of admission alone even if you 've only the barest knowledge of the Sandman oeuvre . This collection is like the gates to faery within and between these short & beautifully tantalizing bits of prose you may glimpse Something just beyond . Sometimes you see it sometimes for the noninitiate ? it passes you by but for me it was an altogether enjoyable experience . That Gaiman chose & introduces each piece is a small sweetness before each storycourse.The Preface by Frank McConnell is a lovely and literate tale itself though I doubt the author would consider it so nevertheless it is a true telling of who we are and an excellently well written introduction to the Sandman world . It is exactly enough to know what to expect from these gifted authors whose words fill in and leave out what 's needed.I bought this because I 've been enchanted by the works of Barbara Hambly for decades and wanted to read her story Each Damp Thing she spins an exquisitely crafted tale of Dreaming herein . If you 're a reader of Hambly 's or any author in the book you wo n't be disappointed by their story in this collection & 'your ' author 's tale will take you by the hand through the others . ",4

"Between 1988 and 1996 over the course of seventyfive Sandman comic books plus various specials and mini series Neil Gaiman told the complex moving story of Morpheus the Lord of the Dreaming and his family the Endless . Taken as a whole the series constitutes a tale about a single character Dream a.k.a . Morpheus and as Frank McConnell points out in his excellent introduction an intricate funny and profound tale about tales a story about why there are stories.Dream is the central figure of the story . Tall thin pale always dressed in black the image of his creator ? he is truly a flawed hero a godlike figure subject to the emotions and weaknesses of mankind . Able to create and destroy worlds on a whim he fails as father and husband . Seemingly invincible he can be brought down by the righteous anger of a distraught mother.For eight years Gaiman mined this rich vein only to stop at the height of the series ' popularity at a point in time when he felt the story he had in mind from the beginning had reached its natural conclusion . Gaiman 's creations live on however in DC 's new series The Dreaming and in this anthology written by several mainstream i.e . noncomic book writers.Given the brilliance of the original comic and with Gaiman coeditor Sandman aficionados and novices alike might approach this anthology with high hopes . Unfortunately they are likely to be somewhat disappointed . Perhaps the writers had to operate under severe restrictions perhaps they did n't feel comfortable working within someone else 's universeit 's hard to say . Although the stories are uniformly well crafted they fail to break any new ground or provide novel insights into the rich cast of familiar characters . This is not to say that the anthology is entirely a waste of timemany of the stories are excellent and all are readable . Still the writers might have done more with the material.Enough negativity . The best story in this collection is Susanna Clarke 's Stopp't Clock Yard a tale that could easily have been part of the World 's End story arc from the original series . Gaiman himself comments I wish I had written this story . Clarke tells the amusing tale of magician Isaac Trismegistus and rogue John Paramore a pair who invade Morpheus ' realm to bring the deceased back to their loved ones . Morpheus is rendered perfectly a distracted deity swift to anger but patient in the extreme . Dream waits out his tormentors only to have his revenge stolen away by one of his siblings.Other strong entries are Will Shetterly 's Splatter set at the infamous Serial Killers Convention seen in The Doll 's House George Alec Effinger 's Seven Nights in Slumberland a delightful tribute to both The Sandman and Little Nemo Barbara Hambly 's Each Damp Thing a scary funny piece featuring Cain and Abel and Brenda W. Clough 's The Birth Day wherein Dream visits a storyteller who may be too clever for her own good . Honorable mentions include Colin Greenland 's Masquerade and High Water Tad Williams ' The Writer 's Child Delia Sherman 's The Witch 's Heart Nancy Collins ' The Mender of Broken Dreams and Gene Wolfe 's Ai n't You Most Done ? .One need not be familiar with the series to enjoy this book but it helps . Most of the writers here seem content pursuing themes Gaiman has already visited rather than developing their own . It 's hard to recommend the hardcover to general audiences but the trade paperback is an elegant solutionfor twelve dollars most will be able to spend a few pleasurable hours with Dream and his kin . Rabid fans of the series may be disappointed but general readers should enjoy the time they spend in The Dreaming . ",3
"Neil Gaiman 's The Sandman has established itself as a classic of modern literature . But how do Morpheus the Endless and the various supporting characters fare when written by others ? The answer unsurprisingly appears to depend upon which author is doing the writing . It would be tedious for me to try to do the proper thing and review each story individually so I will dwell only upon a few which stand out particularly strongly in my mind.First of all I would say without reservation that the best story in the book is Stopp'tClock Yard by the magnificent Susanna Clarke who shows all of the whit and brilliance which she would later pour into her novel Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell . She once again manages to cement her place as one of my favourite living authors.Other strong entries include the at times tragic and beautiful Chain Home Low by John M. Ford the disturbing Splatter by Will Shetterly the grotesque Each Damp Thing by Barbara Hambly and Ai n't You Most Done by Gene Wolf . George Allec Effinger 's Seven Nights in Slumberland presents the irresistable idea of a crossover between The Sandman and Little Nemo in Slumberland but the characterization of the Endless seemed a bit off to me somehow so I was n't able to enjoy it as much as I might have done . An Extra Smidgeon of Eternity by Robert Rodi accomplished its aim nicely in that I too was annoyed in a good way by the main character 's abrupt death during a crucial part of Wanda 's story . The Mender of Broken Dreams by nancy A. Collins was also quite good although Morpheus seemed a touch out of character and though I do n't want to let my own biases interfere with my review I must say that as an autistic person myself I found the resolution to be extremely condescending.There were also a number of stories with interesting concepts but imperfect executions . I found Caitlin R. Kiernan 's Escape Artist to be interesting although I could probably stand to read it again as its disjointed nature confused me . That said Wanda was one of my favourite characters and any further development is more than welcome . A Bone Dry Place by Karen Haber was also intriguing but muddled . Of the twin stories The Writer 's Child by Tad Williams and The Gate of Gold by Mark Kreigbaum the former had by far the better execution though it needed to be fleshedout more . I am responsive to the idea of The Birthday but I do n't feel that the story was all that it should have been though I can not quite lay my finger as to why.Of the other stories I found most to be immemorable the only one I truly disliked was The Witch 's Heart by Delia Sherman as it seemed a dry plodding narrative populated by unsympathetic or underdeveloped characters.All told a fine book although it ca n't really compare to The Sandman written by Neil Gaiman himself .

"Sandman Neil Gaiman 's wonderful creation is the concept that this group of stories is based on . Like any story collection this one has its hits and misses.HitsChain Home Low What happened to those affected by Dream 's disappearance ? Each Damp Thing Barbara Hambly has a good grasp of Gaiman 's cast of characters . Set in The Dreaming this one would have made a good comic.Seven Nights in Slumberland Little Nemo ? Now Windsor McCay 's work makes more sense . I think.Both Wanda stories . A character that certainly warranted more examination than the comic allowed.Endless Sestina For the sheer nerve of it.The Gate of Gold The flip side of The Writer 's Child but much more fulfilling . There really are good dreams.A Bone Dry Place Dream and Delirium together again.The Mender of Broken Dreams The concept is not new but it is so well written you wo n't care.Valosag and Elet There are so few folktales being written anymore . At least good ones.Stopp'tClock Yard Captures the true essence of Gaiman 's creation . This is another one that Gaiman could have written.MissesDesire stories . This character is tedious as all stories end up being variations on the same theme . Especially The Witch 's Heart it goes on and on.The Birth Day A clever idea but not fully developed.Splatter A little obvious.The Writer 's Child Ditto.Ai n't You ` Most Done ? 32 pages long and I could n't remember what it was about by the time I finished the book . And it 's one of the last stories.Advertising Clive Barker 's participation . It 's a frontispiece and it 's Death not Dream.Taking an existing character whose popularity lies in a graphic medium and using him and his supporting cast as the basis of an anthology is a risky proposition . While this book is not entirely successful it 's definitely worth a read for the Sandman fan . ",2
"Neil Gaiman is an amazing writer and it is because of his stories about The Sandman that I became a comic book fan . If you can suspend belief and open your mind to the realm of imagination you can step into the world that Mr. Gaiman created revolving around the King of Dreams . The entire series of the Sandman will leave you riveted and wanting more . Take the time to explore the realm of dreams and you will not be disappointed ! ",4
"It is funny how one can initially misjudge a book . When I first picked this volume up it was because I saw Neil Gaiman and Clive Barker 's names on the cover . Then on first perusal I saw that Gaiman had not even written the introduction . Moreover Barker 's only contribution was the frontispiece a drawing of Death . Nor did I immediately recognize the names of any of the contributors to the collection . I felt cheated . I jumped to the conclusion that this was a hack written collection of short stories intended to exploit the popularity of the Sandman series . I threw the book down in disgust.Then a little over a year later I came back to it . Upon actually reading it I discovered that Gaiman handpicked these stories . Indeed he actually wrote the brief introductions for each writer and story . As for the stories themselves there are some hauntingly lovingly skillfully written tales here . What is more important most of them genuinely capture the atmosphere of the Dreaming from the graphic novels . I could not have been more wrong about this fine collection it was exactly what I was looking for.These stories are so faithful to the original that the reader might want to read the entire 10 volume Sandman Library before attempting it . There is much here that assumes a familiarity with the entire series . ",4
"An averagetogood collection of short Sandman stories . My two favorites Escape Artist by Caitlin Kiernan while not technically perfect is touching and memorable Ai n't You 'Most Done by Gene Wolfe represents the Dreaming as it 's really like no German Expressionist tilting dark walls and Hollywood special effects but real life gone just a little bit different . Very well done . ",3
"Most of my beefs with this have been aired here . This author was brilliant over the 1st four books what happened ? How could he go from that to books 5 and 6 ? Makes me thing he either has hired ghost writers or someone milli vanillied 14 . Anyone agree ? The difference is that stark . Wish he 'd go back to the mindset he was in back then . I quit . ",1
"Fantastic after a very long book 4 that set up so much this book explodes with action and compelling story linesCa n't wait for book 6 . ",4
"No one has been more adamant about the genius of George R.R . Martin than I have . Sadly I think he was a little off of his game on this one . Maybe part of the problem was waiting so very long for this book . I may have gotten too much anxiety and expectation built up over the years as I waited for this book to come . Maybe another problem was that it seems this book was a transitional or calmbeforethestorm type of book . The first three books in this series while having multiple characters and multiple storylines usually always had at least one important story that came to at least some sort of conclusion at the end of the book . This book was absent of any great climax . I THOUGHT there was one coming that events seemed to be leading up to for most of the book but that storyline abruptly dies and left me feeling cheated.Do n't get me wrong the book was great ! The characters are superb . I 've grown to love many of them over the last few books . As always Martin does a wonderful job of telling a story through the eyes of various characters each in a unique way . Rather than a 3rd person story that gives the readers facts and some insights into a broad range of characters we see the events unfold via a personal viewpoint of different people . I think it does a better job of drawing the reader in as you experience events through each person 's eyes and feel their emotions as the drama unfolds . Sometimes we get to experience a common event through two different characters ' eyes which is quite interesting . One complaint though is that the story is almost getting too big . The author keeps adding more characters and I 'm starting to reach my maximum amount of people that I care to keep track of . Also some of the names in parts of the story such as Hizdahr Zo Loraq Skahaz Mo Kandaq and Reznak Mo Reznak start to run together after awhile.As usual with a Martin book the world he creates is full of depth and detail . Every kingdom city family etc . has a unique feel . It 's so easy to become immersed in the story as if each place were a city that you visit all the time and every character is an old friend you 've known all your life.It 's surely a sign of good writing if my biggest problem is that I have grown to love the good guys so much and hate the bad guys so much that I 'm getting a little impatient waiting for justice to finally come . I find myself continually hoping with each event that THIS is where the tide finally starts to turn only to have my hopes crushed . If I look at the book as this setting in motion a string of events that will come to climax in the next book I can be much more forgiving . However if the storylines continue to veer off in everincreasing paths with no end in sight my patience is going to begin to wear thin . I have danced with the dragons long enough . It 's time for this song to end and let the final battle begin ! ",2
"This is not a typical fantasy story it 's a never ending series of welldescribed events involving perfectly profiled characters in a wonderful setting.It 's hard to grasp you usually forget half of what you read and to be honest it does n't matter . You could skip 100 pages and keep on reading as if nothing.It 's like life . Not everything happens for a reason the sequence of events is unpredictable follows no moralistic or predictable model and you can either hate it or get used to it . I decided to be the latter . ",3
"I love these books but this this was not my favorite . To be fair this man keep SO many plots and characters in the air at any one time that there just had to be a point where he 'd have to start wrapping things up . Logically I know this to be true . My advice for the brave reader who is thinking about taking them on is to not worry about losing track of details . Martin does a great job of reminding the reader who everyone is as he goes just keep plugging along and you 'll be fine . ",3
"Just read it you wo n't be able to put it down . One of the best in the series hand down . ",4
"This was intended to be a companion book with FFC explaining what happens in other parts of the realm during the same points in time . For those complaining that it does n't move fast enough there are two more books coming . This is classic Martin storytelling . I found it a great read ! ",4
"Look yes the book was long . I actually reread the first four books before reading this one so it was a big chunk of reading . Yes lots did n't happen during it there were slow interludes . But some stuff does and so I was okay with the book until the ending.So as not to give away spoilers it felt like Martin had no idea what to do next to get his characters moving forward so he shook the snow globe up or if you prefer knocked over the game table . And he did n't do it cleverly . He just said hmmm no idea where to go so let 's just abruptly do a bunch of things to disrupt stuff.Really wondering about the characters we 've come to know and in many cases admire against our will . Will there be a whole new set next book ? And by the way very tired of the way Cersei is being portrayed . She 's written as a dumb blond prey to her emotions sluttish power grabbing whatever . Yet somehow she keeps ending up winning more or less . I think he should portray her as a lot more clever than he does and stop heaping so much scorn on her.Anyway I really thought this was going to be the last book when I got it . But guess not . Will I read the next one ? probably assuming I 'm not dead by the time it comes out or that I have n't totally forgotten about the series it took seeing previews of the TV show to remind me of the book series and finally got me to check to see if there was a new one out . ",2
"A disclosure I am a great fan of GRRM and a bigger fan of A Song of Ice and Fire series . I have read the first three books 3 times and the AFFC 2 times could not stomach a third read.I doubt I will ever read the ADWD a second time.The book felt like a long march round and round or a long sailing and in the end reaching nowhere ",2
"One of the best books I 've read . Can not wait for the next one . Love the tempo of the battles . Highly recommend this book ",4
"Dance with Dragons is book 5 of the Song Of Ice & Fire series . I feel like I 'm reading a soap opera . At the end of book 5 we are no closer to a conclusion to this story than we were when book 1 ended . I have to admit it 's a page turner but I hate falling in love with characters and having to endure their death sometimes more than once . Now we have to wait until God knows when to read book 6 . I 'm watching the HBO series and in a way I like it better than the books . I 'm happy that Tyrion still has his nose in the TV show . He 's my favorite character so I hope George Martin does n't OFF him . I might not read book 6 if that happens . So if you 're a person who loves long novels hates when they end and can put up with a bit of blood and guts this is your book . But hey ! Start with book 1 Game of Thrones . ",3
"Besides two major crescendos this book follows A Feast for Crows in spirit as well as story.GRRM continues to keep you in suspense with each of your favorite characters but to what end ? Where there was always the everpresent Sword of Damocles for each character that is pivotal to the plot but in this novel I feel more like I am being left in the dark rather than simply kept in suspense.I held off on reading this book ever since it was released simply because I have been reading GRRM 's books for about 13 years and have grown tired of waiting years and years before getting back in touch with the characters I once felt so deeply for . Now that I have read it I am glad I waited and perhaps would have waited longer so that I would have less of a gap between stories.By the end of the novel so much is left up in the air and the pieces that have already fallen have done so to the detriment of the story as a whole . I love the setting the cultures the varied perspectives and the inner and outer dialogue you get as the reader of this series but I fear that I am beginning to slowly lose interest the further along the story progresses.If you want to read this book to just keep up with the series or because you appreciate GRRM 's writing style go for it . It is a decent read . If you are looking for a magnificent work of fantasy though you may have to look elsewhere . ",2
"I started to feel George RR Martin fatigue while reading a A Feast for Crows . It seeemed like there was a lot of Bcharacters and I felt the writing and plotting had gotten sloppier compared to the first three books . Though I had still been excited about A Dance when I read all the negative reviews I put off reading it indefinately until recently when I got to watching the TV series and decided I 'd try it . And I have to admit I enjoyed it.That 's not to say it does n't have its slow parts . Reading a 1000 page book which is part of a series of seven is truly a massive time investment and things seem to go a lot quicker in Westeros than they do in Essos . At times I was really wondering why there is no raven system on that giant continent to speed things up but I did enjoy nearly all the Westeros chapters and characters.I like the complexity of the world Martin creates and the mortality with which he imbues his characters . Sure he resurrects them sometimes but I feel like this is never a random turn of the plotwheel . Sometimes the reason for the surprise is that we were caught up in rumor or deception a common factor historically . Other times I feel the character has undergone a metamorphosis and so it is like we are being introduced to a new character.Some readers have lamented Daenyrus indecisiveness but it is important to remember she is a just teenage girl handicapped by her good intentions and in the corrupting influence of the decadent orient . Who of us who becomes decisive remains that way without relapse ? Also bemoaned is a certain new character who seems minor and random but I would say he is important in that he is both a foil and bridge to Westeros . It would be awkward if Daeny just jumped off her dragon when she got to Westeros and nobody knew her.Others dislike the unresolved plot points but this is what the next two books are for . Perhaps a bit could have been cut from this book but it is still not the infinite series of Robert Jordan and his succesors by any means . If there are some warts on Martin 's tomes show me better . Tolkien is long dead . Marion Zimmer Bradley would have you drowning in a sea of estrogen her mortality is of greying hairs her world a subverted one and most of her characters boring . Let 's face it there is no one better than Martin . ",3
"While Martin is very creative he can also be very wordy . This saga seems to go on endlessly with little closure and definitely not much success by the main characters . Many adult themes . Probably wo n't buy book six . Lost me on several of the more advanced conceptual descriptions such as the trees world with the black sky . Martin drops hundreds if not thousands of names which is extremely distracting . I have no idea what role some of those individuals play in the overall story or the history . ",2
"Bought this in papersorry I did . A five year wait for this ? I was reminded of one of those halfazzed Star Trek movies they did just to keep the series going . Even soap operas kill off people and end storylines . This book could have been okay if he 'd had the balls to complete some threads and not just worried about the next payday . We are n't all morons out here George . ",0
"This book contains a Monty Python and the Holy Grail reference on page 325 of the hardcover . That 's about all you need to know about the quality of this entry into the series.If you want just a bit more know that an entire plotline contained in the book 4 chapters or so could have been excised and reinserted at the end in a couple of paragraphs.Marginally better than AFFC but only because there 's no Samwell Tarly . As hard as the characters try to get stuff accomplished nothing really happens . ",0
"Still reading this but the story gets better and better as I go . The characters are more familiar in this one than the last . ",3
"This book book 4 in the series was slower than the other three but still excellently written . Many of the main characters spend the majority of the book moping Dany & Jon Snow or drifting fairly aimlessly Tyrion & Mormont . Stannis and his queens men finally leave the wall but barely . They encounter no Lannisters to advance that plot.I 'm still rereading it read it as it came out then reread the other 3 and then it again and enjoying it but I wish it had progressed the story a lot farther . ",3
"the greatest tragedy of this series is how long I have to wait for the next installment . I swear my children will be grown and out of the house before I get to finish this series . ",4
"Do not open this book unless all prior entries in the saga are part of your past and fully relevant to your future . Approach only after fully digesting the contents of preceding material with the characters bonded like old friends the noble families along with their gods and legends etched in memory and the plot twists charted as indelible lessons . Do not read without sufficient leisure and forged determination to pursue an uninterupted course from page one trough the final words of the epilogue . If you come expecting resolution you are misinformed and yet the worlds within deliver satiation in abundance . Short of an end this installment lacks for nothing and if the exploits of these noble rivals contentious armies exotic faiths local tribes judicious folk and wandering fools goes on forever eternity will surely come too soon . A final word of warning about the dragons maneating fire breathing creatures that consume flesh freshly roasted to a crisp . Though the full force of their impact has yet to be felt on the tale their power is much in evidence on pages with edges singed . ",4
"I devoured the first 4 books . Now I am almost at the end of the 5th and I do not know if I find all the answers . I want to know if the silverhaired queen is still alive after flying on the back of the dragon . and much more . ",4
"Let me say I think GRRM has a great sense of character and can do a plot twist like nobody 's business.That said does he know how to wrap up ANY storyline without a death to the main character in that storyline ? We 've invested hours and pages in characters and plotlines only to have brand new characters introducedAGAIN and a character we are invested in killed off because GRRM does n't know what else to do with them.I was hoping to find Dance With Dragons have more focus and development on Jon Arya Bran and their wolves Tyrion Cersie Jamie and Dany and Sam . Was I disappointed ? In the end yes big time . possible spoiler aheadI got a lot of back & forth with Dany and Meeren and almost no development of her relationship with the dragons or who else may ride them.I got bits of Arya 's growth but not much and only toward the end of the book.Bran a few chapters of odd situations that seemed like filler and a way to put him aside.Jon got chapters about his dealings with Wildings and Stannis but not the Others or Ghost.Cersie chapters toward the end of the book ending in her being marginalized and set aside.Jamie one chapter only ! Sam nothingTyrion Hurray ! Some interesting bits of intrigue but not what I was hoping for.New people lots and lots and I did n't care about any of them at all.I loved books 1 & 2 and they got me hooked on this series . Book 3 was annoying at times but I stuck with it . Book 4 was a dissappointment because of the new characters but I gave it a chance & held out hope for this book . That said I will not recomment this book or series to anyone and I doubt I 'll read anything else in the series in the future . GRRM is a good writer too bad he can not end a story . Maybe a new editor would help but I doubt it . ",0
"If words are wind then so are letters in much of this installment . The main stages here are the Wall and Slavers Bay with a secondary stage of Dorne the Iron Isles and Kings Landing . Briefly mentioned are the Riverlands and Winterfell.There are as usual unexpected deaths at the end Tyrion 's interesting adventures and the sudden return of almost forgotten characters . I was n't interested in Arya 's adventures nor Bran 's in this installment . Both of them seem to be no longer a part of the main narrative and are just added in for completeness and to fill up pages . Of course this is only going off of what we have so far . The main thing to remember about all this is that anyone can die and the only constant is the rat race for the Iron Throne.It is definitely true that there are just too many throw away characters in this one it can be hard to care much about them or their plotlines . The WildlingsCrows and all the many characters of Slavers Bay etc . make it hard to follow . It seems that the characters of Slavers Bay and the WildlingsCrows will be forgotten once the previously introduced main characters that are there move on in life or death . They are only in bulk to be thought of as one large character kind of like the Wights or the Dragons . I found myself feeling like the proverbial are we there yet kids.The whole split chronology is a detriment as well . It means that almost half the characters are not reacting or participating in any of the events of the other half splendid isolation in time and place . Are the messenger crows not working here ? This splitting is one reason why this novel is so unfocused it 's almost as if Martin is just adding stuff to keep his page count up . The constant retelling of the near past is annoying . He could have written Parts 4 and 5 as one book and cut out a lot of unnecessary details and people that showed up in Part 5 . This would n't have worked for the marketing dept . though the release schedule and premier dates dictate too much . I think that 's part of why he keeps changing the number of books . I would n't be surprised if he extended it to 10 books . We may have a new LOST on our hands here ! I have to say that it 's a definite liability that this and it 's sequels are being fleshed out while a TV show is being produced of the series . This all smells too much of marketing to me was n't it around the start of Season 2 TV show that this novel debuted ? Was the series even extended simply for cash and future TV seasons ? I think this makes the rest of the books very reactive and subservient to the needs of HBOthe dragons largely disappear conveniently must be a TVgraphics budget issue and weakens Martins credibility as a writer but I guess once a TV writer always a TV writer . It 's almost as if you should just skip the first 500700 pages and just read the rest to get the gist of the novel . So the next novel will be released in April 201Xnear TV premiere time or thereabouts I 'm sure . There is n't even a preview of the next novel in this one at the end like the first four books ominous sign that.In short it 's worth a read but do n't expect the tight focused story of the first four or the introduction of any new characters you 'll care much about . ",2
"Unlike many who have reviewed this book descriptions of barley porridge and bends sinister do n't put me off . In fact I think many fantasy writers neglect the basics of medieval life whilst they stroke their immense swords . I 'm also not one of the readers who get all selfrighteous because an author takes too long to write a book . It 's his living his book and I am a paying customer not an investor.Having said that I was still somewhat disappointed by this latest instalment for basically the same reason outlined by others who have reviewed it lack of progress.The key POV character storylines advance very little throughout the novel . Indeed what little advancement they do make seems somewhat negated by the end points of the threads at the close of the book . Meanwhile other threads just seem to vaporise and some of the new ones that are introduced are rendered somewhat pointless by their climaxes.In other words the book seems about 95 % padding and 5 % substance.The use of journeys both physical and mental for so many of the characters is part of the problem . The plot lines become like so many tedious car trips . You watch the scenery roll past to the point of boredom hoping against hope that there will be something of interest in the next town you enter . Only to realise that the next landmark is fairly much the same as the last.Of course Martin does throw in some of his trademark surprises at the end but they 're starting to become contrived . Worse still the reappearance of some characters we thought killed now makes anyone else 's apparent demise less certain . Like when Indiana Jones goes over a cliff and you just know that he 's not going to fall to his death because well he 's the hero.All up I wo n't give the book one star because it 's still a very richly written piece of work . But it 's not worth the price I paid for it on preorder . Perhaps the worst condemnation I can give it is that if you did not read this book I imagine that you could pick up the next one in the series and not have any trouble following the story . ",1
"I waited and waited for this book to finally come ! Thankfully I have it on Kindle because toting these thick paperbacks around is not fun . Well this book was worth the wait ! Jon is the Lord Commander Dany is Queen of Meeren and Tyrion embarks on another adventure with a long lost Targaryen in disguise . At least Cersei gets her just punishment by the Faith of the Seven.Reader please read this book very carefully . There are a lot of details that is important to the plot of the character 's backstory and who will ultimately sit on the Iron Throne . Martin tells a lot of riddles and it takes some time to figure them out . I have started to reread all of the books and have picked up details missed in the first run.Martin is a truly gifted writer with an incredible imagination . I will be sad when this series comes to an end but it 's been an incredible journey ! ",3
"Once again a wonderful read from Mr. Martin . I 've heard people say this book was slow but I love all his detail so slow or fast it was still a great read . Now about the next book ca n't wait ! ",4
"I 'm hooked on the journey but it 's sometimes like walking either through a swamp or through a field of butterflies trying to keep track of the new names of characters and overlong descriptions . Nevertheless I 'm going to buy Book 6 when it appears ! ",3
"I enjoyed this book part 4b of the series although I agree with many of the critics too long unnecessary new characters little resolved . But I love the series first 3 books are 5 stars I would really rate this a 3 12.My question however is this I have heard there are two more books before series ends . George RR Martin is 64 years old and it took 6 years to release this tome . Does he have it in him especially with the other distraction of the GREAT HBO series Game of Thrones which I have heard he is also very involved to finish 2 more 7001000 page books . ? Or is this another job for Brandon Sanderson the person who is now finishing the late Robert Jordan 's Wheel of Time series Good Luck George ! ! ! ",3
"Language and imagery continue to get more illicit.The only characters that I still liked in the series keep getting killed . ",0
"Wish I had waited until I could check it out of the library . Pointless meanness to characters I had come to admire . ",1
"There is just too much book here for the story to go almost no where . It 's still a good story but reading it is a chore . ",2
"The Game of Thrones peaked in book # 3 for me . These last 2 books have been dragging and not as exciting as the first three . ",1
"I was really disappointed in GRRM 's latest effort . Dance with Dragons dragged on almost as bad as Feast for Crows . The plot of the Fire and Ice series makes little progress although many characters get fleshed out nicely . It is like buying a software upgrade that changes the menus to be clearer but does not advance the technology at all.I liked the character development but now GRRM will make us wait five more years and maybe he will figure out how to tie all these tales together to move the plot along . Tommen may die on the Iron Throne of old age before we find out who can unseat him.The series is almost like a soap in that you read about people dying and they pop back up alive in this book . Brandon Stark . Arya Stark Theon Greyjoy and a few others come back from the dead in this one . ",2
"George R.R . Martin A Dance With DragonsThis book became annoyingly slowpaced compared to the first three books and even the fourth.I felt like several of the early POV characters were old friends that I was reunited with especially since I had n't ready book 3 in awhile and that 's when we last saw them.I like Jon 's tense negotiations with Stannis . Jon seemed to be trying to offer neutral advice like a maester might . Also I wonder if he was trying to get Stannis out of the way by sending him elsewhere . I loved the setting feel of most of the Jon chapters.I 'm honestly unsure what I feel about Daenerys ' leadership.Theon 's story was an amazing chilling description of torture.I identified with Tyrion 's cover story strategy basing it on personal experience he did have which would help him stay in character and make it plausible.I loved it the way Davos talked trash when speaking the truth at Manderly 's court . Heck a lot of people in that hall were being brutally honest . Even as a Robb fan Rhaegar Frey had a point with his rant about Robb 's poor decisions.The theory that Bloodraven is Bran 's guru is obvious when reading that Bran chapter.Obviously the RamsayArya wedding was a cruel farce but I liked the detail about how weddings work for followers of the old gods . ",2
"This book is quite boring and provides little to no suspense . I would strongly recommend that readers avoid this novel.I skipped the fourth book in the series A Feast For Crows because of horrific wordofmouth feedback and should not have invested time reading this novel either.The first book in this series was excellent and the second one was quite good but each successive novel is more tedious than the prior one . Needless to say A Dance with Dragons is the most boring novel of the series thus far.The author continually drones on and on about inane nonconsequential matters . He spends inordinate amounts of time describing scenery in the most minute detail and also subjects the readers to numerous narratives that possess zero entertainment value . For example readers should not read a single Daenerys narrative they are the equivalent of watching paint dry.At this point Mr. Martin is solely writing for the sake of writing . My view is that he plans to extend the serious indefinitely in order to reap as large a monetary windfall as possible . There is a colossal difference in entertainment value between this book and the first book in the series.I gave this book 2stars rather than 1star because it is the perfect book to read prior to retiring for the evening . I normally finish a novel every week or two but spent 3months reading this novel . The book will undoubtedly put any reader to sleep within 520 minutes . This book is perfect for someone who is hoping to fall asleep quickly . ",1
"Six years in the making over a thousand pages in length while A Dance with Dragons has gone on to become an instant super bestseller as well as the hardcover outselling the eBook edition sadly the best thing about this book is really that fantastically mesmerizing cover . This mighty tome falls more in line with its less well received and not so well reviewed predecessor A Feast for Crows than with the groundbreaking first three books of A Song of Ice and Fire . It seems that time may not be the best thing for George R. R. Martin when it comes to writing his epic series as he seems to enjoy spending more time describing scenery and food and anything gruesome or unpleasant than moving the story along . He goes on tangents taking trips with new characters that appear to have little bearing on the main plot or spends literally hundreds of pages with characters readers have come to know so well and love . . . and nothing bloody happens ! Martin is becoming what can only really be truthfully described as Jordanian no he 's not immigrating to Jordan but writing in the style of the man who became the true master of the massive mass market Robert Jordan.Warning here be spoilers.In the North around the Wall King Stannis Baratheon seems to spend a lot of time trying to decide what to do with no real power or army to use while listening to Lady Melisandre who continues to spout enigmatic prophecies that make little sense yet readers do get to enjoy a chapter from her viewpoint for the first time . Meanwhile Jon Snow is elected as the 998th Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch as he must deal with not just enemies beyond the Wall but also amongst the very men he leads and is in charge of . He works with the wildlings bringing them south of the wall to bolster his forces in preparation for a possible attack from the Others it seems to be an interesting act of diplomacy but goes on for far too many pages with little action or continuing story taking place.Much of the rest of the book takes place to the far east . Martin has provided a couple of new maps but nothing so clearly defined and comprehendible as the great continent of Westeros . Tyrion flees to Pentos drowning himself in wine . He is forced to join with a group traveling to Meereen along with the apparently not so dead prince Aegon Targaryen . Tyrion as he always does manages to get involved in a whole variety of adventures including the meeting of another dwarf and a female no less ! Daenerys is the character that seems most put through the ringer in this book much like Cercei was in A Feast for Crows . She is no longer the tough proud defiant woman that everyone feared and not just because she has three growing dragons . Having conquered Meereen she should be the unstoppable unquestionable queen that she is and yet insurrection is afoot and Daenerys can not seem to decide what to do perhaps it is because she has become obsessed and besotted with one of her soldiers and seems to be able to think of little else when he is nearby and yet he is of lower class and can not possibly be her husband . The black dragon Drogon meanwhile is running rampant through the countryside as growing teenage dragons do and Daenerys has no idea how to control him.Finally there is Quentyn Martell Prince of Dorne whose story comes from nowhere as we follow his trek across the lands to Meereen where he hopes to woo Daenerys by enslaving one of her dragons . It does not end well for him . Interspersed throughout the lengthy book are other POV chapters from the likes of Bran Stark Davos Seaworth Reek who is in fact the very not dead Theon Greyjoy Arya Stark Victarion Greyjoy as well as some surprise cameos from Jaime and Cercei Lannister . These appearances may not have be so incomprehensible if their storylines were allowed to go somewhere and yet many of them barely get one chapter leaving the reader wondering why they were ever added to this book in the first place . What was the point ? Especially when many hundreds of pages are spent on other main characters with very little happening with them other than plenty of description of what they 're wearing what they 're eating and what the scenery looks like . Pure Jordanian ! At a recent signing George R. R. Martin briefly brought up one of his most tumultuous periods in the sixyear writing saga of A Dance with Dragons saying that in a year or two who would discuss it in greater detail once everyone had read the book but confessing that he had sacrificed at least a year at what he refers to as his Meereenese Knot in trying to decide how events were to transpire and what characters and POVs were to be involved featuring rewrite after rewrite after rewrite . It seems Martin may have in fact written himself into a deep dark pit of despair that he has n't really been able to write himself out of . Perhaps he should 've scrapped everything and started again ? After sacrificing over a half a decade of his life and the reader 's impatient waiting he could n't exactly do that . Instead the result is a book that is too long has too little going on and falls behind A Feast for Crows in that it is that much longer with less important story happening.There may be a number of readers under the same delusion suffered by those who professed the excellence and genius of the Star Wars prequels starting with A Phantom Menace but over time have come to realize the error of their ways and the true reality of the situation . A Dance with Dragons just simply is n't that good of a book but does serve to further the story somewhat and fill in the details with many words and many pages and little action . At the end readers will certainly be left unsatisfied as they ponder on the possibilities of the penultimate book in the sevenbook series assuming it will stay at this number with The Winds of Winter where winter will supposedly have finally arrived . The question remains if winter is finally here how long will it be before readers actually get to read about it ? Originally written on August 9 2011 Alex C. Telander.For more reviews go to ",2
"One of the best in series . I think I understand the characters better due to the history offers in the book . Long read . I had it on audio and readable or I would still be reading.. do n't start if you do n't have time to spare ",4
"I have eagerly awaited this book since I finished the first four Of A Song of Ice and Fire in 2008 . The first three books of the series had superior plot AND characterization . Each aspect did n't suffer or be neglected for the sake of the other one . Then came the 4th installment A Feast for Crows . Compared to other works of the FantasySciFi genre AFFC would rank above most . It falls short compared to GRRM 's other works . It seemed that back story brought everything to a halt in this series . I hoped that A Dance With Dragons would speed things up a bit . I will give a qualified yes for plot advancement for this installment.Spoiler Alert ! Some of the problems of AFFC and this latest installment can be traced to the ending ofA Storm of Swords A Song of Ice and Fire Book 3 . Two of the main characters Jon Snow and Daenyreus both had spectacular victories . Jon Snow being named Lord Commander of The Wall and Princess Dany winning Meereen . The problem being they were both stuck in a literary conundrum . I was thinking at the end of that book So how will GRRM get Jon away from the Wall and get Dany to Westoros ? In AFFC despite good character back story and attention being given to the Iron Islands the loose ends were still there.In ADWD some plot was advanced but there more loose ends were created . Dany did leave Meereen . Jon Snow may have left The Wall and the story like Ned and Robb . I say may because there have been some characters in this saga that have more lives than the luckiest cat.END SPOILER ALERTSome plot loose ends have been tied up in a ADWD for Jon and Dany . Many more loose ends though have been created in the overall story.I welcomed the addition of Ser Barristan Selmy in the story . There was detail provided to the Eastern Lands and The North . It provided more background and travelogue for GRRM 's fantasy world . I do n't mind this at all . Sometimes I thought Anthony Bourdain hijacked the novel with food descriptions.I questioned some other character additions like Quentyn Martell . Why ? When all was said and done with this character I had wondered why was he put in this story ? Whether you love hate or are indifferent to GRRM 's characters they 've all contributed to the development of this epic in one way or another . The character of Quentyn Martell did not meet any of these criteria.There was another intriguing addition that brings to mind the historical Perkin Warbeck . I 'm on the fence with this one . I 'm not sure if it 's a useless red herring or something that will add believable complications thereby adding interest to the story.Overall this book is a good read for background . BTW this is not a stand alone novel . If you have never read the ASOIAF series and want to read it please start with A Game of Thrones . ",3
"Definitely the author has no qualms in killing characters.There are some that I would like to still have in the picture ",3

"With A Dance with Dragons the 5th novel of A Song of Ice and Fire there is a sense that George R.R . Martin has instilled a few too many plotlines . As there are so many characters doing so many things it makes me wonder if the story will ever be wrapped up in my lifetime . Despite this fact I still finished A Dance with Dragons with more of a positive outlook than others might . I 'd also like to point out that I was spoiled before I read this book so whatever preconceptions or hopes I had were quickly washed away before I read even the first pages . As such I feel like I was able to enjoy it for what it was.After killing his father in cold blood Tyrion has left King 's Landing to go east in search for Daenerys Targaryen . The talk is she is in Meereen preparing her army and growing her dragons in order to invade Westeros . As Tyrion makes his journey he also goes through his own personal growth as he must cope with his killing of Tywin and Shae . Daenerys is having her own troubles controlling Meereen . Many different forces seem to be conspiring against her and her rule is on the verge of being overturned . She is having to watch herself in everything she does . One wrong move and she is done for . Meanwhile up north Jon Snow is having a tough time getting the Night 's Watch to accept the Wildings past the Wall not to mention Stannis and Melisandre are both there as an added threat . Other plots emerge from Bran as he continues his journey north of the Wall from Reek trying to find out what his name in his past life was and from Arya who continues her own training to become an assassin . Of course there are several other point of view characters as is GRRM 's way.Tyrion Daenerys and Jon are the three that push this narrative forward . They each go through their own transformations . Tyrion never really seemed like himself this time around but I can let that past as I did n't really expect him to be his jolly 'ol self after killing two people he knew quite well or at least thought so . Dany and Jon both learn that ruling over a lot of people is n't quite what it seems and everything they decide to do just would n't work . Both of them are really put through the ringer as they fail time and time again . Martin definately understands the concept of having your characters fail before they succeed . On another note the couple of chapters from Bran were just downright beautifully written . Martin was at his best in writing these I just wish there had been more of it.Despite all this A Dance with Dragons is still really faulty . The first half of the novel was slow in building up its tension and the second half seemed to have no narrative coherence . Chapters appear from characters like Jaime and Cersei without really accomplishing anything . And while there is n't an anticlimax in regards to the internal struggles any fights or battles that might be expected never happened . There 's a sense that Martin dug himself into a hole and while I believe he has found his way out there was no way that he was going to get out in just a novel 's time . For a while I 've been wondering if anything could have been done to the structure of A Dance with Dragons to give it a more satisfactory ending but I really could n't figure out anything that would work . The cliffhanger in Winterfell is well used in my opinion and would n't change that . It is the cliffhanger in Meereen though that I wish could have been better resolved . Unfortunately I think it is quite obvious that Battle of Meereen would simply be too long . I can honestly see it taking up half of the next book.Hopefully Martin decides to showcase the battle without pausing to go elsewhere . It would make for an exciting few hundred pages to see him go through the four or so point of view characters and no one else.Through all its faults I still liked the book . I thought it was entertaining though not on the level of A Game of Thrones A Clash of Kings or A Storm of Swords . I am remaining optimistic and feel confident that Martin has figured out the Meereenese knot and as such will get The Winds of Winter out in the next two years . He has a lot of work to do though with all these different characters . It 's about time he kills off a few of them and keeps them dead.I 'm not sure people will enjoy A Dance with Dragons . It is a lot of build up but not much else . I enjoyed it for what it is another piece of a very long story . Very long.3.55 ",3
"Great book though I wish it were available in paper back and in the same dimensions as the rest of the books so they looked nice sitting next to eachother . I previously purchased the box set . But its a lengthy read but definitely worth it ! ",4
"Well like many I finished this book very frustrated after like some have already said stories drag and drag endlessly with no climax in any of them . The abuse of anticlimax began to drive me nuts I felt like reading Ann Rice 's Queen Of The Damned all over again . Still I always enjoy his style as all his books you can find pretty pearls of writing worth of quoting here and there . My first impression after finishing this book was that with the imminent broadcast of HBO 's GOT miniseries the publishing house put pressure on Martin to wrap whatever he had try to get something that would work as an end and hand it over for it 's quick publishing and that is what happened . I read he at least took out 4 already written chapters to save for The Winds Of Winter . So this book should be seen as a bridge where action just was build up to reach it 's climax only that we 'll probably will have to wait another 6 years ! Let us hope not ! ",2
"a bit slowly for my hunger of this story xDIt 's amazing how you end up rooting for all the characters some more than others obviouslyAre n't all perspective right no matter how opposed they may stand ? ",4
"So I 've read a bunch of reviews where the comments are quite negative . Hummmm I wholeheartedly disagree . I found this book riveting and amazing . The characters ' development widens and there is plenty of action . Many will say that the plot slowed down but I found that the story base broadened out . Dragons were the main plot even though they were seldom part of the action . All over the world people were speaking about these dragons and plotting how to either use them or abuse them . It was like everyone was dancing with the idea of dragons . I found all five of the books great . The writing was excellent . I wish Martin would finish the series and soon ! . And I wish I could find more authors like Martin . Any suggestions ? ? ? ",4
"Dance has all of the qualities you 'd expect from the previous four novels . I deducted 1 star for two minor complaints I wanted overarching plots to be advanced further . Some parts are slow and boring at times especially the travel chapters in Essos . Inclusion of these throwaway character development scenes made lack of plot advancement more frustrating.Overall it 's a good continuation of the series but I expected a little more . ",3
"I purchased it on the kindle because the softcover was not yet out . To be honest though I plan on buying the entire game of thrones collection on the kindle . While I normally perfer to hold a book the Ice and Fire series is extremely heavy and causes tears in my purse . On the kindle I recieved it for a much cheaper price then the hardcover and it did n't cause my bag to rip at all . ",4
"To put it nicely this book is a mess . It seems that the author spent all his time coming up with complicated names for minor characters and locations and no time at all on where he taking the characters we grew care about in the earlier books . There are very few interesting dramatic scenes and many of those take place offstage we just hear about them later . I often find myself flipping back to see if I 've missed something as some POV chapters begin by referencing things that have happened while our attention was focused elsewhere . There are long boring passages about various journeys including mindnumbing lists of fleets of shipswhich ones are missing which ones are still with the fleet which ships they commandeer along the wayno battles to speak of they just acquire them . I am only about 34 of the way through it and I am eagerly awaiting the end not because I expect the end to make up for the total lack of story so far just because it will be over and I can move on and read something else .

"I 've been reading the series for three months and this story was a great edition . You never know what 's next and the characters are all well developed and keep you on your toes ! ",4
"I remember finishing Storm of Swords like some people remember the Kennedy assassination.I know exactly where I was and how loud I screamed and I could n't wait to read the next book . The wait felt agonizing and I practically kicked down the door of my local bookstore when A Feast for Crows hit the shelves . Within four pages I was engrossed but thought Martin 's decision to split the narrative was a rotten one and could n't believe that no one was able to stop him . Perhaps his publishers were so eager to see the next book in print they did n't care that Martin was suddenly writing like a rambling old man tanked on tranquilizers . After years of waiting I kinda gave up on the prospect of the final book ever becoming my mind candy but when I spotted it at the bookstore I could n't resist . Sixty pages deep I was bored out of my mind and started skimming and skipping chapters which resulted in missing absolutely nothing . Instead of A Dance with Dragons this book should be called A Wish for Washy since page after page is dedicated to meandering conversations between suddenly flummoxed characters incapable of toddlerlevel decision making . I ca n't believe how bloated this book is with meaningless empty interactions between characters Martin has clearly forgotten as much as I had . Instead of rooting for my favorite characters I found myself hoping one would stumble upon blueprints for the sort of advanced weaponry that would wipe out the entire cast in a single swoop and spare the world any further sequels .

"Only good point of this book his writing skills are still sharp as ever.Now bad points I dont pay money to read about nothing happening . Plot doesnt go anywhere.There is no character development or movement in the timeline.Coming to violence he must really have a dark and dreary mind if he can not write a single chapter of hope of unsullied dreams . I am tired of reading about his endless sufferings that the good guys have to suffer . By trying to make his bad guys so bad he is making them look like fools . & he is forgotten about the main threat from behind the Wall . There is no appearance of them in the entire novel.I was compelled to write such a scathing review of him because he is a wellestablised behaving like he can get away anything.One star is because of the beautiful writing .

"Reread the whole series before getting DwD on my birthday . This book was longawaited and did not disappoint . I 'm going to go through and read it again soon . ",4
"This is book five in the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R.R . Martin . This writer and series is similar in many respects to Robert Jordan 's Wheel of Time Series if you like this kind of reading . This particular book in the series I found to be much more pleasurable reading than the previous book . The previous book got bogged down in names places and unnecessary Machiavellian intrigue that tended to make it difficult to follow or did not add to the story at hand . The present book is more concise and keys upon issues of reader interest from previous books and the story . The work flows really well and maintains the reader 's intrigue . I think that this particular book is a great read and captures the reader 's imagination . I could not put it down . In all the whole series was very well done and is probably a classic in this genre of fantasy work . ",3
"I wish books 4 and 5 had n't been divided the way they had but I still enjoy the story all the same . However I hate getting all caught up on an ongoing series . How long will we have to wait for the next installment ? And then how long after that for the final book ? It says something good about a story when you are left wanting more and ca n't wait to see how it all turns out . Just do n't leave us waiting too long please . ",3
"I love this series . This is one of the best books I have read I a long time . I devoured the pages could not put it down ",4
"Had there been testtospeech and had this been loanable I might have given this book 5 stars . At least when I first thought about buying it there was no TTS . Now it looks like it has TTS . Good ! But still not loanable . For the price that is ridiculous ! No it did n't have those amenities when I found a way to borrow it anyway nor was it my kind of book . The whole series is manheavy war blood and an attitude that is n't of man 's realm is less than . The females that were strong in their own right were never allowed to fly in their own way as they were still possessions of the male society . Dany and Arya were as close to being a unique beings as this world would allow.But in spite of my complaints this was an excellent series . The author was amazing . The world he created was real the characters so well developed that I feel I will miss many of them as friends . How he kept track of their voices and points of view amazes me.Even so am I glad I am finished with this series ? Yes ! Um except for the fact that I have to wait to find out what has happened to all of the people I did learn to care about.Is it worth reading ? Yes . Is it worth the praise ? I do n't think so . If a book or series is to be a classic I think it should move the world to want to raise above war and selfcentered machismo . This series has not done that . But you make up your own mind about it and we can agree to disagree about what makes a classic . ",2
"A GREAT BOOK SERIES IN DEPTH WHEN YOU START THE SERIES WITH GAME OF THRONES YOU REALISE HOW MASSIVE THIS SERIES IS WITH ALL OF THE CHARACTERS BUT BY PAGE 200 YOU ARE HOOKED AND IT IS EASY TO FOLLW ",4
"Mr. Martin prolongs the magic with another meaty tome that mostly page count and little action . Extraneous plot threads are summarily extinguished as not a whole lot happens to the protagonists of the story . I 'm guessing the publisher andor author thought the reading public both of them would gobble up anything written in the Westoros universe so long as it had Martin 's name on it . ",2
"As always Mr. Martins eloquent writing stile has the reader at the edge of the chair . The book is so well written that ending it is like saying goodbye to dear friends . Hopefully the next book wo n't take so long to be released . ",4
"Best book in the series . I ca n't wait for the next one . The show is n't enough to get my game of thrones fix ",4
"Have any of the readers noticed the use of as well . Author uses as well a lot . There is a description of something with an additional item added with as well attached . It is like me saying I have a Toyota and a Chevrolet as well . Not a problemjust noticed . I am very pleased and engrossed with these books . My complaint would be along the line of purchasing the 1st 4 as a set at a price higher than the similar set with the first five a set 5 books at a lower price than the subsequent set of 5 . Also book 6 is late . ",4
"I 'm not sure why people said nothing happened in this book . A lot of stuff happened it just ended before the things that happened could be resolved . But it 's like the middle of the series . I give it four stars because that was only mildly disappointing . Other than that I enjoyed what the characters went through and the building tension of what is to come next . ",3
"What is amazing to me is how close the TV series is to what is in the books . How they manage some of it is beyond me . Excellent read ! ! Definitely worth reading the whole series . I could hardly wait to get to each of the books in succession . Very well written . The extensive detail about all the various families and how their interactions ebb and flow or should I say clash and slash sometimes ! ! ",4
"Enjoyed this book almost as much as the third in the series . Looking forward to the next . Great continuation of the saga ",3
"Excellent continuation of a great story ! ! ! Lots of surprises action and suspense . A must read for any fan of the series ! ",4
"I did not like the way the author separated the last 2 books . The timeline was off and confusing . However it was still an excellent read and I can not wait for the next book to come out . ",3
"I love these books but they keep raising questions and not giving any answers . I really just want to know how things are going to line up to end it all but overall another win from George RR Martin . A must read for fans of the series . ",3
"I waited and waited for the paperback to come out so eager to read about my characters again just to find out they did nothing . So many pages for George R.R . Martin to say so much and so little at the same time . Save yourself some time Winter still has n't come . ",2
"Just another great addition to the great series I ca n't wait to read Winds of Winter and see how everything pans out and who dies next . ",4
"Still lolling @ Macaroni 's review . Tres amusing because a lot of it is true.While i feel that there was some progress in the story it did kind of crawl by . It seems all the interesting stuff gets skipped over and we pick up chapters wondering who its about and what happened and why we never get to read it except through some anticlimactic flashback.I blazed through the first 3 books but these last 2 were a bit of a struggle . Its getting a little overdone when every time someones bites the dust I 'm not convinced they 're actually dead . By design ? Do n't know but I 'm ready for some new tricks.I think DoD ended in an interesting place though . Looking forward to # 6 and hoping for some satisfying engaging storylines versus afterthefact character narratives . ",2
"What a wild ride this series has become . I read Books 14 in three months . I tried to pace myself but this series is too amazing to put down . I also enjoy the television series . Most excellent ! ! ! ",4
"Martin once again delivers a powerful ending . I was angry at the end of the end of the book . This is a good thing Martin gets you to form a connection with the characters and when you finish you simply must know what will happen in the next book . ",4
"Martin 's tales of fantasy and fratricide are great fun . Love Danny and her dragons . Tyrion is the best dwarf character since Snow White 's crew . ",4
"This is my 2nd time reading this book series . From th first time to the 2nd and maybe a 3rd.out has always been an EPIC read . ",4
"I had to take a break between book 4 and 5 . Five was so much better . But I am very confused about the point of some characters John snow worried what happened to others and still waiting for the big battleor any battle ! Still loved it ! ",3
"I 'm only sad because of the wait for the next book A Dance with Dragons kick it 's predecessor arse . It 's my favorite book out of the ASOFAI series so far . It was n't too long and there was always something to keep me turning pages . ",4
"Loved the story and the complexity of the character interplay a must read I could n't put it down ! ! ",4
"Martin 's fifth book in this series is more of the same . It builds upon characters you think you know . There is an amazing amount of depth in this series and book five begins to reveal some of my favorite characters especially Arya . It 's not like every other fantasy out there where the good guys always win and the bad guys are the epitome of evil . It 's real life winners and losers shades of good and evil.You 'll find yourself loving hating loathing and pitying and that 's all on one character.Enjoy ! ",4
"As with the other books in this series well written immersive environment only one complaint waiting for the next one is a killer . I have already read the entire series through twic and expect to have read it a few more times before book 6 hits the shelf . ",4
"EXELLENT BUT STILL TO PRICEY.WE HAVE MOVED TOWARDS THE END WHICH I FEEL WILL BE VERY PREDICTABLE BUT I WILL HAVE TO READ THE LAST BOOK TO FIND OUT ",4
"Fantastic . I can not wait for the next book ! This brings all the characters back . The story comes together wonderfully ! I did n't want to out it down . ",4
"I ca n't wait for the next book . This is a series worthy of comparing to Lord of the rings . I wish I knew when the next one is coming out . ",4
"this was just as in gauging as before I read prior I just wonder how long this I got is going to go on themes how it 's really a TV show being written into a book . ",4
"But seriously there 's dragons winter storms political intrigues and Jaime Lannister being awesome I know right ? . It 's a pretty good read and has kept me involved and interested for weeks.Would recommend to friends for sure ! ",3
"Ooohhh.Arya ! Daenaris ! What is happening to you ? Where is the rest of the story ? Hurry ! Write the next installment . Write the next installment . Write it ! Hurry ! ",4
"I have read all 5 books in this series and am really looking forward to the release of the sixth book . I have thoroughly enjoyed them all . If the series was written at a PG13 level instead of an R level I would have given it five stars . I would not be comfortable sharing this with anyone under 17 or 18 years old which is unfortunate because it is such an engrossing storyline . It is easy to see why this is a best selling series . If you are n't concerned with the R level writing you will probably consider this a 5star book series . Enjoy . ",3
"Knowing my interest in future fiction my daughter bought me the first four books and my wife Pamela the fifth one . For this I owe them big time . The debate may rage about how good a writer Gearge RR Martin is in the classic sense but I submit he is a world class storyteller . The series is a complex superbly constructed tale spanning multiple generations and characters showcasing a vivid imagination and exceptional craft . Long may he continue . Peter . ",3
"it is fascinating once you read it you ca n't put it down and wish that it will be extended bravo ",4
"Just like the first four books before this one the story just keeps getting better . I am hoping to see a book six in the future still a lot of unanswered questions ! ",4
"This book did drag moreso than the previous four books and I did not care for the turns the story made in some parts . While I dont expect every story line to appease me after reading thousands of a story it is dissapointing for a quick and seemingly hurried ending hopefully the next book will be more pleasing . ",3
"Like many people I 've been waiting and watching the blogs to see when GRRM finally would announce that he finished this puppy . Well unfortunately it 's not been worth the wait . The characters all seem extremely two dimensional and it 's not just because I 'm reading it on a Kindle now and it seems to be that GRRM has been concentrating more on the food than on advancing the plotline . Another helping of eel pie please ! Perhaps that 's why this book took so long the author may have been eating around the world rather than writing . Anyway Daenerys simply wanders around saying I 'm only a girl and does nothing where 's our bold Khaleesi who conquored the Free Cities ? Jon Snow you know nothing . Well yes other than how to make a deal . Have to admit Jon Snow has actually become the most grownup character in this . And my poor Tyrion ! For a man who ran Westeros now doing dog and pig tricks is quite a step down and his only ambitions appear to be find Tysha and killing his siblings . But unlike before now he just goes with the flow . Actually that describes this whole book everybody goes with the flow and nobody DOES anything.Ah well it could be worse . He could spend the book writing about everybody 's dresses and Nynaeve pulling her braid . ",2
"This is a good book and an enjoyable read . If you enjoyed the first three and could at least tolerate number 4 I am heartily recommending it ! Obviouslyas many have saidit could have been more satisfying . I just reread the series after watching the HBO series in anticipation of the release of this book . I did not particularly enjoy book 4 often skimming through endless repetitive descriptions of what people were wearing or eatingthis book was better and also focused on characters I care more about . That being said the time lag between book 4 and 5 is ridiculous considering GRRM wrote in the end of the last book that he had already completed book 5 and that it would be out in a year or so ! . Will I really care about these characters and the series in another 5 or 6 years ? Admittedly it will probably take HBO about 2 to 3 years to make all of the seasons of 8 episodes to somewhat tell the story to this point . We could expect the next episode of I am making lots of money to come out shortly after one of the HBO seasons . The storyline seems to have degenerated into an I am milking this for millions epic multiPOV neverending story a la ' The Wheel of Time which I have ceased to care about after reading the first 8 or 9 volumesthe story is stale and boring and I hope the same thing does n't happen to this series . The use of cliffhangers killing off major characters miraculous resurrections in the next book slowly advancing major plot lines etc . etc . all contribute to a sense that GRRM is just banking on laughing all the way to the bank and making this a long tortuous epic with no end in sight . He could write an entire book about people sitting around and eating and what they were wearing and how they got there and people would buy it for nowoh wait he did ! WHATEVER for now this is a great story I care about some of the characters and I want to know what happens next . I hope I still feel that way after the next installmentwhich hopefully wo n't be 6 years from now ! ",2
"I should start by saying that I am a newcomer to the Fire and Ice Series . I started reading after enjoying the HBO series and was immediately hooked . I picked up the Kindle set of the first 4 books and read them all in quick succession . As soon as I finished I logged on to buy A Dance With Dragons and was surprised to see it had such a low overall rating and a glut of negative reviews from longtime fans of the books . Many reviews made it sound like the book was awful and a complete departure from the previous amazing works . Worrying I was was going to be disappointed and regret spending the $ $ I planned to just get it from the library in the future . But I am glad I decided to judge for myself.PRAISE I wish we could rate books by the half star . I could n't give it 3 stars because it was more than just OK to me . But I am not sure Like It describes how I feel about this book either . What I can say is that I think this book 's tone pacing and plot makes sense if you think of it as the middle of an epic telling of Martin 's world instead of as an individual book . This book is n't as compelling as the first 3 in the series and does n't have OMG moments like Ned 's beheading or the Red Wedding . However I do n't think it needs to have those to be successful book . We learn some new things we did n't know before and we see a different side of a few familiar characters . The story does n't progress much and nothing much gets resolved but I think that was intentional and not just to string the books out and make more money . I think Martin took a risk with DwD and achieved something very few authors do . His prose left his readers in the same place emotionally that his characters were throughout the book lost at sea frustrated unfulfilled and feeling like what they long for is just within reach yet so far beyond their grasp . Somewhat manipulative and cruel = yes . But I do n't think it was a result of poor storytelling . I think it was intentional to some degree and effective.CRITICISM A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons should have been one book as I believe was originally intended . The books could have been edited extensively and tightened so that Martin 's achieved the same overall effect without making his readers feel strung along and manipulated by having to slog through two books where not much of the story progresses . And that is what I think the majority of the very low ratings are due to . If I had been made to wait multiple years for the publication of DwD I do n't think I could look at it in a very positive light . A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons are the typical middle of a series books where pieces start to fall into place and not a great deal happens . Lots of series I have read have books like these and they always get lower ratings than the beginning and ending books . But where Martin erred big time was in taking so long to write this book and allowing excitement and anticipation to build yearly when he knew what this book was . That sort of build up would be great for the denouement but only breeds resentment when the book was always designed as just a sort of staging for what is to come.So I am giving Martin the benefit of the doubt because his first 3 books were so brilliant and the latter 2 were much better than anything else I have read recently even with their flaws . I think he would be wise to get Book 6 out within two years and to make sure it is fastpaced and ties up some of this one 's overused loose ends . I will definitely read to the conclusion of the series no matter what and no matter when it comes . I think Book 6 will be the make it or break it one for me though . I would much prefer to read what is to come with anticipation and excitement and not out of a sense of duty to see the story to its conclusion . Guess we will have to wait and see . ",3
"As with the other titles in this series this book pulls you in and wont let you go . Superb writing twisting plots wonderful character development . ",4
"I will keep buying and reading . It would be nice if he would n't wait so long to publish the next book . Till then I 'm going to be looking at some of his other books . ",4
"I do n't really care about the majority of the characters introduced in this book preferring the original 3 books characters so I could n't get into it ",2
"I started reading the series after watching the first year of Game of Thrones on HBO . The books were as exciting as the series . I had purchased the four book package and when I finished it there were too many gaps left open with no path for the reader to follow . Mr. Martin explained that there is a book 5 coming that is actually a parallel to book 4 as there was too much information to be presented.I definitely agreed that there were way too many holes and characters that you care about left hanging at the end . So I looked forward to book 5 A Dance with Dragons.I have to say it was one of the worst endings to anything I have ever read . It was like I have to finish this but do n't know where to take it . Let 's just kill off everyone and throw in more people ! . Except all the new characters are so disgusting you ca n't wait for the book to end . Characters that were so important to this series are dead and others that book 4 indicated were killed seem to walk off happily together in book 5.I did see in the HBO Series some movement in the second season that deviated from book 2 . If there is any hope left the producers will save Game of Thrones . If they stay on the path of the books I fear all is lost . Maybe that is what Mr. Martin is trying to convey . ",0
"I 've loved every one of Martin 's preceding books in this series . Unfortunately book five falls short of the excellence we 've come to expect from the author . Reading this book has been like talking to my motherinlaw on the phone . That is to say Martin goes on and on in excruciating detail about people and situations that have no apparent bearing on the real story . This book is a long tedious read . I have yet to finish it and I started it almost two months ago . For an avid reader that should speak volumes ! I hope that he brings the story back around in book six and that it 's not another disappointment . ",1
"This series is brilliant but Mr. Martin appears to have an advanced case of flight of ideas introducing and killing off new characters almost every chapter . This series is brilliant but the author first said he was going to complete it in 5 books then 6 now I read somewhere that he is going to need 7 BOOKS ! ! ! ! Please Sir bring this to a close I 'd like to see a conclusion before I die ! ! ! ",2
"Good book . I ca n't wait to see where he will go with the next book . This book had more character development similar to the last book . You definitely can not get attached to any one character that 's the kiss of death . ",3
"With over 1400 other reviews I do n't see much point in being longwinded . If only Martin felt the same . Another 1000 pages and nothing really happens . Too many characters too little movement too little resolution too little action and I find that I 've really stopped caring . I 'm actually only 23 of the way through the book and I 'm not sure I 'll bother finishing.That 's sad . The first 3 were so good . ",0
"So you feel like the story has failed to advance ? Well I may be young and ignorant of the ways of reviews but what do you want ? Winter is coming and there is a lot of story going on ! Turns out that King 's landing and the Iron Throne is n't the center of the universe after all.We started book 1 believing this was the story of the Starks and the north nearly entirely a feint . We moved along believing this is the story of Westero 's only to find the rest of the world is far more interesting . It turns out old Nan 's stories are true and there are a lifetimes of novels ready to be written about them . I 'd love to see what there is even further east ! The best part about a book is that it does n't have to be all tied up by act 3 to neatly end on time in 2 hours . ",4
"The tale is getting ragged the twists are overplayed and the droning text frequently mistaken for creative prose makes caring for the characters and their causes more than a minor struggle . I might read the next book in the series but only because I stumble across it in the bargain bin . ",1
"I wanted to find out what happened to the characters from the beginning not try and figure out more new characters . This has dragged on way too long and is a big disappointment at best . ",3
"I was only recently introduced to George R.R . Martin by a friend who invited me to sit down and watch the HBO television adaptation of Game of Thrones . After watching that first episode I observed two things . One there is a lot of sex in this show . Two the story was good enough to stand on its own without all the graphic sex . Not that I 'm complaining of course . But when you 've got a story that good on television no less you really start thinking I should read the books.If you have n't read the first four novels of the Saga of A Song of Ice And Fire stop right now and go do that . But if you have read the first four novels get ready for some disappointment . Not in the writing but in the farce that is Westeros and Mereeen.A Dance With Dragons takes us right back to follow some of our favorite characters and as Martin admits himself the timeline of ADWD actually runs concurrently with A Feast For Crows . As with any soap opera mixed with bloody violence bad things keep happening to the good guys . In fact so MANY bad things happen that I 'm beginning to suspect Martin of channeling some inner Charles Dickens . Every fricken time you turn around and think finally ! The good guys are going to start winning ! you turn around and some other awful thing happens to them . There are plots within plots aspects of the story that do n't seem to real contribute to the overall plot arc and then Martin again kills off one of my favorite good characters.That just pisses me off.That said A Dance With Dragons is still a good book but it is n't the best in the series . It moves the plot forward but Arya 's list of aholes who need killing has n't gotten much shorter and frankly there are some other people who need to be added to it . I 'm still waiting for the Frey 's to get their comeuppance as well as for Ramsay the Bastard to have some one gut him skin him and feed his worthless cruel and villainous carcass to his own dogs . Yes . I have some anger management issues.Now I wo n't say who got killed but I will say this House Stark better come back with a fricken vengeance when this is all over . ",2
"Book 5 in a song of ice and fireutterly amazingI can not wait for 6..then i wo n't be able to wait for book 7the battle between light and darkfire and iceis well underway . I have n't enjoyed reading so much since the lord of the rings was new to mekeep at it George ! ",4
"The book was a continuation of the story and it read well but I would like some closure for the characters other than violent death and it would be nice to see some conclusions before Mr. Martin stops writing so we as readers can see his vision for this series . I liked it as I liked the other books ! ",3
"It must be very difficult to write 1000 pages where nothing important happens . Possibly this is why it took 5 years for MARTIN to write the book . Aside from the obvious lack of plotinternal inconsistances are everywhere One of the most obvious is Daenerys'once invincible army is now for no reason powerless . New characters are intoduced by the dozens for no apparent purpose other then filling pages . Old characters you do care about are ignored or killed offagain for no apparent reason other then filling up pages.Every book even those in a series should stand on its own this book does not rise to that level . It is filler plain and simple often well written but filler nonetheles.All and all a disservice to his many readers ",1
"At this point I can not stop reading this series because of the connection Martin is able to create between the reader and his characters but if he continues to dilute the story with new characters and plotlines I may have no choice . ",2
"I if I had to wait six years for this book to come out I probably would have hated it too . I have read all these books together in the past month or so and this was the first book that I actually skimmed through a few chapters . I know Feast for Crows got really mixed reviews but I still highly enjoyed it anyway . But this book actually has a chapter that we 've already read from Crows in here but it 's Jon 's point of view not Sam 's . I thought that was a real waste of space . And I do n't care for Vitarion and I thought there was useless time spent on the Dornish men here . I 've read that Crows and Dragons was originally one book but GRRM broke it up into two planing that Dragons would come out within the year of Crows and it never happened that way because GRRM decided to rewrite Dragons . My feeling is he probably should n't have done that . Oh well . There is usually a dud in every batch . Hopefully the next book does not take any where near as long to come out . I still ca n't wait to read it . ",3
"If you are new to this series a word of advice read the first three and stop . That is where the story really ends after that the genius dies the author is hopelessly lot in the morass and the readers and characters all get sucked down with him.After the first three bookseveryone gradually develops a collective amnesia . They forget their own characters along with just about everything else that ever made them real or interesting . At some point in their past they may have been motivated to seek a goal but what it was why they wanted it how they were going to attain it that has all long been lost . Instead they now wander around forever in their own little circles bogging further and further down with each step . Probably their weariness came from having to endure hearing the entire life story and food preferences of every bit player they encounter in the story . No wait that was me ! I feel so sad writing this because I absolutely loved George Martin 's writing when i first discovered him the Aces series Fevre Dream the first three books in the Thrones i devoured them and counted the days when there would be more . When Feast turned out to be rubbish I thought it an aberration I was more than ready to forgive . I believed his explanation he had so much to say that it was hard to move it all forward . Now that I have read Dance I see it is actually the opposite he has so little to say that he is compelled to add story after story and worthless detail after worthless detail in a vain attempt to find him way back . But with Dance I have to conclude he is lost the characters are lost and reading more is just trampling on their corpses.I wanted to settle in for a good long read to savour each line and lose myself in his world but 1000 pages of nothing was not worth the time lost out of my life . There was one momentary flash of the old storyteller the section describing the greenseers brought hope back for a moment but it was not to be maybe someone else wrote that part for him . Quickly following were jarring contemporary references and constant resorts to laughably vulgar writing . This book is nowhere near Tolkien 's league Harold Robbins and Sidney Sheldon though now that is the right company . ",0
"At the pace he is going he will be dead before winds of whatever comes out . Shame it is a decent story even if he does keep killing off major characters . I am trusting in hbo writers to bring the story home because obviously this guy ca n't ",0
"Bought read and promptly returned . I know it was bad . But in my defense I could n't help it ! The first three books were just so good . Sure Feast of Crows was disappointing but again the first three books were just so good ! So I had to know what happened . I mean GRRM might have turned it all around in this book . Plus it 's well past the midpoint of the series and we should finally be getting some answers or so I thought.Well we did n't . In fact other than some WTF moments the book plods . So I 've decided to give up this series altogether . Do n't get me wrong the actual writing is n't bad if overly repetitive and foodbased but the plot GRRM 's attempts to keep it compelling smack of desperation rather than inspiration . And that 's a huge problem because authors who try to consistently write twists into their books well it only works if they 're truly inspired and the twists flow from the characters and the story itself . The problem with Dragons is that GRRM seems to be trying to create twist plot points by throwing together new plots or characters at the expense of the old and beloved ones.In fact it almost feels as if GRRM got sick of writing the storycharacters he wrote during the first three books and decided to change it up and make it a little unpredictable . Or found something about the original situation did n't work and could n't quite figure out a way to paint himself out of that corner . Unfortunately in trying to solve his problem to put it in tv parlance he jumped the shark.Moreover the way this book developed and the lack of any kind of closure or even move toward closure makes me seriously suspect that he does n't really know how to end this series.Oh well . No hard feelings George . It happens . I get it . I 'm moving on . Maybe IF the series is ever finished and I hear enough glowing reviews from those who had the patience to stick with it I may give it another go . Until then though this whole series gets chucked to the bookcase of shame in my garage . ",1
"Fans have been looking forward to this one for a LONG time . A Dance with Dragons completes the story begun six years ago when A Feast for Crows was published in October 2005 . In Feast fans were given the full story but only for half the characters . Fan favorites like Tyrion Lannister Jon Snow and Daenarys Targaryen were noticeably missing from the chapters of the book . Martin 's nowinfamous claim that Dance would be finished within a year ended up haunting him relentlessly until the day that A Dance with Dragons fell into everyone 's eager hands . A Dance with Dragons not only completes the story of that missing half but also continues the story forward . In fact Dance is the largest book in the series weighing in at 1040 pages.So how does this fifth entry in the Song of Ice and Fire series match up to the rest ? Read on to find out.Note It 's presumed you 've read the series up to the ending of A Feast for Crows so if you have n't do n't read on.The Prologue certainly draws comparisons to that in A Game of Thrones taking place far north of the Wall and giving us glimpses of the White Walkers . This serves to continue the inexorable march of the undead towards the rest of Westeros . Martin is most certainly taking his time drawing out the inevitable confrontation with the Others however and some readers may wonder if he 'll ever be able to complete this saga much less in the two books he claims remain . Nevertheless it 's a promising start to the novel.TYRION LANNISTERFinally after ten long years fans get new Tyrion material . His story begins perfectly in Dance and we see the Imp wallowing in selfpity and taking careless chances his life no longer important to him . It does n't take long for that attitude to change with the help of some unlikely allies and rather unexpected revelations.Tyrion sees his ups and downs in this novel and his luck continues to hold especially near the end . He 's matched up with another dwarf but where this pairing is going is hard to say . Tyrion 's line that he has a heart for cripples bastards and broken things is never so apt as in this novel . His story does wander a bit and he 's not as endearing as in his previous forays but he 's still very much Tyrion Lannister and he entertains us nonetheless.DAENARYS TARGARYENUnfortunately Daenarys Targaryen 's return after a decadelong hiatus does not go as well as the dwarf 's . She is certainly a willful young woman but she borders on annoying and insolent throughout the novel . She seems to disregard every piece of advice her advisers give her always questioning herself but then stubbornly refusing to reconsider . Though she 's the mother of dragons we unfortunately see very little of them until the latter parts of the book which is frustrating considering how integral they seem they must be to the series.There are some truly exciting portions of the novel in this book however One scene in particular seems to be what fans have been waiting for since the moment the dragons were brought to life in the burning embers of Khal Drogo 's funeral pyre . It should bring a chill to readers ' spines and was perfectly writtenleaving the reader wondering about the fate of the character of course.JON SNOWJon arguably has the best plot line in the novel both fleshing out his character further as well as one of the most surprising final chapters of the book . Strange how the Starks all seem to have the best stories.There 's also an early scene where Jon dispenses justice Eddardstyle . It 's an unexpectedly welcome scene not only makes for good reading but also draws the reader back into the story which until then founders a little bit.DAVOS SEAWORTHIn A Feast for Crows we learn that Davos is dead . Since Dance takes place during the same timeframe we get to see his actual situation play out . Without spoiling things let 's just say that Davos ' parts are rather boring most of the time though Martin leaves things sufficiently appropriate for Davos Seaworth.THEON GREYJOYIt 's been 13 years since we last got into the head of Theon Greyjoy all the way back in the second book of the series A Clash of Kings published in 1998 . Martin seemingly killed off the young kraken but readers have heard bits and pieces about him throughout the series . In A Dance with Dragons fans finally learn the fate of Theon . Theon 's storyline is one of the most interesting of the book second only to that of Jon Snow.BRAN STARKBran has a very interesting story in the novel but one that seems to end much too quickly . His almost feels like a dropped story thread and fans will wonder what 's happening with him later in the book without ever finding out . This is presumably one of the characters who will see more time in the next entry in the saga.QUENTIN MARTELLQuentin Martell is the son of the Prince of Dorne and fans are given quite a bit of time with this character . Ultimately his part does n't feel that important to the story and one is left wondering why he is even a part of it . The importance of Dorne 's storyline is becoming more apparent throughout Dance but it still feels like it 's late to the party.ARYA STARKStill very much in Braavos Arya was left blind in her last outing . Hers is one of the most involved stories in all of the Ice and Fire saga and it continues to be no less enveloping in this latest entry . It 's still unclear exactly where her thread is leading her but fans should n't be disappointed by her brief appearances in Dance.VICTARION GREYJOYIt 's not very clear how Victarion will ultimately play into the saga but his parts are not at all dull.JAMIE LANNISTERWhen the book finally catches up to the end of A Feast for Crows readers are reunited with Jamie and his quest to unite the riverlands . He only appears in one chapter in Dance but it 's a fantastic one with a very suitable cliffhanger ending.CERSEI LANNISTERFans will be very pleased with Cersei 's chapters in A Dance with Dragons . The queen has already been brought low and will sink even further before things are through . Fans may even begin to feel sympathy for her in this round though they 'd be hardpressed to ever forgive her . Cersei has been the character that fans love to hate so Dance is all the more shocking for making her seem more human.BRIENNE OF TARTHAnother character that only appears once and not as a viewpoint character . Fans wo n't get a lot of information about what 's been happening with her or what her ultimate fate is but her presence is crucial to the chapter feels unexpected and is perfect.THE RED PRIESTESS MELISANDREReaders are welcomed into the mind of Melisandre for the first time in A Dance with Dragons and given a look at what her plans might be . It 's revealed that she 's not infallible and can doubt herself after all . There are some reasonably surprising events revolving around Melisandre in this novel as well.STANNIS BARATHEONReaders have still not seen events from the viewpoint of the truly legitimate King and after A Dance with Dragons it 's uncertain if it will ever happen . Indeed Stannis has a lot to do in this book with very little to show for it . He appears a few times early in the book then mostly those that surround him allude to him for the remainder . It 's fitting that readers should spend more time with his subjects than with the King himself however.SER BARRISTAN SELMYSelmy is still with Daenarys and serves as the sole member of her Queensguard . Throughout the saga he 's been a bit of a secondary character but with A Dance with Dragons he leapfrogs right into major character status . His parts are interesting treacherous and fitting for the aged knight . Fans will have much more respect for Ser Barristan before the Dance is through.VARYS THE EUNUCHAppears only once and very briefly but is the most shocking and enjoyable chapter in the book.MISSING CHARACTERSUltimately there are a few characters that do not appear in the novel their fate uncertain . Catelyn Stark Rickon Stark Sansa Stark Samwell Tarly Peter Baelish LittlefingerSUMMARYA Dance with Dragons does indeed feel much like A Feast for Crows did though is certainly a better novel it feels dark and gritty . Winter is most certainly coming as evidenced by Martin 's use of the weather throughout the book . Once it snows in King 's Landing it 's quite clear how winter is going to affect events in the series.Once Dance catches up to the ending of Feast things move along a little faster but this book still does n't live up to the greatness of A Clash of Kings and the chaos that was A Storm of Swords . There are moments that drag along and there are characters included that feel unnecessary or confusing . Fortunately Martin moves the story along nicely in this book and it truly feels like there 's an endgame coming though it 's still unclear what exactly that is.The author has stated that there are at least two more books left in the saga currently titled The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring . Though those titles are intriguing A Dream of Spring does n't sound like the title of a book that would wrap up this amazing series . It seems like in a song of Ice and Fire things should end in a blazing inferno and fire should be a part of the title . Mayhaps there will be another entry in the series . Time will tell of course but with the delay between these books growing longer let 's hope not too much time is necessary . ",3
"i was ticked when the 4th book did n't finish the series as promised . I became truly pissed after I read ADWD and found an amazing lack of progress in the story . After coming to Amazon to check on progress hoping against despair that the series might conclude I find that a total of 12 books are expected . I 'm finished with GRRM who can not keep his promises . ",1
"I truely enjoyed this book and I am very much hooked into the story now and can not wait to read the next book . I can understand the frustration some readers feel about this book as it does go back in time from the end of the 4th book . In the version I have been reading the first chapter is a repeat of a chapter in the 4th book . I did groan internally when I started the book and realized we went back in time but decided to give it a try . I 'm glad I did because the chapters in the book helped move the story forward and were intersesting to read . After reading them I think they were important to the story 's development . The only thing I 'm sad about is that I do not have the 6th book yet to read . ",3
"A Song of Fire and Ice is one of the few fantasy series which becomes more enjoyable with each novel released . A Dance with Dragons was a long time coming but the wait was worth it.About half of the main characters were missing from A Feast for Crows so I thought that Dance would show the same period of time from different viewpoints instead of advancing the story . This is not the case.About 14th of Dance overlaps with the previous novel . After that the overall plot advances and takes some interesting turns . Characters absent from Feast such as Jon Snow and Tyrion tell the majority of Dance but Jaime Arya and others also have a few chapters.Martin has not dropped the ball . A Dance with Dragons is just as good as Game of Thrones and even more fun to read . ",4
"I think George is taking his audience for granted . He is n't focused on creating fantastic new books in the series anymore and I think it shows . ",2
"Well there is one first thing to say about this book it is good but not worth all the expectation.It just seems that Mr. Martin spent years writing about all these eventualities of life of the characters . Somehow he lost more time describing interesting situations but less important than the details relevant to the plot.Much of the book is used to describe the world in its details whether with people or places . He lacked however go further in the plot . The drama that takes place in Meereen is a metaphor for all the big process in the writing of this book . As Daenerys has difficulty leaving the place and can never create anything new Martin is lost in the fifth book.Not that Dance with Dragons is bad . It is very good but simply does not meet all the expectations and falls far short of the first three books . ",2
"Title says it all . It took years for this book to come into our hands and it falls short . I guess between his other books he was able to write and his HBO series even George has forgotten his story line . I for one will not wait another 6 years for book Six . Its a shame because this series could grip readers by the throat ! But I ca n't justify the wait or tolerate the authors indifference to his readers . ",1
"After getting hooked on this fantasy series just looking for some closure I was sorely disappointed in this book and the series as a whole . There are few characters for whom we feel some sympathy and I got very tired of the endless torture and gore with no resolution . My ending Dany ends the wars and Jon becomes her husband . The dragons are tamed or banished and the Stark sisters are reunited happily . I will not buy any further episodes . ",1
"It 's amazing how much was written without actually progressing anything to a satisfactory plot point.I 'll admit that at first the series was intriguing and novel in approach but it 's now gone to a point of bloated ridiculous . Too many characters too much focus on things I could n't give two sneezes about all the while seeming to completely blitz over the characters and plots I liked accepting of course that the author did n't kill them first.In truth I 've spent more time thinking about how I 'd have liked the series to this point to be written than finding merit in how it was actually written and prayed for the first time in my known life that the Television adaptation of this now monstrosity severely edits it into something manageable and far more enjoyable for it.I honestly do n't think I 'll buy the next book as much as on a point of principle for how annoyed I am with how this book was written .

"This is the saga that never endsIt just goes on and on my friends.Someone started writing it not knowing what it wasAnd he 'll go right on writing it forever just becauseThis is the saga that never ends ",2
"I am amazed by Martins ' abililty to develope characters that you route for and some of the most dispicable characters ever created in literature . The problem is the use of these characters . The saga continues and more story lines are added to the already over inundated story . Nothing is concluded . I did not feel any closer to resolution after this book than when I began . As I have from the beginning I feel almost beaten up at points . In conclusion with the extraordinary length of this novel I am very disappointed with the result . Unfortunately It is impossible for me to give up on a series one I start . If you do n't have this issue I do n't recommend this book . ",1
"Seriously ? For an author who I thought usurps Tolkien this is a really poor work . Lots of moving pieces around and not much action . The thing that really attracted me about Martin 's first books was the sense of danger the overwhelming fear the classic people are too stupidblind to know when things are about to implode etc . This book was just tiring . Do I recommend you read it ? Yes it 's too important and good still a series to disregard but wow this is really making us work . The last one or two better rock or it 's going to be an incredible disappointment . Little hint George needs to be a little more bloodshed a little more violence a little more revenge a little more tension I ca n't believe I 'm saying this to Tolkien er Martin . ",1
"He has really lost a few steps and I am thinking he really does n't know where he 's going with these characters . That or he just does n't know how to get there . Make us wait five more years for a book and you may as well read it yourself to wait this long for a book I have to force myself to finish is not encouraging at all . ",1
"To be honest it 's more of a 2.5 star book . I honestly think the publisher told Martin look give us SOMETHING ! We 've got the HBO now perfect tiein yada yada . Not his best effort . Clunky and about 300 pages too long . Please do n't just give us a bunch of pages edited into a book . I swear if I hear or read the phrase much and more or one of its permutations one more time I will scream . That phrase appears in the book approximately 8999 times . I am not sure when the next installment will come out . Certainly I wo n't wait another 10 years . At this point I am not even sure I want to read it . ",2
"Not so much a sequel to Storm of Swords . Provides narratives not found in the Storm of Swords in the same time period . ex Tyrion Arya Daenerys Actuallyin hind sight it was a great idea putting these in a book after the fourth as I seriously could have cared less about many of the characters featured in book 4 . Sansa ? Pfft . Cercei ? hey i 'm queen incestuous bitch . Sam was mildly entertaining if it was n't for his 247 bitching and moaning . But Jon Snow Arya Tyrion and Daenerys ? Hell yeah ! ",4
"Love the ongoing saga the rich drama and character development . I hated the tragic ending . I am hoping for a book 6 to see happens to Arya and Dani . ",4
"And the story continues . George manages to once again steal my breath as I read through this book . I wo n't lie one characters fall from grace was the most thrilling bit to read . I enjoyed every single moment of this particular characters misfortune.The only thing I deeply disliked in this book is the fillers . An entire paragraph about nothing of real importance more than once became tiresome . ",2
"13 of the way into the book I realized that the story was going nowhere and Martin just keeps throwing onedimensional characters into the mix to flesh out pages . A MAJOR disappointment I would n't bother buying it . ",1
"No spoilers hereThe books go downhill all the way so do n't expect much of this one . I became a fan with the first and I 'm trying to still be a fan but it 's really hard.Expect each chapter to go into details of superfulous things to be repeatable and worst of all boring . In this last book the author has started to spend a lot of words in useless drama and finishing the chapter when something really happens . Then he skips all the things that happened so you go forward in time to when someone is remembering what happened . Boring and tedious.Another important thing is that the author also goes to the next level in sexual references . And the repetitive use of phrases and words also is tiresome.If you find a book that summirizes this one get it . This book can be made to two pages per chapter easily . The rest is useless and boring boring boring . ",1
"I had never heard of this author and was amazed at the sample so purchased the first 4 . I did n't know at that point that the series did n't end with 4 . I was so caught up in it I could n't stop not much else got done . The nonend irritated me severely but bought book 5 thinking all things would come together . My first thought at the end was WTF ? ? Not only did it not end it did n't get anywhere . Now I 'm pssed at having spent my money on an endless rollercoaster ride and even worse I 'm bored with it . I 'd like to know how it ends but by the time the next book comes out I 'm going to have forgotten half the characters and wo n't care . I 'll save my money & get it from the library . Maybe . ",0
"What can one say ? The work of George R.R . Martin is intriguing engrossing absorbing overwhelming captivating as always . The sheer scope of plot lines geographies characters scopes and ideas is astounding . ",4
"Great book . Have already read it twice . The second time I read it in conjunction with the previous one e.g . read halfway thru Feast for Crows then halfway thru A Dance with Dragon then completed Crows then Dragons . Found out stuff that I missed and enjoyed the whole process so much so that I 've already been thru the series waiting for the next book to be published . ",4
"If you love fantasy and adventure but can handle graphic descriptions of violence gore and sex then you most likely will enjoy this series . ",4
"To preface this review I wanted to inform you that this is a review of the unabridged audiobook version of A Dance With Dragons ADWD . Every word of the book is read to the listener in an unabridged reading with the actor changing his voice slightly for different characters and using a neutral voice for narration . I have listened to all of a A Song Of Ice And Fire ASOIF in audiobook format as I simply do n't have time to sit down and read such lengthy novels . I highly recommend this type of reading for people who have to commute a lot or spend lots of time working with their hands on mindless tasks for me this entails renovating my 1850 home and landscaping the backyard.Not wanting to write a spoiler review let me just say wow I did not see that coming ! I think you will be shocked toward the end of the book I was both saddened and very curious to know more . I ca n't say more than that without spoiling it . A Dance With Dragons is better than night soil ! In regards to how long it took for Martin to write this book I agree with Brent Weeks ' opinion post that George 's readers probably should n't have to wait almost 6 years for the release of a book but on the otherhand I can understand why it would take so long to write a book like ADWD . It seems to me the average author takes one to two years to write a book . ADWD is fully twice the length of the average novel that comes out it is truly epic in both scope and words . In addition George was working on other books in that timeframe as well as dealing with the HBO adaptation of A Game Of Thrones . With these considerations I see how it could take between three and six years to write the sequel or in this case parallel to A Feast For Crows AFFC . Still I just wish it did n't have to take that long . Now that the initial push with HBO is done with all the publicity and now Hollywood behind him and a horde of new fans bugging him I think we can expect to see the next book in the Song coming along within two years but really who am I to say ? All that out of the way now onto the meat of the review . ADWD is an exquisitely written gritty tale peppered throughout with colorful terms such as night soil pulling its readers a little deeper into George 's imagination with every page turned . Simply stated Martin is just an excellent writer and his huge world is highly organized . The scope is vast with so many plotlines sub plotlines and side plotlines keeping the reader entertained and always guessing . His story contains many players both main and side characters and you never really know which ones are going to die next . George revisits some of the characters that we did n't see in AFFC just enough to keep us up to date on what is going on in their lives while he focuses more on other characters and developing their stories more fully . You will find yourself falling in love with characters you hated in previous books and you will despise some characters even more ! George does a great job with getting us to know his characters understand what is in their minds and hearts what motivates them and gets them to do the things they do and even why they repent . It is a joy to watch martin break his characters both mentally and physically as he does it so fantastically . George really knows how to tell a tale and ADWD will leave every epic fantasy reader satisfied that they got their money 's worth.This tale stretches across two continents and really beings to bring the whole story we 've been reading thus far together . And the dragons wow ! These are some ferocious beasts . These creatures are not the little dragonlings that were crawling on Daenerys ' shoulder on the HBO version of A Game Of Thrones . These creatures are huge behemoths that can spout large gouts of flame effortlessly and endlessly to consume their prey and foes . These dragons are nasty nasty creatures there is not much controlling them as they are truly wild beasts.As with the other stories in the Song ADWD does move along rather slowly compared to many other authors out there . You are however rewarded with richer detail but not so much as some authors I 've read who make you want to skip five pages just to find out what is going on . George balances description with plot very well perhaps balanced more on the description side but not too much that he keeps you from wanting to read further . It is a page turner and you wo n't want to put it down.The only true downfall I can put on this book is that it is actually only half of a story . A Feast For Crows and A Dance With Dragons are mostly written parallel to one another as the scope of the series has become so vast Martin simply ca n't capture a section of a timeline in one book . While I knew this before I even started ADWD I ended up missing my favorite characters like Samwell Brienne and of course Jaime . We do catch snippets of them but I miss reading them especially after we 've been waiting more than 5 years . ADWD and AFFC being the whole of a single book also begs the question will ASOIAF be eight books long now previously the series was estimated to be 7 ? George seems to be holding true to his philospohy that evil always triumphs over good chaos over order falsehood over truth and darkness over light . But as always he leaves the door open just a crack so that at the end of this series however long it may be the good guys could still possibly win out and may indeed triumph . But time is running out . Winter is here . It is a fact that can now be seen even on the Dothraki Sea . Are the dragons going to be the power that defeats the mysterious god of ice we 've barely heard mention of ? Who is Varys actually working for ? Lots of questions arise from reading ADWD and hopefully they will begin to be answered in the next book.Recently ADWD was voted on goodreads.com to be the best fantasy novel of the year by readers like you and I . This is definitely deserved . I voted for Patrick Rothfuss ' The Wise Man 's Fear and even after having finished ADWD I would not change my vote . It was a tough year for Pat going against George . I am sure Wise Man would have won had there not been the media hog deservedly so that ADWD has become because of HBO . I 'd bet 80 % of the votes for ADWD would have gone to Rothfuss had ADWD not been in the running putting it probably on the top closely contested with Erin Morgenstern 's breakout novel which is definitely now in my toread list . But those are the breaks they WERE released the same year and even if both ADWD and TWMF are excellent stories deserving of the number one spot there can be only one ! I am very happy to give A Dance With Dragons 5 out of 5 stars ! ",4
"My dear departed brother told me of reading Robert Jordan 's Wheel of Time series . He stated that the series started out with great promise but eventually the later books did nothing to advance the plotline and seemed to be written with the sole purpose of extending the story ad infinitum . Unfortunately the same thing appears to be happening with George Martin 's series . I greatly enjoyed the first couple of books and thankfully did not have to wait six years for volume 5 having been enticed to read the series after watching HBO 's adaptation of the first book . It now seems that Martin has realized that this series is a cash cow and he has no intention of ending it any time soon hence we have a one thousand page book with barely any plot movement . The Others so ominously hovering in the beginning have become almost an afterthought . Were it not for the constant and neverending descriptions of food and clothing everpresent in all the books the length of these thousand page behemoths could have been cut in half . I am slogging my way through Dance With Dragons and the wonder of the early story has significantly worn off . Apparently Martin has decided that this will be the work of his remaining years and intends to squeeze every last dollar from it along with whatever waning interest we readers can still muster . A well written but extreme disappointment . ",2
"You need to finish this before they write a different ending to the book . It will only work if you come up with something . ",4
"There 's a hilarious scene in Michael Chabon'sWonder Boys A Novel in which pothead author Grady Tripp is confronted by his student Hannah Green about his monstrously overdue and overlong manuscript which she is the first person to have read . Tentatively she explains that while the first few hundred pages were amazing he seems to have lost control of the narrative especially when he gets into lengthy side narratives about the histories of ancient ruins and the genealogies of minor characters ' horses . 'Grady ' she said sounding more than a little horrorstruck . 'You have whole chapters that go for thirty and forty pages _with no characters at all_ ! 'Now I do n't know if George R.R . Martin shares Grady Tripps fondness for the good herb but he definitely shares the core symptom of not being able to make his story smaller even when that would make it better . And like Tripp he has an overwhelming fondness for lengthy asides and genealogies of sometimes terrifying detail though none yet for horses thank the Seven.Certainly he remains a productive and very gifted writer . I actually enjoyed A Dance with Dragons more than most reviewers so far . Hence the four stars which I know I 'm going to get reprimanded for despite writing a pretty critical review . But I did enjoy the book ! It 's mostly quite wellwritten and despite the frequent complaint that nothing happens is actually packed with events . There are plenty of exciting scenes some clever plot twists and a few revelations about ancient mysteries and the motivations of certain key players . The chapters set in the North are particularly good and I also liked the Tyrion chapters a lot though I know many other readers did not.The problem is that by the end of the book the reader feels that the series is no closer to a finale than it was at the beginning . This world Martin 's created just seems to get bigger and bigger and bigger and is now firmly in danger of getting too vast for its own good . And Martin overindulges in too many of his own equivalents of the genealogies of horses histories of minor houses squabbles over tracts of land and other details that just do n't command enough of the reader 's emotions.Moreover many of the newer additions to the population of Essos and Westeros are less interesting than the old ones . I speak of course of the teeming host of Meereenese characters who all seem have names like Grover zo Snuffleupagus but whose personalities do not shine through nearly as brightly as their ridiculously colored beards . Martin has an impressive ability to make even his side characters come across as fullyformed people but with this last book it 's pretty clear that he 's hit his limit.The first three books of the A Song of Ice and Fire series are about as good as popular fiction gets whatever the genre . And unlike some I still hold out hope that Martin can turn the tide and give this series the climax and ending it deserves . But to do that he 's going to have to start making his story smaller rather than bigger and that 's going to require some difficult decisions . But to quote Hannah Green in the movie of Wonder Boys that 's what writers do . They make decisions.UPDATE After pondering the book some more and reading some other reviews by people I respect I 've decided to downgrade this one to three stars . I did enjoy the book in its own right and continue to think that the frequent complain that nothing happens is rather ridiculous . But the key problem remains that Martin is not making the difficult decisions needed to bring this series to the lively climax it deserves . And more people are watching now than ever before . He needs to fire his editor and kill or compress about half of his POV characters in order to right the ship and to do those things he 's going to need some friendly but unmerciful feedback . ",2

"My anger with RR Martin will not allow me to give it a 5 . If he does n't hurry up and write I 'm going to lose my mind . Realistically he is becoming somewhat scattered . I was a Tales of Malazan fan the author began telling so many stories that you could n't follow them all and at the end he did n't really answer the questions he developed . I feel like the same is happening here . I hope he narrows his narratives and fleshes out the characters we have now . Still by this book you already know . You also know you are n't going to stop now . ",3
"I 've been a passionate fan of the Song of Ice and Fire series just loved loved loved the first 3 books . When book 4 came out I reread the first three and then dived into the fourth but it did n't quite work for me . I thought that this 5th book the putative second half of the original 4th book might work better . But I did n't reread the entire series and found that I had forgotten too many intricacies and felt like I was a at a party where I had to be reintroduced to all the guests who were all starting to blur and look alike.SPOILERS AHEADIt took me 600 pages till I actually got into the book . That 's just ridiculous I know but there were too many threads I just did n't care about I 'm looking at you Onion Knight I have to say when I found out that Davos would not be killed but instead sent on a mysterious mission I was ready to throw the book away . I was angry that I was continuously set up to expect the worst and then it not happen . No important characters had any natural repercussions to their actions.And it was a square dance I felt like we were just doing same steps again and again . I started skimming through the Tyrion chapters . Tyrion ! My previously favorite character ! I hated the part where he met the dwarfette and performed with her . Just hated the character he was becoming.I liked the last 300 pages but for no other book would I have stuck it out till then . But for all its shortcomings I am hopeful that book 6 if when it arrives will get the plot moving forward again . ",2
"Since English is my second language reading this book was tough but I loved reading it . What made it tough was n't the quality of the writing which is impeccable but the plethora of unnecessary characters that I do n't see advancing the story . The characters that we love are n't in control of their destiny but seem mostly reactive . The miracle is that things seem to be coming together despite of that and the revelations and cliffhangers in this book promise a storm of events that will bring this series to a conclusion . Overall a depressing cynical book that I think could 've rivaled A Storm of Swords if it was combined as originally planned with A Feast for Crows and theiron born+ Quentyn + Briene etc were just removed ",3
"Finally this book pulls together the previous books ! There are so many separate story lines and so many characters that it can be difficult to remember all the back story for each character . However I would say that finally we are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel with a cohesive plot versus random storylines that you ca n't remember . I am looking forward to the next installment . ",4
"This is a series for the patient reader . With books appearing once every five years or so with each book weighing in at over a thousand pages and with the later books in the series trading in plot development for world building only the serious fan will have the strength to keep the faith.Fortunately for me this book did very well in comparison to AFFC . Unfortunately the service manual for my dishwasher would have done very well in comparison to AFFC.Nevertheless the 900+ pages in this book were very easy to read . I actually did n't begin to get annoyed until I was in the last quarter and all of the plot lines were still showing no signs of life . I skimmed the last 100 pages getting more frustrated than ever and almost missed a couple of seasonfinale cliff hangers which unfortunately are losing their impact.As others have said this book suffers from a lack of tighter editing . All the major characters are reduced to meandering through their lives . Daenerys and Jon suffer the most from this treatment but even the Greyjoys and Starks do n't fare much better . The major plotadvancing incidents could be summarized in less than 6 bullet points.It 's a tragedy that this series has devolved from its breathless pacing in the first few books into a walk through waist deep mud . It almost makes me wish I was n't so invested in what 's happening in Westeros.Of course it 's far easier for me to criticize this book than to write something this epic.So I 'll keep the faith and wait for the next installment . Hopefully I 'll even remember enough of the story to enjoy this ride to its conclusion.Happy Reading ! ",2
"Further adventures of the clans vying for the various kingdoms of the world of George R. R. Martin . Twists turns and shocking events keep you guessing . I ca n't wait for the next book . Hurry up George ! ",4
"What the negative and often hilarious reviews of this book failed to capture for me is the fact that I found this much much better than A Feast for Crows . I suppose it 's mainly that Crows was so unrelentingly dark . Plus you had to listen to @ # $ @ # Cersei . Ick . This is less dark with little bits of hope and even the detestable character Reek becomes moderately likable.Spoiler but trying to be vague There are two plot twists midbook where characters who ended Crows badly suddenly get a better deal . Doing the two in sequential chapters was unconvincing . It left me annoyed wondering Is anything else you led us to believe totally wrong George ? Now how many years do we have to wait for the next one ? ",3
"Holy cow ! If George Martin had written the Wizard of oz Scarecrow would have been burned the lion butchered the tin man melted down for scrap and when Dorothy finally got home Auntie Em would be dead on the floor . BUT I love the story certainly not predictable intricate interwoven plot lines fantastic and real characters none perfect some far too real so real their deaths in the story left me grieving and rushing to download the next in the seriessurely at least one of my Stark family will surviveWinter is here ! ",4
"Of course you have to read it . You read the other ones . OF COURSE you have to read it.My favorite characters may be dead missing or enslaved but of course I had to read it . I waited a bloody long time years to sink my teeth in . The only book that took longer was the newest Jean M. Auel book and do n't read that.Was it great literature ? ? Eh . The first book second book and third book rip you to shreds and sew you back up . Even BETTER than Tolkien dare I say it ? The 4th book just hurt me like a punch in the gut and then I had to wait . I had a baby when I started reading these and now she 's nearly 6.This read is a little confusing and as he says it goes back in time but you get serious deja vu . When you finally catch up to Arya and Cersei and a few others again they have small sections maybe 2 chapters each in a book of over 900 pages This would be okay if the other sections were written to be MORE interesting.But mein gott . I can not believe how many horses were eaten because of how many people are stuck in the snow.I like the emergence of some of the wildlings I love Jon Snow and the watch want Tyrion to be king I adore Danaerys but I 'm not a fan of the story as it goes into the slave cities and she sort of pitches her tent and waits for war and disease . I 'm not too interested in Dorne could care less about the Iron Islands and do n't really understand what is going on with Bran and the froggy kids I was really hoping for elves or something and what happens is actually weirder . There are some new characters you might like if you miss Ned Stark like the lord of Griffin 's Roost . And you 'll actually feel sorry for Theon a little.It 's worth a read if you are a hardcore fan . It 's not that enlightening or riveting a book unless you are addicted so if you 're not actually in pain from not reading it ? You can wait to borrow instead of buying it outright . The library wait will be about 2 years so no whining we waited for 5.I really like the maps . I find myself flipping to the map pages to help me visualize where people are . The nonwesteros maps confuse me though I have the hardcover and looking at the valyria page and moving to the slaver bay page it 's hard for me to tell whether you just keep going east . I need a better legend . ",3
"Dear George R. R. MartinI 've recently finished A Dance with Dragons and like the previous books in the series I loved it gritty devious heroic fantastical compelling pageturning crude sexy you get the gist . No one does fantasy quite like you that 's for sure . It was also nice to have Tyrion back in the story as well as Jon Daenerys and the little updates on Bran who I 'm most curious about as well as a host of other great characters . A sign of a truly great fantasy is missing the characters after you finish the book and I miss them dearly . This is why I wanted to write to you.WHEN is the next book coming out ? When you finished A Feast for Crows in 2005 you promised we 'd get our fix of the rest of the characters next year which I took to be 2006 . Well here we are in 2012 and I 've just read it . Now I appreciate it was published in 2011 but I actually waited until the soft copy came out because I 'd waited so long already why rush out to purchase the hard cover version which is physically painful to read ? When I read hard cover books it hurts my wrists holding the big tomes open as well as my body as the sharp corners poke into my skin if reading in bed . Now you are an author of a calibre that I always buy in hard cover pain and all but not for this one maybe for the next ? Depends on when you publish it I suppose.Understand I am not being critical because I appreciate you have been a very busy man creating HBO 's Game of Thrones and well done on that . Not only have you given me an interpretation of the story different to my own imagination and luckily I like your interpretation but you have made fantasy appealing to a much broader demographic than before . This is a wonderful thing for readers of fantasy and I 'm hoping it will create new fantasy writing talent for all of us to enjoy.I am a huge fan of your work and you are definitely one of my favourite fantasy writers . But please all I ask is do n't take too long to publish the next book ? I do n't want to forget the story by the time it comes out as I did with the last one . I actually reread A Feast for Crows to remind myself of the story but I forgot the story before that too One day I 'll have to read them all again.In closing off I felt compelled to ask you on behalf of your adoring fans who have been with you since the beginning please get that next bloody book out ASAP OK ? Have we got a deal ? Keep up the amazing work.PS I get why some of the reviews have been less than satisfied . However I think we 're at a critical point in the story where all of the characters stories need to come together and that is what makes me excited about the next book . I ca n't wait ! ",3
"In my opinion the writing of DwD almost seemed to say These people will take whatever crumbs I toss at them and love it I am GRRM ! To which I say Look you ingrate for YEARS I practically shoved your dang books down the throats of friends family and complete strangers . I defended you whenever anyone complained about the ridiculous length of time between books . I lauded your Seven Kingdoms in all the different kingdoms to which we traveled . I started a SoIaF group that we might discuss this series that we loved . I spent oodles of cash on your books for myself and as gifts for others . I supported your website and listened to your interviews . I convinced people who could n't stand the fantasy genre to read your words . I did all of this and THIS is how you repay me ? By writing a book from which you seemed too far away ? By worshiping at the altar of HBO as your books took a back burner to the series ? By complaining that we who do n't LOVE every word written by your royal hand are sock puppets ? By making it seem like your own importance now outweighs the love of your earliest fans ? Remember us ? We are your earliest fans the people who read your first book then your second etc and it is we who ultimately helped you to this throne on which you currently sit.Like many other reviewers I have read the first four books of the ASoIaF series many times over starting in the late '90 's as I waited for the next book to come out then the next book etc . I happily reread those first three books again ! as I awaited FfC reliving each profound event of the series as if I were discovering it for the first time which speaks to the phenomenal writing of those First Three.When FfC was finally published I was there first thing in the morning waiting impatiently to grab the goods rush home and then to devour the book with glee ! Then when I was finished readingIt was okay But that was acceptable to me the next book was BOUND to be better . It was BOUND to recapture the magic and continue the legacy that GRRM had created . So as MORE YEARS went by I waited impatiently yet again checking his web page for updates like a maniac asking everyone at my local bookstore if they 'd heard anything yet participating in online forums to help pass the time . Until finally finally DwD was released . Once again I was first in line to get the next book of my beloved series . I carted it home and immediately began to read.Two months later I was finished . To be clear I am a very fast reader depending on how much I 'm enjoying the book that I 'm holding . In other words I was so disappointed in DwD that it was almost painful to force myself to finish reading it . I barely recognized many of the characters that I loved and I kept waiting for the story to progress enough to recapture my attention but it was as though GRRM was writing from a far off tower constructed from his overabundance of hubris . I promised myself that I would only write my review after reading it a second time but my bookmark sits idle somewhere around page 400 . I just ca n't finish it this time.So sadly I not only ca n't recommend A Dance with Dragons I also can no longer defend my oncefavorite author . I can only hope that he hears us and goes on a legitimate quest for the magic of the First Three . ",1
"One of the main reasons people will note is that this book took over 7 years to finally put togehter . Whether it was bc GRRM is has the ending created and is trying to see how to create this book and ensure he ends this series in two more.is only a question the man himself can answer . I will say this.overall this book was well worth the wait.Like many of his other novels many characters die or may be dead GRRM is good at making you wonder til the next book comes out that you want to keep around while others stay alive when death is at their doorstep . As many other reeviews have stated the mind of GRRM is a baffling and confusing one but his one saving grace is his ability to capture you in the world of A Song of Ice and Fire and keep you wanting more . I would n't be surprised if after the end if GRRM decides to created prolouges like many other authors to depict what the world was like with dragons or how the other 's were pushed back the first time.If you enjoy Tolkein Dennis L. McKeirnan R.A. Salvatore..you are doing yourself an injustice by not picking up this series and reading it . I have only heard about the HBO remake of the first novel but the accolades that have followed it thus far only prtray what many of us already know..that this is a series that will stand throughout the annals of time as memorable on par with the great Tolkein.For the record this was one of the better books but other characters that wer ehinted as still alive or bounding around in Westeros have not been mentioned for sometime but leave us wondering..what is their role in noting that they still live..will the other come.will the Stormborn ever leash her dragons or will they consume her..and will GRRM simply extinguish the growing flame of victory for the Targereyans or simply allow the StarksSnow to be consumed in an endless winter ? George R.R . MArtin like every other fan of yours is hoping please finish while you still have that spark and imagination in you . Robert Jordan is no longer with us so his Wheel of Time will never be truly finished by its creator . Do n't leave your current and future fans out . I hope you enjoy this book and the overall series as much as I have . ",3
"It satisfys my lust for fantacy . Well written and great story line . Characters are large and real . Home like it should be . ",3
"Here is my advice for enjoying this book skip all the Daenerys chapters in the first half of the book . You wo n't miss much because nothing much happens except not really a spoiler she is indecisive about her reign as queen for chapter after chapter after chapter . Once the Tyrion storyline gets to Mereen start reading the Daenerys chapters because they pick up a bit . The sections about Jon Snow and the Wall suffer from some of the same lack of forward movement . If you are a fan of the Arya storyline as I am you 'll be disappointed there 's not much here though what is here is good . The best storyline is probably Tyrion 's he never disappoints and the chapters about the Greyjoy siblings and the fate of Winterfell are a pleasant surprise I found them boring in past books but they are far more interesting this time around . ",2
"There 's a lot here to savor and enjoy . I liked seeing things pick up from AFFC for example . The Cersei scenes remain my favorite part of this and AFFC so sweet is the comeuppance . And I found myself remembering that Martin is a fine prose stylist whose descriptions resonate and whose dialogue snaps.But we are in the doldrums plotwise as the various threads become too long to spin together . Tyrion seems to go everywhere and arrive nowhere . Daenerys 's thread ends just as she finally does what we 've been waiting for her to do for five books . Bran 's story remains infinitely less interesting than Martin seems to think . And Jon Snow 's thread is massively frustrating.But the biggest problem is the feeling that We Are n't Getting Anywhere . Hopefully Winds of Winter publication date August of 20 ? ? will get this thing moving again . ",2
"I enjoyed this book . It was good to see karma come back on some of the characters . I liked where Bran ended up . Good for him ! Interesting ending . How will book seven conclude ? Will the winter come and darkness fall ? What is up with Stannis ? Lightbringer is bright but without warmth . Is Dany some sort of savior making Stannis the tricksy oblivious antichrist ? He means well . Is his red preistess lady aware or are her fires decieving her ? Will the unending summer come ? Will all the starks be reunited living and dead ? The saga is so bleak and unpredictable . Will we have the traditional happy fantasy ending or will the game continue generation after generation as the gods old and new watch with indifference only halfass interveningif they intervene at all Alas I do not know..As usual it was somewhat tedious and the characters were hard to keep track of but oh well .

"If you like scheming justice complete DISREGARD for justice rooting for and against different characters at different times brutality and the possibility of anyone being able to die at any given time then you 'll love this series . Good luck trying to read this book to fall asleep at night . If you 've already watched the HBO series just remember that NO television depiction has ever come close to fully capturing the books they came from . After you finish this series whenever it ends you 'll be googling books like Game of Thrones to find your next read . ",4

"A Dance with Dragons is the fifth book in George R. R. Martin & # 8217s A Song of Ice and Fire saga & # 8230otherwise known as the Game of Thrones series . Unlike most series novels this one did not come after the fourth book as logic might dictate rather it ran in conjunction with it filling out the story of all those characters who were absent in the fourth installment . At least to a certain point that is . The last three hundred pages give or take a few pulled both novels together picking up the individuals from the fourth and throwing them into the mix.I truly enjoy Martin & # 8217s world and all the twisted greedy and scheming inhabitants in it . While this book follows region to region as the characters continue to plot their way towards the iron throne it leaves the reader with not just one cliffhanger but with many . And numerous unanswered questions that are quite frustrating . Still I must admit there was some satisfaction in witnessing the downfall of certain people and the anguish of losing others.Overall I loved this book and can not wait for the next installment . I am dying to know who will ultimately win the game of thrones . Does anyone know when the sixth book is to be released ? ",4
"Hated this book . Hated this book ! ! But that was only the first time I read it . I thought the editing was heinous where it was present but mostly absent . The plot was stretched over a thousand pages of cheesy travelogue & I hated what had transpired mostly nothing to all my favorite characters . I hated the steps backwards in maturity that many of my favorites seemed to have taken & was straightout bored by others that had kept me intrigued in the series up to now . I frequently wanted to slap GRRM in the same way Joffrey is sometimesbut not often enoughslapped silly in the HBO series for his overuse of the ludicrous term morrow as in on the morrow good morrow etc I detested the late introduction of Aegon & Connington as well.But THEN I reread the book . Line for line and paragraph by paragraph skipping nothing and taking me days and days longer. & I found not only much to appreciate but much to celebrate that I had either skimmed thru overlooked or even ignored the first time through . Jewels like these MANY SPOILERS ! 1 Janos Slynt 's deserved beheadingI think I actually cheered out loud ! 2 Ser Selmy 's handtohand combat in Hizdahr 's chambers with Hizdahr 's guardwho knew the old dude had it in him ? Again found myself huzzahing out loud ! 3 Tormund 's easy banter with Jon Snow & his shining native intelligence virtually unmatched by most of the pretentious lords south of the Wall4 Cersei 's Jane Shoretype Walk of Shame especially when paralleled with her grandfather 's mistress 's Madame Du Barrytype Stripping of Worldly Goods Bestowed & Proper Booting off the Lannister Property once the old man died2 events straight from the history books & borrowed to great effect here5 Moquorro 's fortuitous rescue from the mast of the sinking ship a great visual there and his healing by fire of Victarion 's arm potentially foreshadowing yet another way Jon could be healed as opposed to dyingwargingwightingpulling a Dondarion ? 6 The Ugly Little Girl 's poisoned coin assasinationin addition to the novel excruciatingly descriptive way a selected face adheres to one 's own . Enthralling ! 7 The FreysManderlysBoltons getting cabin fever in the Great Hall at Winterfell & constantly at one another 's throats especially when the offstage murders start in thick & nasty8 Pork Pie served Ser Manderlystyle.might have put me off pot pies forever ! 9 Missandei hearing when no one else does the dragon Viserion scratching himself a cave out of the pyramid wall10 Bran possibly calling to Theon in the Godswood ? 11 Val walking out of the north wood her task for Jon complete Ghost by her side regal & glorious as hell ! 12 Pycelle finally biting the dust after 5 long books wherein he was a constant cringing wormeven excusing his age13 The vivid battle in the Deepmotte woods between the Ironborn & Stannis 's hill tribesfor a few minutes I was n't sure whose side I was actually on & I 'm still sure it was Asha 's ! 14 Davos Seaworth off in search of Rickon on his way to a very bad placeAnd much much more ! I almost forgot Dany 's annoying regressive characterization THIS was the woman who fired life into the dragons ? Tyrion 's mostly pointless adventures which went nowhere the female dwarf is eyerolling in the extreme ! Jon 's constant wrongness when he is trying to make noble decisions & his tasteless demisehow can someone rewrite the Jane Shore history so elegantly and yet fail so miserably at the Ides of March retelling ? the hugelymissed nearabsent Jaime the abysmal drama & death of Quentyn Martell & most of all I nearly forgot the tooconvenient plot device of Aegon the ActuallyAlive & Breathing ! I give this book 4 stars for being HUGELY entertaining & original regarding almost all the side characters but must skip a 5th star for the lack of forward progression & unnecessary regression of the main characters . I am NOT one of you who waited so ungodsly long for this book . however so I understand where you may be particularly disappointed in plot movementparticularly after Book 4 also went nowhere fast . That may be worth a star 's difference right there.Still GRRM can write decidedly well & for the above shining moments & others especially when thinking of the fantasy genre as a whole I come away favorably inclinedafter my 2nd reading !

"I do n't really know what to say about this . I rated it 2 stars because I guess I enjoyed parts of it ? I actually did enjoy Bran 's chapters but there was precious little of that . And I enjoyed Barristan Selmy because it was such a relief to be in his head after so many bleak cruel depraved or hopeless perspectives.The overall feeling is bad though and I feel really bothered and annoyed with the direction of the storyline in almost every specific case . I put it down completely fed up after one of the Asha chapters read a couple of other books and then picked it up again . The author is supposedly realistic in that you know sometimes bad stuff happens and the good guys do n't always win . But this is beyond unrealistic . This is gratuitously dark . And rapey wtf . I do n't even understand at this point how any of these characters managed to be born or any of these long family lines survived long enough for these characters to exist with all the bad things that constantly happen and how evil and rotten 90 % of the people in the world seem to be . I felt really uncomfortable reading a lot of this . Even right from the very prologue I was just sickened . But it really set the tone of the book . So if you start it up and find the prologue offputting keep that in mind . I 'm annoyed with this story annoyed that I 've invested so much in these characters to only watch pointless horrible things happen to everybody . ",1
"I stopped reading Robert Jordan after the sixth book and I really do n't want to do the same with this series . I 'm still planning on reading the next books how many will there be George ? but Martin is falling into the Jordanesque trap of writing longer and longer books in which less and less happens.Despite huge armies amassing this book contains no battles . A few plans are thwarted no goals are truly accomplished and we do n't get detectably closer to the anticipated big showdowns Dany 's dragons returning to conquer Westeros and the fight with the Others at the Wall . There are lots of feasts and descriptions of food . Lots of grisly death . Lots of petty posturing sellswords changing sides Tyrion bumbling and plotting and playing cyvasse.Bran finally reaches his threeeyed crow and learns to see the world through the network of weirwoods with faces but just when that gets interesting about halfway through the book there are no more Bran chapters . We do n't learn anything more about the mysteries of the Wall the Others or the Red God and his priests ' ability to see the future.Cersei is shamed but accomplishes nothing important . Jaime travels a few miles . Arya has some entertaining adventures that fail to reinsert her into any of the major plotlines . Nothing interesting happens in Dorne . The events in the epilogue are not at all unexpected and fail to inspire me to pick up the next book.Martin is often compared to Tolkien and indeed they are both talented writers who have created epic stories set in large diverse and believable worlds . However I enjoyed Tolkien much more and here 's why.1 . Tolkien offers a grand historical perspective and a believable basis for the magic in his books . Martin provides empty history and so far at least fails to explain any of the magic or mysteries in his books.2 . Tolkien provides a clear distinction between good and evil to the point that some consider it a fault . Martin 's world has more shades of gray . That could be a good thing but he needs to stop killing all of the honorable characters and letting all the bad ones live.3 . Tolkien sets a clear final goal destroying the ring and continues to progress toward that goal throughout the three books while telling interesting and entertaining stories along the way . He splits plotlines and rejoins them returning to just two by the end . With Martin 's books progress toward the final battles has stagnated to the point where there is no detectable forward motion and we are at five books already.George is a great writer with a knack for keeping the reader engaged with humor unpredictable turns of events and cliffhanger chapter endings . However in the interest of keeping the story going and eventually reaching a conclusion he needs to move things along draw plotlines back together and refrain from introducing new plotlines for a while . It may be that he has these things planned out already but if the pace does n't accelerate a bit in the next book he may well lose me as a reader . ",1
"Yes I know this is a cheap way to do it but it 's better than cutting and pasting right ? If you read the first four you HAVE to read this one . And you 'll be in line for number six . I promise . D ",4
"This is a hard one to write about.We all wanted it so much . Those of us who read A STORM OF SWORDS in 2000 doubted we 'd ever see A FEAST FOR CROWS and when it finally appeared in 2005 it was n't nearly the banquet everyone wanted . Now nearly six years after that A DANCE WITH DRAGONS arrives . To be honest it would n't be humanly possible for any writer to give Song of Ice and Fire fans all that they crave or even enough to sate them for what could be realistically another fiveyear wait . Any book will fail that task . As does this one even while in some ways it succeeds . Partway through a reread I 'm finding more to enjoy more gems and clues but ultimately it falls short of what I 'd like it to be or would have expected.Unfortunately Mr. Martin set his own bar impossibly high eleven years ago . STORM was and remains riveting moving exhilarating utterly engrossing . I still believe that the second half of its massive text is one of the best reads anywhere anytime . The sweep of characters across continents through court and within themselves never stops moving . It is a masterpiece of huge players on a stage of immense richness and depth.Then came FEAST . So much smaller both in size and character . It had to be the momentum could n't possibly be maintained . While muchmaligned I feel FEAST is better and more purposeful than its detractors would believe . Its smallness paints a picture of what Westeros has become the aftermath of STORM 's turmoil . It felt like a stepping stone a prologue to the next chapter . The calm before the next STORM.DANCE is not that storm . It is however the companion to FEAST which is what it was meant to be . After so many years it is difficult to remember that DANCE is the other half of FEAST the half that couldn'tdid n't come out at the time . It 's not going to be as immersive as STORM was because it was never intended so . DANCE matches FEAST 's smallness by introducing or reintroducing smaller characters and smaller gains . There is no way the Ironborn or various Dornish can hold their own against Tywin Lannister The Hound Varys Beric Dondarrion Lysa Arryn the Band of Brothers the Queen of Thorns Oberyn Martell The Mountain or the Others . The book will feel smaller because its people are smaller . It is a flagstone in a path a setup for the next book . To judge it in this manner is to judge it fairly.So let 's do that . Just because DANCE 's apparent goal is to set things in motion does n't meant it ca n't do so deftly . Two major plotlines emerge in DANCE one in the north and one in the east . While writing the book Mr. Martin spoke frequently of untying the Meereenese knot . Unfortunately he never successfully does so . Admittedly I have never enjoyed Danerys as a character but at least I found her actions to be logical from her standpoint . Meaning that while I may not have agreed with her decisions I understood how she might have made them . Not so in DANCE . As expected DANCE follows several petitionersrivalssuitors as they close in on Meereen . Yet Dany 's actions and attitudes towards them are often confusing and frequently seem to run counter to her supposed ideals and goals . The courses of these suitors are often confusing themselves as they move towards or away from Meereen and Dany without strong reason . The result is a muddle of explanation and motive that never becomes clear and ends with a move that looks promising but also as if the last year may be erased when WINDS appears about as satisfying as This was all a dream resolutions can be . The storyline in the north fares better . At and around the Wall Stannis the Watch and the wildlings dance around Jon Snow new Lord Commander and beset by all . Mr. Martin details Jon 's difficulties well but his forays south to Winterfell and White Harbour are on the skimpy side as is his attention to Bran in the far north.I said this was a difficult one to write about and it is . I find myself asking What DID happen in all those pages ? and it 's not an easy question to answer . Of course there are a few shocking moments and twists a couple extremely so . Yet the boggeddown feeling of the Meereenese knot extends even to characters and places that traditionally have worked well or better than well . Tyrion perhaps the most deeplydrawn of Martin 's characters feels at short shrift in DANCE he does n't have enough to do and what he does do feels halfhearted . Occasionally we get a glimpse of his wit bitterness or tenderness but not for long and not enough . Stannis Arya Melisandre Roose Bolton Jaime and Davos are touched on briefly but never given a chance to truly speak in the way we 're used to hearing them . Cersei has one moving POV that does advance her story and display her character well . Perhaps the bestrendered POV is one of an old character now returned Mr. Martin demonstrates the changes wrought upon the character with the insight and rawness we have come to expect and love . In no other POV are we brought so well into a character 's heart . A hallmark of Mr. Martin 's writing is his ability to create initial shock and lingering sorrow . There is some of that in DANCE but not enough . This is likely its main flaw it holds us at such arm 's length . After STORM 's embrace we ca n't help but feel a little colder.When I saw the first season of The Wire I enjoyed it . But it was n't until the second season that I was blown away . The brilliance of the second season made the skill used in the first season appear as mastery in the way it carefully constructed plot and character . It was as if the first season was only truly there to launch the real story and not be the story itself . My belief or hope is that DANCE and FEAST are similar stones in the path they are the boat and the crew but not the WINDS that move them . Moving them will be a formidable task the crew is enormous and the boat ungainly . Watching their assembly was enjoyable at times but I 'm waiting for the real voyage to start . ",2

"That 's a scary title is n't it ? But the similarity to Jordan 's endless meandering story telling is hard to avoid when one reads this book . Like many of the reviewers I was deeply disappointed in A Dance with Dragons it just goes on and on little happens to really move the story forward a number of favorite characters are missing but after a point who cares ? and yes it was a loong wait for this book which makes everything worse . Poor George Martin I wonder how he feels after reading these fan reviews after being heaped with encomia for so many years by just about everyone . Martin has mentioned recently in a blog posting that he was a friend of Jordan but he must have been aware of how Jordan totally lost control of his material he 's just too good a writer when he 's on his game . Yet he has fallen into the same trap 70 % of the material in Dance could have been edited down or out ok maybe 50 % my main feeling after slogging thru Dance was is this it ? A fellow reader very smart wellread and wellinformed about fantasysf told me he liked it so though it did n't change my opinion made me think I might have a minority view uh no seems like most readers feel the way I do and started writing about it sooner . These negative Amazon postings were quite an eyeopener when I read them months after Dance was published . So sigh what more is there to say ? No doubt it will be years before Martin has a chance to redeem himself with the publication of a fastmoving plotadvancing novel if only he can . He seems like a nice guy wish him well do n't think this was a deliberate makemoremoney ploy but oivey what a misfire this book was . ",1
"I am so excited by this series this book like the previous books in the series was captivating reading the adventure continues with many unexpected events and characters . I so look forward to the next book which I hope is not too far away . ",3
"I will give it 5 stars because the rating system on Amazon was not devised with this kind of experiment in mind . Rating Dance with Dragons would be like rating only one chapter from The Three Musketeers and saying how flawed the novel is because the passage is weaker than the rest . I think Mr. Martin deserves a whole galaxy of stars and I for one will thank him for his labors and wait patiently for the next installment . This said I would give minus 5 stars to Mr. Martin 's publishers . Those people have been getting not fat but obese on royalties from ASOIAF and you 'd think they might use a tiny amount of those profits to pay someone to read and edit Mr. Martin 's text . This is what editors do it 's their job . I have a score of things in mind but I will take only one example in AFFC Sam escorts Maester Aemon and Gilly south . On the way it is borne on him that Gilly 's misery is not the result of seasickness or homesickness but of having had to give up her baby . This was a beautiful use of POV . Things were happening the plot was moving forward slowly admittedly and Mr. Martin saved us a piece of melodramatic narrative by having the truth pieced together retrospectively by a naive unsuspecting narrator . Beautiful . Then comes Dance with Dragon with a Jon chapter plodding over the episode at length telling us nothing we do not know in a much less effective and dramatic way obliterating the sheer elegance of the previous Sam POV . And why ? Because Mr. Martin probably jotted down a storyline in the first place then had the various events told by different narrators played about with the POVs then juggled with chapters and possibly forgot to edit the passage from the Jon POV . But that to my mind was not Mr. Martin 's job . That was the job of an editor one who was not so close to his stuff that he had difficulty stepping back and viewing the architecture of the series from a distance . Editing out the Jon POV was the job of his publishers . Dear Mr. Martin you are my hero I 'm reading A Dance with Dragons and savoring every minute of it but frankly your publishers suck . ",4
"Honestly.not a lot happened in this book . I know it sounds like it but really there were no epic battle scenes.no crazy weddings.no giant feasts . Just a lot of background info and plot building but a lot of it I found very interesting.This book made me want to know more and more about the background of many of the lesser known characters . For instanceI really want to know more about Lyanna Stark now . What was the true nature of the relationship between her and Rhaegar Targaryen ? I also want to know more about Melisandre and her religion.how does it all work ? Where do her powers come from ? I want to know more about the House of Black and White and the ManyFaced God . With this book I read a lot more on the Ice and Fire Wiki that I have with other booksmostly trying to learn more about some of the other characters and the religions.I was really intrigued by what 's happening with Jon Snow and the visions that Melisandre is having about him in the fires . Could he be Azor Ahai and not Stannis ? Could Melisandre 's visions have been read wrong ? There are so many questions surrounding the prophecy Jon parentage and Melisandre 's visions and I for one am DYING to know more about this storyline.I loved the direction that Bran 's character is heading . I think his greenseeing is going to play a huge role in the future of the series . I think through this a lot of questions will be answered and explained.especially since he can see things that happened in the past.While this book might not have been as action packed as some of the others it was still the ` necessary book ' . Since AFFC and ADWD were supposed to be one long book it makes sense that not a lot is happening yet . I really think the next book is going to be epicSee my full review here ",3
"Gets a little long but you are used to that by now . I have loved reading all the books ! Enjoy . ",4
"I have completed all 5 books . I enjoyed reading them a lot . The stories were interesting . There was lots of action and drama some unsavory some honorable characters but it 's all just too much in my opinion . It 's like getting a history of the U.S. with all details from 1650 when all you REALLY want to know about is the civil war and who won . I will read books 6 & 7 if they ever come out . I do n't know if I 'll ever REread them . Tolkien I reread once every couple of years ",2
"I read slowlyto keep the book from ending . The good thing is it did n't ! I 'm so glad the dragons are free even if they are reptiles and therefore no respectors of good or people . ",4
"I 've never much of a fantasy fan beyond Tolkein and the The Once and Future King . But one episode of the series had me hooked and I could n't wait to immerse myself in the books . I raced through the first four then had to wait a good while for this one . But oh my it was certainly worth it.I 've never seen an author who could juggle such a megacast of characters and narrative threads and keep the whole thing comprehensible in drop dead exciting . Not only are the existing characters sent off in some very different directions there a host of new characters and places including one young man who shall remain nameless in this review who has attracted the loyalty of some surprising people and whose plans could be devastating to this entire world from Westeros to the Slave cities to the Wall that is if he can just stay alive that long.I hope I wo n't be a spoiler by saying that this book according to the author is not the last to come in this magnificent series . Part of me was looking forward to closure and the chance to get some longdelayed work done but I must confess to being glad that there will be at least one more chance to immerse myself in this wonderful horribly bloody and richly realized world .

"I love the Game of Thrones series and I only gave this book a 4 because it did n't end like I wanted ! I am not usually a fan of fantasy but this series hooked me in . I hope book 6 comes out soon . ",3
"The man whose voice it is is n't very good . He slurs inflects where he should n't is choppy inconsistent . There are better voiceactors out there . I wish the publisher would have branched out and gotten other narratorsat least have a different narrator per book . I think this one man narrated the entire Game of Thrones series . I 'll slog through because I like Thrones so much but it 's been partially ruined for me by the reader . Where are female narrators ? Oh yeh . Audible broke up the book weirdly . Finding any Game of Thrones chapter is a challenge ANYWAY but Audible contributes to the confusion . For example the chapter I am in is Chapter 34 Bran 3 p 521 UK Paperback . In this Audible book it is Part 3 Chapter 11 . I read alternately the paper book Kindle book and Audible book trying to keep them in sync . Thank you awoiaf.westeros.org for your index.Giving this Audible book only three stars . Underwhelmed . ",2
"This book totally left the reader hanging . I hope another follows and that it is better . The first four books were so engrossing this one was quite disappointing ! ",2
"How could Martin 's editors have let this go into print ? Was he to be paid no matter what drivel he put out . Warning to anyone who has n't read this yet Go back and read the end of Feast and consider that the 'cliff hanger ' end of Martin 's career . Martin put absolutely no thought into this story line if you can even call it that . There simply is no story . I expected more from a person with such a loyal fan base . It just goes to show you that some people simply do n't care about their customers so our only recourse is to give up on his future writings . We have all been had ",0
"This entire series kept my attentionand I was sorry it finished.Butthe author left an opening for the seriesto continueand I hope it does . Well written and interesting . ",3
"George RR Martin does it again . Great book with a fast moving plot . Characters all had significant growth . As with all Martin books some more central characters died . Great read highly recommended . ",4
"If you are like me and love the Song of Ice and Fire series you just have to get this and keep reading . The 4th novel A Feast for Crows was probably my least favorite in the series mostly because the majority of my favorite characters were not in it and because so much happened in the 3rd book that the 4th just seemed slightly boring . George R. R. Martin delivers with A dance with Dragons though . So much happens in this book and some questions are starting to be answered . This is a must read for fantasy lovers and fans of the series . Please feel free to comment with any questions or theories about the series . ",4
"After making it to the end of book 5 I refuse to waste another dollar or minute of my time on this meandering miasma of meaninglessness.Book 1 was of course a pretty good read . By books 2 and 3 I started reading just one sentence per page in some chapters to get through the endless and excessive descriptions . By books 4 and 5 in many chapters I was reading perhaps one sentence every five or ten pages because the story literally moves that slowly.I really do n't know what GRRM hoped to accomplish with the awful books 4 and 5 . As countless other reviewers have pointed out despite their 1700 pages of text pretty much nothing happens except that a character or two that might have been developed in some meaningful way was killed off.There is so much that could have been done but was n't . Sansa and Tyrion could actually have learned something from each other and their marriage might have developed with a little time . Arya was on a roll for the first three books then hit the tar pits of books 4 and 5 . And Jon what a waste.My biggest gripe is GRRM 's proclivity for doing lengthy character developments then abruptly killing the character . I found almost as bad his undeviating use of cliffhanger chapter endings . Obviously it is a pretty standard practice in popular entertainment novels but he manages to make the trite device excruciatingly painful time after time by waiting five or ten chapters or even an entire book to again pick up the story for that character.In short GRRM has squandered in countless ways what could have been an exciting three or four books . Instead he supersized it filled it with bloat and destroyed nearly all forward momentum with hundreds and hundreds of pages of meaningless writing.So I 'm done . I refuse to read any more . ",1
"I say that because this book is just Feast of Crows the Second . It 's very clear that this author has no interest in writing this series any longer the plot fumbles for about 100 pages and then I gave up altogether . I do not know if this was ghost written but it certainly shows that the author will just keep reusing plots for money . Shame on me for buying it without having first read the sample . ",0
"Before this book I really loved Game of Thrones . Why are we still adding more characters ? ? ? ? GRRM seems like he 's losing momentum killing off characters we love and adding ones that do n't add to the story line . Is he writing for the readers or for HBO . ",1
"The latest installment of the Ice and Fire series is as good as the rest.Running in the same time frame as the third books it tells of the rest of the characters Tyrion Jon Bran etcCa n't wait for the next episode of the series . ",3
"This book was too long . Books 4 and 5 share the same timeline and are a poor way to follow the amazing book 3. but if you 're into the series you might as well skim through it . ",2
"I love this series but at book 5 I am thinking get on with it already . Seems the MAIN plot should move along by now . The dragon lady seems to be taking her time getting to the castle do n't you think ? ",2
"I read the first 4 books but have been listening to this audiobook . I love this series by George RR Martin but the reader of the audiobooks leaves much to be desired . Especially annoying is the high nasal voice he gives to all the female characters so that they all sound like illiterate crones . And why did he choose such an odd accent for Tyrion ? In places the reader slurs the names of people and places leaving the listener confused as to who or what is being referred to . Very disappointing . ",2
"I 've spent 5 months reading these books . Each book after the first becomes slow and tedious then bursts into fireworks . The big show in the last two books have not been worth it . We are introduced to too many minor characters and the characters we 've come to know simply disappear Sam for example . These books have become very unsatisfying . I do n't think Martin has a clue as to how he 's going to end this so he 's endlessly dragging it out . ",0
"For starters I was n't one of the fans who waited six years for this book . I got into A Song of Ice and Fire aSoIaF in 2009 and read every book that year . I would say I did n't let the hype and anticipation get to me especially when A Feast For Crow AFFC in my opinion was the weakest entry into the series . It was still good but the limited focus on the Lannister Twins and a slew of unimportant characters shrunk the world of aSoIaF and made the story feel more like a campy soap opera set in the middle ages . The cast of characters got too big and too spread out so it would seem Martin choose a divide and conquer style by devoting many chapters on a few characters as oppose to before when he would advance the plots of many characters all at once because they were clustered to gather in a handful of settings . I expect this trend to continue in the next book until all or most of the players are consolidated on Westeros . I do n't have a qualm with this approach as long the characters are doing things that advances the story and that 's just one of the problems with A Dance with Dragons aDwDThe stars in aDwD are Jon Snow Daenerys Targaryen Dany Tyrion Lannister and a few others I wo n't spoil . Martin knows readers were curious about them were more than upset when such character favorites did n't make it in AFFCread the post script by the author . Martin delivers on the sheer amount of devoted on Jon Dany and Tyrion at 1410 and 12 chapters respectively . Fans rejoice right ? Not quite so . Let 's consider Jon and Dany first then Tyrion.While Jon 's chapter is not as thrilling as it was when wildings and wrights were crashing down on the Night Watch it is still entertaining nonetheless as Jon tries his best to adjust to the leadership role thrust upon as Lord Commander . Jon 's chapter are supposed to parallel Dany 's chapter as they are two young people from great virtually extinct houses trying to lead a people . Comparisons end there for where Jon stumbles Dany flounders.To put it bluntly Dany 's chapters are boring . It 's almost like reading the same chapter 3 or 4 times . The Yunkish slavers test Dany her council quarrel with each other on the best way to handle the Sons of the Harpy and the wise masters . Some advise brute force other advise compromise if not outright submission . Dany chooses the less confrontational approach like taking hostages and hope for the best . The plan fails and we start again . She is provided with an out twice that is leave Meereen for good and head to Westeros she turns down both offers opting for the honorable route and fix the mess she 's caused except she does n't fix anything and her final recourse was a giant step backward in terms of her beliefs and efforts . Oddly enough it is not until she is forcibly remove from Meereen that her subplot actually goes somewhere but that 's towards the end of the book.Last we have Tyrion . While Jon and Dany have always been uncertain about things Tyrion as always been a man of action save a few incidents done in the heat of passion Tyrion is a man of good sense too . Tyrion 's chapter are somewhat of a chore to read . In other books he may pine after Tysha from time to time and have fits of self pity and self loathing in aDwD it 's all the time . He too gets sweep up in the plot restore House Targaryen and finds his way to Meereen to meet the Dragon Queen Dany . His subplot gets derailed as soon as he gets within Meereen 's borders . He looses a sense of himself and becomes complacent with being slave entertainment . He returns to his old schemes when he plans and exit strategy out Meereen . Meereen or what some fans call the Meereenese knot is just terrible for it seems to suck the life out of every character and bring plot advancement to a standstill . ADWD would have been a whole deal better if the chapters about the slave cities were shorter.Despite some of the misgivings I have about the main characters aDwD is a good read.Structurally it could do with some clean up with the syntax and horrid repetition in some parts . Some characters with lesser chapters were googthe character arc for one of them was phenomenal . There is a point of view or maybe two depending on taste that book could have easily did without . In the world of aSoIaF there are two phases buildup and execution . To the dismay of many fans out there aDwD is a buildup book . It starts more new threads than resolves issues brought forth from the previous book . However words are wind . Pick up a copy and judge for yourself . ",2
"After waiting 5 years for this book I really expected better . It 's 1000 pages long but spends much of its page count adrift on a sea of stories that could have been scrapped in favor delivering the book earlier and shorter . The Meereen story is one I would have preferred to see resolved in 50 pages . So too the Stannis story.Instead we got hundreds of pages of Mereen and Stannis and only a few brief drives on the key stories Bran Arya and Dany + dragons . Painful . What 's worse the Jon Snow story foundered making us wait painfully through more hundreds of pages that could easily have been summarized in much less without sacrificing any story integrity.All in all I am disheartened . This book feels rushed kinda weird five years later and I fear GRRM has lost the handle on the story.Here 's hoping The Winds of Winter turns out better and quicker . ",2
"Characters come and go and the only characters I still care about are the Starks of many of whom there seems to be almost no word in the last two books . I thought the third book was starting to slow down the fourth one was just a lot of padding and the fifth one is trying to get started again . Better than the previous one too many words that get nowhere still an interesting read . Let 's hope the next installment will come faster than the five years it took to get this one done . ",2
"It was so slow at the beginning and took a lot to push through but in the second half of the book it picks up and the plot thickens . So stick with it the ending is crazy . ",3
"of course this is yet another great book by a great author this is book 5 of the series and if you have gotten this far you have to read this book.great read ! ",4
"I 've just started to read this and find it as good a read so far as the previous 4 books.More great characters locations and adventures.Looking forward to more about Arya Brienne and Tyrion . ",3
"Much better written than Feast for Crows and provides very interesting storylines for the events transpiring in the North and Essos . Perhaps the greatest detractor was that the Daenerys seemed nearly impotent in her role but we get a couple interesting pointofviews including Victarion Barristan Selmy and Qynten Martel . ",3
"Everyone else has already said it and much better than I could ever write . I 've never been so disappointed in a bookseries as George RR Martin 's . So many strong characters have been lost along with their stories . What a mess . I hope HBO can improve upon these books and give us a successful and satisfactory conclusion . ",0
"From reading the reviews I would guess that some people here would hate Ipad3 just as much no matter how good it is . I love it just as much as the rest of the books . Stop with the bitterness ! ",4
"It reads like one of the weakest books in the WoT series . So much useless detail that does not move the plot forward . Remember when you had a paper that was due in two weeks and you tried and tried to write something and could n't come up with anything . But you put in enough filler that if changed the spacing to 1.5 and picked a different font you would get your minimum 10 pages 8 of which was just restating the question ? Yeah that paper is pretty much this book . ",0
"I have read each installment of this series as it has come out . This is the first one I have refused to finish.Aside from being unnecessarily verbose the story is told from no less than a dozen points of view . There is only enough time to start to get the rhythm of one character 's narrative before the text abruptly jumps tracks to another character . As a result the myriad perspective changes read as nearly frenetic and the flow of the story is quite disjointed . This is more a collection of vignettes than a novel . It almost gives the feeling that Mr. Martin has begun writing specifically for the purpose of an easy conversion to screenplay . ",1
"After a long delay I expected much and more to steal one of Martin 's favorite phrases than I got from the first A Song of Fire and Ice book in over five years . But what I got was like mother 's milk another favorite for those of us who longed for a return to a world we loved and characters that we missed.Longsuffering fans of the series and I count myself among them have been reading this series since the first book A Game of Thrones was published in 1996 . The most recent book prior to this one A Feast for Crows was published in 2005 and that novel is actually only half of A Dance with Dragons . But not the normal half where the first portion chronologically is separated into part one and then the second half or what happens next is put into part two . A Dance with Dragons is actually like Martin took a loaf of bread and sliced it longways making the whole story only coherent when you shuffle A Dance with Dragons together with A Feast for Crows like a deck of cards . The last full book meaning all the characters working through a continuous timeline was published in 2000 . That means that for the last 11 years fans of this series have been waiting for updates on some of these characters . It was not worth the wait.For the last 11 years we 've wondered what happened to Daenerys Targaryen Jon Snow and others and the answers given in this book were less than satisfactory . In fact it had been so long that I had to be reminded who some of these characters were for the story to make sense and in fact the excellent HBO production of A Game of Thrones was instrumental in helping me remember . I see no way that this series can possibly conclude in only two more books because almost nothing happens ! How can we read nearly 1000 pages and there be so little movement ? Martin has been called the American version of J.R.R . Tolkein . That is most certainly not true ! Not just because of the timeliness issues but rather the fact that there is nearly complete moral ambiguity in these novels . At no time are readers clear about who is right or wrong who is evil or good and there is no one to cheer for that actually survives any given book . Tolkien 's The Lord of the Rings had no such issue . Tolkien made it very clear who were on the side of good and who were n't . He also made clear that individual choices had consequences and actions like courage loyalty and truth were to be encouraged and greed lust and dishonesty were to be discouraged . Martin conveys no clear moral compass . And this is a looming failure for this series will we even care who wins the Iron Throne in the end ? The books may seem more like a very very short ride after a long long line at an amusement park but those of us who made the mistake of reading the incredible first three books have no choice but to continue to wait for the series conclusion frustrated but hopeful.Roy Dotrice was a complete failure in the unabridged audiobook version which is what this review is based upon . From the first chapter I wondered whether I would be able to stomach the gruff growling voices that made nearly every character male or female sound like they were angry Irish dwarves . He was great for the narration but the voices were a huge distraction . And it may be because the book was 959 pages long but there were a multitude of uncorrected errors by Dotrice as he would read and realize a moment later that he was doing the wrong voice and switch . Most audiobooks get edited to fix these so I assume the noncorrections are due to length . Finally on the audiobook Martin may not be a good candidate for audio regardless of reader because of his reliance on characters and innerthought in his narrative which makes it tough to tell when listening to a reader when the character is thinking and when they are actually speaking.For those of us who have been hooked for years we had no choice but to devour hungrily like men starved this book . But for those of you have not yet started this ride hold off until or even if Martin finishes this series . Instead look to authors like Brandon Sanderson for excellent fantasy books that actually progress and series that actually end.Review originally published at BookGateway . This book was provided by the publisher as a review copy . ",2
"I started reading the books last summer and was quickly hooked . Im glad I did n't have to wait six years for this one like some people did . Now that I read it I understand why many were disappointed . Its rather a bloated book . For one thing there is way too much description of family shields clothing worn and Westeros history descriptions that if you read the previous four books you already know for the most part . Way too much time was spent describing the various difficulties in traveling yes we get it people get seasick a lot . Is it necessary to describe it each time it happens ? The sections that take place off Westeros included way too many characters to keep track of . I found myself bored often and skimmed most of these sections tho the part where Dany finally gets to fly was breathtaking . I also had trouble with the timeline just how much time has passed here and just how old are some of these leaders ? Are Dany and Jon really only 15 or so ? No wonder things are so screwed up . I did enjoy reading about Bran and Arya but then they were sort of dropped and never heard of again . I loved that Cersei finally gets whats been coming to her for a long time and loved Tyrion as always . But he sorely needed an editor in this book more so than any of his other books in the series . If it had been tighter narrative this easily could have been a 4 star.That all being said this was another page turner . I was hooked from the beginning and while there were some sections I skimmed through the story certainly kept my attention . As usual he is a genius in characer development and in showing the different facets of each character . I also appreciated of the new maps but I wished he had made a character list in abc order instead of by families for easy reference . Hoping the next book happens soon with tying up ",2
"Absolutely love this series ! Ca n't wait for the author to finish the rest and have a resolution to this awesome story . Will be sad once it finally does end tho ",4
"Not as bracing as the previous 4 . I enjoyed it enormously but the edge was just off . There is I hope another book . No5 does not appear to be the end . ",3
"Love the series of the book have read them all a little long in some spots but otherwise a really good read ",4
"I LOVE this series . I wish I would n't have read it so fast ! The TV show is great too but the books are so much better ! ",4
"If you 've enjoyed the first four books you 'll likely enjoy this one . I agree with some folks that there seemed to be a lot of stuff simply not happening . I really did n't like the way things ended up with Jon . I think it took far too long to develop Dany . And I 'm still scratching my head wondering what the hell purpose does Stannis serve ? Seriously either have him do something or do n't waste so many chapters on him.It 's not all bad though and the book is entertaining . It 's not unusual for the books in the middle of a series to become a little stale as the author tries to tie everything together and setup the ending . All the same I 'm looking forward to the next book . ",2
"By far the darkest in the series but like everyone else I am living for book 6 . Martin makes images that live in your mind for a long time . this book is no exception . ",3
"i have read all fo the got books thanks to this product . the dictionary is fabulous . i recomm to all ",4
"Same GRRM while things are stretching out a bit the story is still the same great story that you have come to expect . ",4
"I wanted to love this book I really did . I 've waited 6 years and I reread all four previous books even AFFC in preparation . I need not have bothered . This book was disjointed and disappointing . It started as early as the prologue which has absolutely no link to the rest of the book right down to the epilogue which for some reason introduced a new point of view if not a new character . The rest with the exception of a few very interesting developments felt like filler.Daenerys who has always been one of my favourite characters has no development whatsoever.Jon has great development until he does something so totally against everything else he 's done in the rest of the book that it boggles the mind.Bran is as dull as ever.Cersei and Jaime both have chapters that should IMHO have been left on the editing floor.And on and on andAt this point I ca n't see where the story is going and I 'm not sure GRRM does either . I hope he 's not writing for the TV series as many have suggested but frankly the gratuitous swearing and sex in a series that has never resorted to that in the past kind of feels like he is.I only hope the next installment is the last and that it does not take another 6 years to complete . ",2
"This book had enough bad reviews so what could one more hurt . It was so messed up . It was mostly a rehash of the last book ! ! ! What a rip off . Time had no flow to it at all so how are we suppose to keep caring about any of the characters ? REALLY ! ! ! ! ! ",2
"I just finished A Dance With Dragons and I just finished reading some of the scathing reviews . Did these people read the same book I did ? Sure it is n't as incredible as the first three books in the series but it was better than A Feast For Crows which actually gets better after a second read and head and shoulders above any other fantasy novel produced in the last few years . I do n't understand the critics who say the book does n't go anywhere . It goes everywhere ! The action and storylines move along at a nice pace and there are plenty of cliffhangers to keep readers wanting more . The only parts of the novel that I got a bit tired of were the Daenerys chapters set in Meereen . It 's time to start herding all the main characters towards Westeros . And that 's exactly what I think will be happening in The Winds of Winter . Let 's just hope we do n't have to wait another 6 years . ",3
"I had the luck to be able to read all 5 books in a row . When the author establishes that any of his major characters can be killed at any time makes for thrilling reading . The story is so good you find yourself immersed . ",4
"Too many threads to follow . And I did not like what happened to several key players . But I did finish the book could not walk away from it . ",2
"A Dance with Dragons is the fifth novel in the Song of Ice and Fire series and probably the most eagerlyawaited epic fantasy novels in the recent history of the genre . It may be six years since A Feast for Crows was published but it 's eleven since A Storm of Swords came out and the last time we saw new material from Jon Snow Daenerys Targaryen or Tyrion Lannister the arguable central triptych of characters around whom the whole series rotates . The risk is high that Martin would deliver a novel that fails to meet expectations.Fortunately he succeeds in giving ASoIaF fans a book that is almost everything its predecessor was n't . Whilst Crows was tightlyfocused and constrained in geographic setting Dragons is huge epic and sprawling . The novel covers events happening almost five thousand miles apart from one another with a huge cast of characters old and new . Where there are new characters they are there to serve specific plot points and get the storyline really moving along whilst some major existing characters are simply not featured where they have nothing to contribute to the storyline . Martin employs a fairly strict POV structure this time around Dany Jon and Tyrion and to a lesser extent another character get a significant number of chapters each but everyone else only gets a few . Once their work for the novel is done they 're outta there and other POVs only show up when needed . This gives the novel a busy revolvingdoor feeling at times as characters come in do what needs to be done and then get out and gives some individual storylines and chapters a rather concise focused feel despite this being a huge long book . Certainly with these 'lesser ' POVs there 's little to no time for filler though with some of the bigger POVs there are moments when Martin dwells on a story point a bit too long or delivers bit of background information which whilst intriguing does n't really contribute much to the storyline at hand.It 's a busy book with lots happening possibly more than any other book in the series bar only A Storm of Swords . It 's also the most disparate and the geographic sprawl would make it easy for Martin to lose control of either the timeline or the plot focus . He does n't do either and by the end of the novel the timelines have been pretty much resynched with plenty of AFFC characters reappearing in the final few chapters to keep everything moving . Thematically the book is much concerned with the notion of deeds not words the term Words are wind is oftrepeated probably a little bit too much and the notion that you can only know people by what they do not what they say . Disease and pestilence also play a role whilst for the military engagements Martin expands his influences to include Napoleon 's illfated march into Russia . These scenes are vivid enough to make you feel chilly even if you 're reading the book on the beach.This series is known for its plot twists sudden shocks and major character deaths and Martin does n't stint here . Some twists are genuinely shocking though a couple have some carefullybuiltin getout clauses on the level of the Red Wedding or higher though others are a bit more predictable with the author having taken care to lay some groundwork in earlier novels . Other elements come out of nowhere the resolution of a key major backstory mystery from the very first novel probably not the one you 're thinking of is unexpected in both happening with two books still to go and also in the amount of detail it gives . Another twist is bravely pulled off with almost solely the use of new characters and actually works throwing almost all of the carefullyconstructed fan theories out there for a loop.Characterisation is particularly strong and Martin seems to relish some descriptive passages . A detailed account of the Doom of Valyria quite a few books overdue is spinecrawling and disturbing whilst another one of Martin 's trademark huge feasts may feel overfamiliar right up until you realise what 's really going on at which point a belly laugh is the only possible response.A Dance with Dragons is a bleak book . Winter has fallen in all its fury and it really does n't seem possible for the warravaged Seven Kingdoms to survive with no harvest taken in and little to no supplies put to one side . Some characters are trapped in nightmarish situations whilst others have to be careful with every decision they make lest they trigger chaos and bloodshed . But there are moments of lightness and the feeling that in the darkness there is still hope for these people and their world.Towards the end A Dance with Dragons picks up an irresistible momentum which brings us towards what looks like the biggest convergence in the series to date . But in a misstep that could have been fatal if not handled better we never quite get to that climax which seems to have been mostly delayed to the start of The Winds of Winter . Instead Martin breaks off the book on a series of cliffhangers that dwarf anything seen previously and only a few story threads find any sense of resolution . But we then get a couple of concluding chapters featuring some of the most pivotal and startling moments in the series to date and the real sense that whatever readers think A Song of Ice and Fire is about or how it will end Martin is not necessarily interested in doing the same thing . The ending is impressive despite the cliffhangers but brings in a little note of bitter sweetness waiting a year for The Winds of Winter would be hard enough but the fact that we know we 'll probably have a lot longer is frustrating.A Dance with Dragons solves a lot of the problems experienced in the previous book in the series and brings renewed energy and focus to getting this story towards the endgame . A series of cliffhangers some overused terms though Nuncle only gets one airing thankfully and a feeling that Martin might be revisiting some plot elements a little too freely dent the book 's achievements but a series of emotionally intense and surprising final chapters restore the faith that Martin has regained control of the story.I am a moderator on the Westeros.org website the creator and chief admin of the Game of Thrones Wiki and someone who is mentioned in the acknowledgements of the book . Whilst I have tried to have been as honest as possible in my review you may want to bear those factors in mind . ",4
"Lots of action after the moderate pace & action of Feast For Crows . I was tempted to read both books simultaneously but opted for the original order . Now I join the hordes of readers playing the waiting game for the next book . ",3
"The first three books were page turners and I enjoyed most of the fourth installment . Unfortunately ADWD is somewhat of a bore . The details and numerous characters are fine but the story is told from too many perspectives which waters down the storytelling . Early in the series the original characters were so wellcrafted so real that they really became alive and got under my skin . By this fifth book it seems more like an accounting of everything rather than a story . Nothing really happens . I can honestly say it would n't have taken away much to simply read a synopsis and skip this book altogether . Martin needs to consider how frustrating this is to those who 've read and enjoyed the first books since who else would buy the fifth ? ",1
"I began to get a little weary by book four . But the twists and cliff hangers in this revived me ! ",2
"It is a very good book . I ca n't wait for the next book . It will be interesting to see where Martin goes with the sixth and seventh book . ",4
"This is the greatest series I have ever read . And the show is just as amazing . I can not wait until he releases the next book ! Fantastic gripping could n't put any of them down . ",4
"While I am enjoying the story that GRRM has come up with I just have to ask does this story ever end ? ",4
"Words are wind is a phrase from all of the series books so far and one Mr. Martin should take to heart . I thought Dickens was prolix but at least he was paid by the word . This book and the last are bloated to the point of absurdity and there are now so many characters or perhaps I should say place holders since damn few of them have any characterthat it is hard to keep everybody straight.I do think it 's possible to sell a series of this type without the misogyny sadism homophobia and various names for genitalia that would make a 12 year old snicker at their over use . Their absence along with the loss of most of the pithy sayings would also shorten these tomes by about a fourth . There has been almost no discernable forward movement of the story in these last two books and a lack of focus on the principles who are the only 3 dimensional characters . A Prince shows up and dies but we feel nothing because we neither know nor care about him . I suspect Tyrion will supply Peter Dinkledge with a rich character for several seasons to come but he and the other characters I really care about for the most part I got invested in in the first book and I see too damn little of them here . I want to know more about Ned 's surviving family Jaime the missing direwolf Robert 's bastard Brienne etc . without these bloody ciphers getting in the way.George Lucas should make the big screen versionhe does n't know how to write three dimensional characters either . ",1
"As Brad Pitt might exclaim Is this what you 've been waiting for ? Well is it ? No not really . I have thoroughly come to enjoy the Song of Ice and Fire series but this book follows the trend of the last novel in its inclusion of superfluous narratives and wandering plot lines . I really love some of this book but I do n't love enough of it to justify the parts I feel are wholly unnecessary . When I pick up a book this size and commit many hours of personal time to turn its pages I want the parts to add up to a cohesive whole . This book alas is not as cohesive as the first three novels that got me here . We have two more shots let 's hope two years from now when the next book comes out we will have something to really talk about . And by the way Winter has been coming for a hell of a long time when will it finally get here ? ",2
"After book 4 I thought about not continuing to read this series . Glad I did . Good continuation of the series . Hope it wins the Hugo award for best 2011 novel . ",4
"I read the five books in this series because family members were raving about it . Book Five is much better than Book Four but overall the amount of killing maiming deceiving etc . is too much and frankly it is becoming boring . The Enders series is much better if you 're looking for good fantasy . And of course the Harry Potter series is the best ! ",2
"This is a great read . The book is as exciting as the earlier books in the series . Once opening it you will never be able to put it down . ",4
"How much longer must we anguish until # 6 is out Phenomenal reading ! As soon as you finish the fifth book you want to start the first again.Such dense very wow . ",4
"love this series and ca n't wait for the next installment . The only issue I take with this one and Feast Of Crows is how open ended it is . I would have liked some closure some climax that hinted at direction but I will wait without satisfaction until the next volume . ",3
"So of the 5 books currently in the Song of Ice and Fire series this one was my least favorite . This book takes place at the same time as book 4 A Feast For Crows . While Feast for Crows focused mainly on events in Westeros this book was supposed to focus on Daenerys in Essos and those north of the wall . Yet Bran only gets 3 chapters ? Bran has n't had a very interesting storyline at least compared to some of the other POVs but the 3rd Bran chapter here gets interesting and leaves you with many questions that wo n't get answered until Winds of Winter which George RR Martin prob wo n't release until 2015.The Daenerys chapters seemed stagnant to me once she stopped traveling around and it drove me nuts trying to keep track of characters with crazy names like Hizdahr zo Loraq Reznak mo Reznak and Skahaz mo Kandaq . The most interesting chapters taking place in Essos were n't even Daenerys chapters but chapters of those converging on Mereen.I do n't want to sound too critical because this is still a very good book . And the worst of ASOIAF is still better than most fantasy books out there . I 'm just a harsh judge and I have to rate this book in relation to the other 4 books of the series . That being said I loved the events that went down in Winterfell and the Erie . I liked finally seeing dragons in action . You can see the growth in characters like Sansa and Arya and the decline of characters like Cersei . And with all the major gut wrenching or crazy events of the previous books Beheading of Ned Red Wedding Joffreys Wedding etc I was floored with the gut wrenching event in this book . This one hit me harder than all the others . No spoilers though got ta read it to find out ! ",3
"I have to tell on myself . I did n't realize that George R.R . Martin had planned a longer series that 5 books . When I started A Song of Ice and Fire I was looking forward to a conclusion and all the various story lines finally coming together and answering my questions . About halfway through I started thinking there is no way there can be a satisfactory conclusion in the number of pages left . Then I went to Google and found out there was more to come ! Martin has woven together many strands of color into an entertaining tapestry of an epic tale . I truly do not understand how he does this so successfully.I have enjoyed this entire series . It really helped that I had seen most of the HBO shows . Gave me good mental images of the major players . Does n't mean I did n't sometimes get confused but the Family LinesInformation at the end of each book really help . ",4
"This series will never end . The first book was was a good read but I think a monkey wrote the last couple . You do n't even need to read every chapter he 'll repeat it all in some other chapter anyway . ",0
"This was a gift to my son . He is reading the series and needed this book . He like the book . Delivery was quick . ",2
"Well I am well and truly caught up with the story arc so far and that is satisfying . There is much and more to like here . But on the little and less side I have some quibbles . I have been willing to put up with the lists of names shield devices and sigils I will never remember and the detailing of even the smallest of small clothes in the service of being there . But I ca n't help but be disappointed in the failure to give previously detailed characters the smallest of progression relegating them to the chronic cliche of their theme song I 'm looking at you Princess Shireen and Patches oh oh oh . People with interesting back story and condition who should have had at least one further part to play to justify their existence . And one newish character with whom we spend a lot of time and learn to care about to some extent only to have that time seem pointless in the end . But oh yeah if I am still above the grass when volume 6 comes out I 'll be right there in line.Kudos on the other reviews that point out other unsatisfying aspects . ",3
"5 Years for this pile of c % $ p ? Come on George we expect so much more from youWhere do I start ? The book is too LongThere are too many new characters that quite frankly you simply do n't care about Seriously if I liked Steven Erikson..I would read Steven EricksonAll of the Houses and Lineage I ca n't keep track of all that.The story hardly progressesJon Snow WTF ! The only chapters worth reading are for ReekTheonSigh ",1
"Read all of the books in a few weeks . Right before the third season started our friend loaned us the first two seasons on DVD . I was hooked . Ca n't wait for the next book to come out . ",4
"If you 've read the 4th book you know the first half of this one . Because of the way he wrote the 4th and 5th books it becomes a recap of events that have already happened to the half of the people in the 4th book . However being a fan of the Dragon Queen you do get much more in depth with her tale . Which makes all worth while ",3
"Non spoiler general reviewI was taught in writing classes that there are 3 elements to any story the characters the plot and the place . In a short story you can get away with sacrificing one of the 3 as you do n't have time to flesh them all out . That 's fine for a short story but does n't work in a 900+ page novel let alone a series . But that 's exactly what this book feels like a criticism I see echoed in other reviews here . This is just a collection of short stories without a binding theme to hold them all together.Song of Ice and Fire has great characters a lovely world good writing.and no plot . There is n't even a main character . Ask three people and you 'll get three answers as to who the book is about The writer 's forward states this book is supposed to be taking place simultaneously with the events in A Feast for Crows but that 's just a poor excuse for rehashing the same crap with no direction . He fills in the gaps with tedious descriptions of women 's breasts the last book it was women 's genitals so I suppose that 's an improvement and casual but pointless violence . 1000 pages and I think it covered about 24 hours worth of time . At the rate he 's going the HBO series which is FAR better than the books will have caught up to him and be delayed while he screws around inventing more minor characters while leaving the main players to hand out in limbo.Spoilers belowSansa and Littlefinger do not appear anywhere . Bran has two chapters and now he 's a tree . Scratch another Stark off the list . Rickon is awol from the last book and this one . Who knows are we even caring any longer ? Cersei gets two lame chapters and has been completely destroyed as a believable antagonist . Come to think of it all the women suffer about 50 points of lost IQ but at least I know what all their cup sizes and the colors of their nipples are . Jon previously a candidate for main character gets stabbed 4 times at the end of the book IRL or a decent book he 'd be a goner but since Martin magically brought another Targaryen back to life as well as inventing a new subplot involving Varys I 'm not counting him out yet . Arya gets a measly 23 chapters . The rest of the book ? New minor characters . Like 15 new characters.Do NOT waste your money on this garbage . Check it out from a library like I did . ",1
"Bought for a gift . Have no idea what it is all about . Do n't think it would be my cup of tea as reading material but others must really enjoy it as I was asked for Book 5 in the series . ",2
"I do n't believe the story will ever be finished and I do n't believe any additional books will recapture what made the series so addictive in Books 1 3.I sincerely hope that HBO cuts ties with the book after season 3 the way they did with the Sookie Stackhouse books OR that Martin gives up all together and lets talented ghost writers take the wheel.I 'm kind of glad that the next book probably wo n't be out for six years because it will probably take that long for me to get over my bitterness over the weeks I wasted reading Books 4 and 5 .

"Loved the series overall but this book seem to be different . It was dark and brutal almost all the way through unlike the others books which had more lighter everyday parts . ",3
"I 'm a HUGE fan of this series and have loved racing through all the intrigue and excitement of life in Martin 's worlds . This book seemed much shorter than some others so I was disappointed to be finished so quickly ! I love the story line with all its upsets and victories its characters and their foibles and strengths and the way villains sometimes become my heroes ! I am eagerly if a bit impatiently awaiting the next installment ! ",4
"Were this book written by anyone but GRRM it would be laughed out of the publisher 's office . It has no real plot development . There is no build up of story . No climax . Characters and story arcs are still being introduced in the final chapters It 's just a whole lot of nothing interrupted by main characters dying every now and then for no discernible reason other than GRRM does n't know what to do with them anymore .

"Dreaded the end of the booksince it will be like forever for the next one to come out.but awesome just like the ones before . The man has an incredible imagination . One of my all time favorite . ",4
". . . with everyone who expressed frustration with too many characters and plotlines . While I have enjoyed the overall plotlineparadigmtableauwhatever you want to call it the buffet of storylines started really getting out of control in the fourth book . Ironically Martin somewhat addresses this at the end by assuring all will be made clear in DWD . It did n't take 100 pages to decide that was n't the case . Hopelessly lost and frustrated I just went with it no doubt missing a whole lot because constantly combing through the glossary at the end of the book every three pages was tedious in the extreme . Bigger is not always better . ",1
"I love all of these books that I have read so far ! I was borrowing the paperbacks from my friend but I got this on my kindle for less than $ 3 ! Amazing deal ! ",4
"Mr. Martin we need another book ! ! ",4

"There 's not a whole lot that can be added to Macaroni 's excellent review herehttpwww.amazon.comreviewRQMHSVDEC80QEIn sum without the spoilers a whole lot of wordiness happens but not a lot of actual happening happens . There are also several instances where a character has one or two POV chapters ending in a cliffhanger and then never reappears for the rest of the book . And like all books in the series it ends at a more or less random point without anything being resolved or even any particular cliffhangers for the overall plot . Tremendously unsatisfying . ",1

"Spoiler alert.and descriptions of graphic bodily functions etc . I give it one star as a gracecompared to his other books in this series . But as a stand alone bookit does n't deserve one star at all . ZERO for me.We purchased this book because both my hubby and I enjoyed the series so far . I personally did not like Book 4 however.It has taken me almost 4 months to finish this volume . Why ? Because it is so God awfully MORBID ! GADone would need psychiatric counseling or antidepressants at least to enjoy this book . So I trudged along at about 20 pgs a nightput it asidetried again and again . Hubby kept sayingstick with it it gets better . Well it does n't . Some chapters actually seem like the older volumes . Then the slag begins again . Boring endless new dead end characters pus gore stink monkeys throwing feces vomiting blood burning eyeballs exuding liquids poor Prince Martell . Poor Dany she is vomiting like the rest of them ! I have reached my maximum ability to tolerate realism where Martin is concerned . Does every page every chapter have to have gruesome endlessly detailed morbid descriptions of body functions injuries behaviors murders ? We purchased this book on Amazonand sent it to our vacation destination . What a huge mistake . Do n't read this book if you are looking to relax or have a good time . It will drag you down and poison your days and possibly your dreams.I ca n't see any of this book on movie or TV media . How would it translate ? Good Grief ! I do think RR Martin is a talented writer from his earlier books . But this stuff ? NOPE.it is just sensationalism and depressing . ",0
"I absolutely love these books ! I have not come across anything like it ! It has everything you could want in a book with only a bit a dramatic emphasis lacking . At times the author gets too caught up in details that do not matter at least to me and he starts to lose me for a bit . However he usually grabs me back in quickly . The last two have been riddled with way too much unnecessary info and not enough meat . SPOILERS BELOW so DO NOT READ if you have NOT read or finished this book..SPOILERSPOVCharacters I love the story and the characters as a whole . Character you just adore and ones you love to hate and then those you just are n't so sure of . I enjoy how the author writes the chapters from different character 's points of view but I do n't care for the time in between them or the volume of characters . Too many to keep track of and I start to forget where he last left off with them and this is with me reading the books back to back . I can only imagine how it has been for those that have been on track with the releases.Plot WOW ! I love the suspense of not really knowing what is coming next but the author should tread carefully with this or he will become too unpredictable by half . He adds too much of stuff that does not matter and too little sometimes of stuff that does at least to me . I feel at times the drama is lacking with that Moment nowhere to be found death of Ned Stark and how his family reacted death of Robb & Catelyn and how each family member found out & reacted death of Bran & Rickon . I ca n't quite put my finger on it but for lack of better description I find the author lacking in emotions which I feel you need in order to keep attached to the story . I do n't really need all the detail of guts & gore . Having watched the TV show somewhat helps in the dramatic emphasis department . For example the Red Wedding was more dramatic on screen than how he wrote it . This author is NOT lacking in the imagination department though and I love the mystical magical part of it ! Deathsok as I stated I love the unpredictability of this author and how you never know what is comingHOWEVER if Jon Snow is really dead then I believe he will have become predictable at that point . Can someone other than the honorable Starks die off ? ! Yes a few retched characters have met their demise but not enough in comparison to the good guys . Jon 's death would be the worst thing the author could have happen . Jon is such a wonderful character and he seems way too important to the storyline as a whole that it would be senseless to kill him off . He is by far the best character in the entire series to date . Longclaw would be useless ? The importance of the direwolves would really start to go away . The mystery of who his motherparents are would seem pointless . The Author would lose a lot of credibility with me if he is actually dead . To draw you into a character for so long make him seem so important and then just kill him like that without finishing his story would be a big waste of the story . But alas I do not actually think he is dead . He will remain one of the most important characters to the end . I believe the title of the series A Song of ICE and FIRE is telling.Length of & between the books Length of booksGREAT ! Keep the story coming ! Length between releaseshorrible ! I have just found this story and am now all caught up realizing that I might have to wait a few more years for the next book to come out really ? This will be torture ! BTWfor those of you theorizing that Jon Snow is the son of Lyanna Stark & Rhaegar I love it ! Jon Snow is KEY in this story ! And I LOVE the shows choice of actor to portray him ! Ending DID NOT LIKE the Jon part especially since we have to wait so long to find out his true fate . In general the ending with Danaerys et all was anticlimactic . ",2
"I cant wait to read next book . You will want the next book as soon as your done with this one this book is good tooThe Last Of The Rings . ",3
"First things first there are no spoilers for the fifth book in this review only spoilers from past books.I do understand why some are frustrated by this book it took forever to reach the shelves and once it did it kind of dragged a bit and added a bunch of characters while slowly guiding us towards the finish in this series.Full disclosure I did n't have to wait very long for this book . In fact I did n't wait at allI only picked up reading the series after seeing the show so I had all five books at my disposal right from the start . Perhaps that 's why I 'm not at all disappointed in this book I honestly think it 's the second best one yet Storm of Swords is almost universally considered to be the best and it 's hard to argue it.The cons It does drag on at times and I was always frustrated seeing new characters have chapters when I was only concerned with the main story lines butThe pros Far outweigh the cons those new characters all play pivotal roles and only serve to make things more interesting . After all you 've got to do something to make up for all those characters who were killed off in previous books . Eventually what we 're left with towards the end is the convergence of a handful of different storylines all gaining steam to meet as one in the final two books.These books are all long and you need to be willing to stick through the story . Most people who have read through the whole series twice realize they missed so many interesting things the first time . I do n't have the energy to read through the whole series again any time soon but I loved GRRM 's style of writing the plot and honestly who does n't love reading a book knowing ANYTHING can happen going forward ? Simply put If you 're reading through the series for the first time and you enjoyed the first four books you 're going to love this book . ",4
"SpoilersI agree with most of the complaints about the various storylines not moving forward but the one that bugs me the most was around StannisReek and Winterfell . Stannis ' army spends literally hundreds of pages trapped in the snow trying to get to Winterfell to battle Bolton one of the nastiest characters in fantasy fiction . Does Stannis ever get there do they ever have it out ? Who knows all we get is a cryptic letter from Bolton to Jon Snow to give us a clue which is almost certainly a head fake . This is the big change in the series . The earlier books all took their own sweet time but before the end we had the big climatic battle and we actually got to see it.Still Martin builds a fascinating world and his characters good and bad are almost all interesting . Though I was sad to see Martell fail as he was one of the few characters who was actually proceeding with some kind of specific plan and goal.So I 'll probably keep reading the series assuming I 'm alive when the next book comes out but it 'll be more just to get to the end rather than out of high anticipation .

"Not as good as SOS but much better than Clash of Kings . If I could I would rate this at 3.5 but only 4 is available . After the big letdown of a COK this is a bit of a return to old form . There is way too much time with Dany who is sadly becoming a shadow of her former self gone is the ascertive leader she as been replaced by a moppy mothering indecisive lovestruck bore . But I was happy to see some movement in the Wall storyline and Arya storyline . ",3
"All the momentum that Ice & Fire had at the end of A Clash of Kings has now been sapped from the story . The characters are getting spread so far and thin that I am starting to lose interest . The plot has likewise become too large and thin . I was looking forward to this book moving the serious forward but few questions are addressed almost none are resolved and more are given . Everything is pretty much the same as it was at the end of A Clash of Kings with few major plot developments . When you figure that A Feast for Crows and A Dance With Dragons are essentially one book its hard to believe that so little could get accomplished in over 1500 pages . The characters are already developed and they development little more . No one is moving anywhere to fight or do anything . Out of three thousand pages there are perhaps a half dozen major developments and even those are somewhat minor in the big picture . Basically GRRM 's last 1500 pages in this series equate to approximately half a novel worth of plot and character development . The other 1100 pages or so is just the characters acting in their continually cliche mannerscliche mostly in that we have read hundreds of pages about them and they are already plenty welldevelopedwhile going from point A to point B .

"If you are an avid Game of Thrones fan and having finished the last available book are eagerly awaiting the next in the series do n't expect this book to be as satisfying in the interim . Most of the short stories are good but there is simply too much unnecessary autobiographical fluff from the author about his childhood and his growth in the genre . George R.R . Martin 's writing has grown much richer and deeper than any of these stories although the sparks of creativity and genius are bright even in these earlier works . ",2

"ADWD was merely OK . In my opinion this book lacked focus . There was plenty of ICE and very little fire and a lot of smoke . There are nuggets in this volume that had me thinking Okay now we move forwardbut alas more smoke . The first half of this atrociously long book mirrored the last bookoh Martin actually explains that in A Cavil on Chronology about the dual nature of this tome . Geography is the culpritnot haphazard plotting.That said I still could not say that this book is awfulit provided some interesting meat to several questions about certain characters and total disassembles several others . Martin destabilizes Dany . She moves from strength walked through fire to meekness the walls will protect Meereen . He totally punks Jon Snow . He moves from capable Commander of the Wall to discounting his own advice to himself repeatedly . I did like how Martin delved into Reeks characterfrom a brash young hothead to a meek shell of a Ramsey fan boy who had occasional thoughts that would have required backbone . The rest was in my opinion smoke and cliffhangers . Cliffhangers only serve if we get to see who goes over the cliff in short order . If WOW is as long and bloated as ADWD with page after page ofthis is what we ate and this is how the sea looked or with more insipid phrases like where do whores go ? or you know nothing Jon.. or words are wind I will not scream but skim most judiciously.I 'm still interested enough to read the next installation a copy from the library will do if it does n't take 5 years to be published . Even three years in modern times is way too long for any author to complete a work in a series.In shortdo n't recommend this book to NASCAR fansit 's way to slooooooooooow and has no rhythm and is short on the music of great story tellingcharacter or action driven plot .

I had to reread the first 4 books since I coud n't remember all the story . ",3

Now we 're back to finding out about Bran some more stuff about Arya yay ! and best of all lots about Daenarys Tyrion and Jon . Thankfully there was nothing about Sansa nor Brienne both of whom are nice but both of whom are honestly kind of boring and thankfully little about Cersei ! ! ! Cersei is interestingly warped but I ca n't read 300+ pages about her and by the end of the previous book I wanted to scream . Jaime is n't even interestingly warped his backstory is complicated but in practice he 's just some dude who fed his sister and I really was n't interested in reading 300+ pages of HIM.The book is pretty slow but that 's fine . Some of it I skimmed especially when there were 20 odd page chunks of digressions about the family life philosophy and genealogy of some character I 'd never heard of and was unlikely to hear of again . Let 's be honest about 25 % of the the series is the plain and simple wankery of some guy geeking out on building the arcane details of some imaginary world that any sane editor would redpen . But the rest of it is great and enjoyable . This was a welcome addition to the series . Finally . ",3
"The book is good but its not as good as the others . I think the book lacks a couple of things as compared with the first three books1 . The book is more predictable than the others2 . There is not much suspense in the book to keep you turning the pages3 . The main storylines do not progress as much as I figured they wouldHopefully GRRM will return to form with # 6 and it wo n't take 5 years . However this book is still good but not great like the others ",2
"This book was an epic fail a fantasy Days of Our Lives where the plot moves at a snail 's pace and old familiar characters die off while new ones are introduced exponentially.I wonder if GRRRRM even knows where he is going with this book . This series has become akin to a movie that I heard was good and started off good but turned out to be bad but I just keep watching either because I expect it to get better or I have already invested so much time in it.I can not understand why this would merit 5 stars from anyone other than those making money off of it . To me 5 stars makes it one of the all time best books I have ever read one that I will reread again and again because it is so entertaining one that I think fondly of or causes me to think in new ways or inspires me to change my life . How can this book be any of those things to anyone even to the author ? At most I would think it should get 3 stars but that would only be due to it being part of a larger series . By itself it should get one star if that.The only redeeming feature of the book is the cliffhanger at the end but if that situation turns out bad character dies then my interest in this series as a whole will die along with him .

"I hate you George RR Martin . You are an evil sadistic little man are n't you ? First I had to go through Feast for Crows without my favorite characters . I actually thought they were going to be right around the corner up until the last page when surprise ! I find out they were moved to the next book . Okay . No problem I said . I 'll wait Georgey Porgey . But it better be good.But it was n't . Oh how it was n't . He made this girl cry.There seems to be a huge misconception that this is actually reading material judging by how the average rating is n't 1 star.How does someone start a series so magnificently and then deteriorate so magnificently quickly ? The problem here is that NOT ENOUGH HAPPENS . Phrases are repeated until you want to smash your book or reading device with a hammer . Tyrion keeps taking a piss.SPOILER ALERT ? DOES IT MATTER ? Tyrion spends the entire book just traveling to where Daenerys is . At first you think cool ! Daenerys gets to meet Tyrion ! But then you just forget that that was ever his destination . And Cersei ? I think she got her comeuppance in this book but really all I remember is where do whores go ? You know nothing Jon Snow . I'mma take a piss off the boat now . ",0
"Awesome ! Happy to have finished this series or maybe not ? Good series however and the way the book ends there will be more and soon I hope ! ",4
"Have read the entire series.my only complaint is that I may have to read them all again before the final book comes out because it 's taking so long ! As the sequels progress more fantasy and characters are woven in . Great characters maybe a little too much detail on distant family lines sometimes but still keeps me turning pages ! ",4
"No spoilersPart 1 Halfway ThroughBefore purchasing this book I 'd read a lot of reviews that among other things see below Part 2 stated how agonizingly slow A Dance with Dragons ADWD was and how folks felt cheated out of the thrills they were anticipating due to the deliberate pacing . Well I 'd really enjoyed the previous four books so following minimal internal debate decided to give this one a chance.Scattered among the negative reviews are those wherein folks describe abandoning the book after a few score pages some more some less . About 100 pages in I thought it 'd be appropriate to post an in progress review but am just now getting around to it . At this point I 'm 516 pages in and am enjoying this book just fine . We 'll see how the second half goes.It would be accurate to state that ADWD does not appear to be paced like a graphic novel or anything like one if you want that kind of thing you should pursue a graphic novel . It would also be accurate to say that the amount of detail GRRM layers his writing with creates a richer more immersive reading experience for me anyway . He 's obviously building up to something and I 'm still interested in seeing what that is . For me though the pleasure is in the journey as much as it is in what may be waiting at the end of it.There definitely are a lot of separate threads to keep track of and I 'm not sure how far any single plotline can be advanced until the author starts weaving them together as he 's sure to do eventually . In the meantime I 'm enjoying the trip . Also if it 's been a while since you read the previous books you might want to read through them again or at least the one immediately preceding ADWD before embarking on No . 5.Bottom line is halfway through and it 's a reasonably satisfying read . Have I experienced any hairyanking plot twists or cliffhangers that make me want to scratch out my own eyes ? Not yet and if there are n't any so be it . It is what it is.Will update as appropriate . Enjoy.Part 2 Completed 112611I finished ADWD last night and thinking about it this morning I feel comfortable with a fourstar assessment according to Amazon 4 stars = I like it midway between It 's OK and I love it . That is a totally subjective opinion and has no bearing on those who loved the book or those that could n't stand it . I enjoyed it it 's as simple as that . Having read many reviews before purchasing this book I 'd like to respond to some of the more common critical themes I observed on the boards.I agree with many of the reviewers that particularly compared with the first three books there are not a whole lot of Whoa ! moments in the first half of ADWD though there are some significant developments in the second half . Many have stated that they perceive the book to be slow and I can understand why some would feel that way given the number of different character pointsofview in ADWD and the manner in which they shift chapter by chapter . Would I have enjoyed more focus on certain characters and less on others ? Absolutely but please do n't take that to mean that I was ever bored with what I was reading . This book had the feel of a lengthy middle passage sure enough but one sailed under kindly skies.Another item that seems to be frequently mentioned is that the author spends an inordinate amount of time discussing food clothing and other mundane details . GRRM does spend a few sentences here and there describing what people may be having for breakfast or what they may be dining on at a feast or what they may be wearing . I do n't recall any necessarily superfluous discussions of food or clothing however certainly nothing out of line with what 's been described in the previous four books or in virtually every other book I 've ever read and occasionally just as interesting to read about . If memory serves more time was spent on food in Caleb Carr 's Lazlo Kreitzer books the private dinners at Delmonico 's and the like or in Patrick O'Brian 's AubreyMaturin series see drowned baby or lobscouse . There was one paragraph wherein GRRM described the heraldic devices on display at Castle Black but it did n't seem to be an excessively long paragraph by any measure certainly in the context of a book nearly a thousand pages long . Plus appendices . Like anything else though these things are interpreted subjectively.The author has also been criticized for bringing no resolution to the tale as a whole and for ending ADWD itself with too many cliffhangers . Given the number of years between books and GRRM 's widely varied foci reader anxiety is totally understandable and I 'd likely feel much more strongly about this issue if I 'd started reading the series during the 90s instead of starting in 2009 I 've been able to go from books 15 intermittently wout having to endlessly wait for the next installment . In terms of ADWD I did find that there was appreciable development among most of the primary storylines in this installment . Without giving anything away it 's safe to say that Tyrion Jon Theon and Daenerys are in places very different from where they started ADDWD though it 's true that we have no way of knowing how when or if these storylines will resume . Arya Bran Jaime and Cersei also make appearances though not as frequently as some might wish frankly I 'd be thrilled with a whole book focused exclusively on Patchface oh oh oh . Quite a few readers have suggested that they wo n't continue with the series or that those who have not yet started the series should n't do so until it 's definitively concluded and that 's a decision each reader will have to make . I think everyone hopes it wo n't be too long of a wait until book six comes out.A side note on comments about reader reviews I have noticed that there seems to be a LOT of disdain out there toward positive reviews and reviewers of this book not simple disagreement bitter disdain . People are almost militant about why you MUST NOT enjoy this book . I ca n't understand why people would choose to argue with someone about their totally subjective opinion of a book and I 've not observed this level of disparagement toward differing opinions outside the realm of political discourse . I 'd be interested in knowing what makes ADWD so different from other books in that regard.I 'll wrapup by saying that I 'd recommend ADWD to those who have enjoyed the previous books in the series but they should read the reviews with a critical eye in order to know what one might expect out of the experience . After all is said and done though it 's a book not a way of life . ",3
"I have long been a fan of the series and Martin is a tremendous writer . But MAN why does he inflict this dizzying cast of characters on us and himself . By having so many characters you can only move each one forward a tiny bit per chapter and the net result is a novel of parts too small that move too slow . I would have much rather seen fewer characters achieve more.It seems like this series is stuck . ",2
"I have loved every book in this series but I have to say that A Dance with Dragons is so much better than the previous book ! Fantasy action adventure . It has it all ! Villains getting their comeuppance surprises etc . I would recommend A Dance with Dragons to anyone who has been reading this series . For those of you who have n't been reading these books what are you waiting for ? ? ",4
"I 'm about halfway through this book and I still have no idea where it 's going . It seems to be a series of seemingly unrelated storylines that are moving inexorably and painfully slowly toward some grand conclusion but page after page of somewhat nebulous meandering and backstory can be exhausting . ",2
"I Why GRRM ? Why ? I officially hate this series . Book one was fantastic . It was suspenseful had good characters great plot twists a good Though extremely flawed world and a good storyline . I did n't like book 2 I thought it was boring and drawn out but it was n't a bad book I just did n't like it . Book three is amazing . It 's one of the best fantasy books ever and surpassed by few Particularly Tolkien . Book four was a piece of garbage . I hate to admit it exists . But could book five be the next A Storm Of Swords ? Well it could 've been but it sure as hell is n't . I ca n't decide whether or not I hate A Feast For Crows or A Dance With Dragons more . They are both awful books . I hate to see A Song Of Ice And Fire come to this . Books 13 are amazing . But now it 's a drawn out poorly written piece of crap . ",0
"Book 5 continues the twists & turns & surprises of this serieskeeping me enthralled & looking forward to the next final ? one ! ",4
"My only question is when is R.R . Martin going to put out his next book . A song of Fire and Ice book 5 tied the series together for me . ",4
"I give up . I ca n't even finish reading this because it 's just too painful to experience the disconnect from the previous books in the series . Nothing much seems to happen characters argue and talk and eat and travel . When things do happen they do n't really seem to make sense . Most chapters involving characters from the first three books just do n't ring true in some way.I 'm not completely convinced that GRRM actually wrote the majority of this book . It simply does n't build on what has come before . Old characters spin their wheels while unnecessary new characters pop into existence . The only explanation I can think of is that this book was constructed and edited with future seasons of the TV series in mind.Dance With Dragons feels like it was ghost written by somebody who has no real emotional connection to the old characters . Classic TV plot devices like cliffhangers and reversed deaths are used with abandon . Shocking dramatic events often had a huge emotional impact in the earlier books . But here they just feel like manipulative plot devices for ending a TV episode.It 's really quite shocking just how bad this huge meandering mess of a book is . It 's hard for me to imagine anybody giving it a five star review . But then again I always underestimate the degree to which people become emotionally invested in works of fiction.My advice is to avoid this book . In fact do n't even start the book series if you have n't already . Just enjoy the HBO TV series . The producers on HBO are likely to keep the plot moving along nicely . Also you are guaranteed to get one new season per year for as long as it runs . In contrast the book series has jumped the rails hurtled down the ravine and crashed into a great steaming mass of debris . ",0
"George had what sounded like a great idea Divide a story that had run too long in half with some characters in the fourth book and another half in the 5th book . The Fourth book was one of the hardest to read . I love this saga and HBO has done a very good job of not rewriting Mr. Martin 's work . The fifth book is uneven but I still give it four stars . I look forward to seeing how the Game of Thrones plays out . I think Mr. Martin may end up being our century 's Tolkien . ",3
"I love This series so much . George R.R . martin is just an amazing writer and I have a great deal of respect for his obvious passion for detail and creation of substantive charterers.That said I was somewhat disappoint by A dance with dragons . After several years of waiting after having left off on several cliff hangers I was hoping that this volume would make the wait so worth it and I was so thrilled to get my copy.Sadly that was n't the case.without giving away any spoilers not that there were many to be honest . the book was a slow ambling drag that teased at upcoming moments of excitement and revelation but never actually got to any.It may as well have been a travelogue since all the characters mainly did was tour the scenery and wait around a lot.It 's sad cause the others in the series I would have to force myself to put the book down and go to bed . This one actually put me to sleep and I had to force myself to keep plodding through it to the end.around page 500 I stopped expecting the story lines to progress and began to accept this book was not going anywhere . It was like someone took a movies broll and used it as filler to make a faux sequel to cash in on a franchise.I 'm so disappointed.I do n't know if Mr. Martin is just tired of the series and gave up or if he just is n't sure what to do next so he kept typing words until he reached the word count cut off point.I honestly do n't know if I have another 5 year wait in me so I think from now on I 'll just watch the HBO show and leave off on the books.Anyone know of any good series I can replace this one with ? I 'm open to suggestions . ",0
"After reading all the current Fire and Ice books I think that A Dance with Dragons was the most exciting of the series . I am waiting for the next book in the series ",4
"This is another great book from George R Martin . I simply can not wait for winds of winter ! ! The show will have to hold me over for now ",4
"Game of Thrones is one of the rare instances where the movieTV show is MUCH better than the book . The HBO series trims out all the bloated boring aimless overly detailed fat from book . The show is awesome . Skip the books especially this 5th one . Dance with Dragons is so painful and boring it is just not worth it when you will be able to watch the show instead . ",0
"Received this book when expected as always from Amazon . Pretty much what you expect from George Martin except hes still killing off characters at an alarming rate . Kept my interest all the way thru and this is a very long story . I cant wait for the next one . Hopefully in the near future . He is an extremely slow writer . ",4
"Full of surprises per usual but still a transition book as 'Crows ' had been . Gets a little muddled with the addition of so many characters and the main and beloved ones get jumbled in there unfortunately . Great set up as the last had been still waiting for a climax and resolution though ! ",3
"5 's for this whole series ! BUTGeorge where the hell is Winds Of Winter ? And how could you do it George ? How could you let HBO utterly ruin this unmatched grand epic ? StopIntervene nowbefore they bring you past that monitarilyblurring point of no return . Do n't look back through all the $ $ 's they used to cause you to take your eye off the ball ! ",4
"About halfway thru this thing and story focuses on Tyrion Lannister . Not much else . The whole series is losing steam for me and has become more of guilty pleasure with all of the plotting scheming and TALKING ! Toooooo much like a midevil soap opera . Very little action and plot progression with a final conclusionconfrontation in site . Hopefully HBO wo n't make the same mistake with their interpretation . Still like the premise and characters but my interest is waning . I 'm just along for the ride now on autopilot . No longer salivating for the next chapter . I think this book could have been summarized into four to six chapters . But like I said earlier halfway thru . Mr. Martin sometimes has that trick with making his endings shocking but satisfying cliff hangers . ",2
"A lot of the reviews that have been negative so far for Dance talk about how the wait was n't worth it . But the thing is for the most part these reviews only harp on the fact that oh I 've waited six years for Martin to finally finish it but there 's no epic battlesresolutionrevelations etcetera and I waited so long for THIS ? Oh man I 'm done with the series blah blah blah . They do n't actually talk about the story itself . And while I 'm as critical of Martin for how absurdly long he makes his loyal readers wait between installmentsespecially since the argument could be made that a part of that wait is spent by him not spending as much time on writing as fans think he shouldthis is n't the place for those arguments . A book should be judged by its contents not how long a reader waited for it.These people while not completely unjustified in a lot of the criticisms they 're raisingespecially in the abundance of cliff hangers and openended storylines are missing the point of what in my mind makes A Song of Ice and Fire greatthe characters the unpredictable nature of where the plot 's going to go the wonderful world of Westeros and its environs but again most of all the characters ! Dance is much more about character development than other books in Martin 's series especially compared to Storm of Swords in which almost every chapter involved some great action scene or development or advancement of the plot in some way.The pace here is more like that of Clash of Kingsand much better not just barely better than Feast which I think most will agree is the most slowpaced novel in the series . While it lacked epic scenes equivalent to the Battle of Blackwater the wildlings ' attack on the wall or the Red Wedding there 's still plenty of solid content that should satiate most fans of the series particularly the introduction of a storylinegroup of characters that pretty much changes everything and one cliffhanger for a certain character that I had to reread again it was so exciting and unexpected.Again its the characterization and not the war or overarching storyline that 's the star of the show here . The POVs are essentially divided into three groups those in the North and around the Wall reacting to the events of Mance Rayder 's failed attack on the wall and Roose Bolton 's rise to Warden of the North Dany as she attempts to establish her role as Meereen 's monarch and the various suitors and others attempting to reach her and her dragons and a smattering of returning POVs from Feast for Crows which while not completely resolving loose ends from the previous novel do just enough to tie up those loose ends but leave the reader intrigued as to what happens next.The three main POVs are easily the most slowly paced but they also have in my mind some of the best character development in the series . Jon is struggling to remain neutral in Stannis ' efforts to win the north while at the same time asserting himself as a strong commander . Tyrion has decided to embrace the image of the evil imp everyone else had wrongly made him out to be while trying to decide what to do with his life . And Dany makes decisions in her ruling of Meereen that may or not go against the destiny meant for her.I enjoyed the other POVs more than I did the main ones but really all of them set the stage for what will hopefully be a brilliant next installmentwhenever that may be . The new POVs there are fourtwo are brand new characters and two are former periphery charactersare more or less welcome additions to the story especially one of the new ones . Finally Dance easily has the best oneshot POV meaning prologue or epilogue of the series so far.And the book is n't just nothing happening until the end as some are making it out to bethere is a HUGE revelation early onnot to mention another towards the end careless readers will miss and one of the main POVs comes out of the gate really strong in a moment that had me cheering when I read it.No it is n't perfect . But Martin ca n't make every installment of the series Storm of Swords or of its same exact caliber.Complaints for me include that while cliffhangers are n't necessarily a bad thing and some of them are excellent in this others just left me going really ? That 's all we get ? Martin definitely overuses his techniques of repeating phrases and describing food and fauna in a ton of detail . And while I enjoyed most of the POVs I had a problem with two of the new onesone only got one chapter and the other who was foreshadowed in the previous novel just never became fully realized for me.But hey at the end of the day I got to be reunited with Jon Dany Tyrion Bran Davos and other characters we have n't seen in years . And while there may not be a slambang epic beheading battle or wedding people may have wanted as a reward for their long wait there is still plenty of developments and plenty of foreshadowing at things to come that should leave most fans at least somewhat happy or at the very least talking about and debating the events of Dance .

"There is a reason that 40 % of reviews of ADWD are 1 or 2 stars . As good as A Game of Thrones is wonderful this book is so uninteresting that I could n't wait to stop reading it picking it up now and then like any addict hoping for a fix that never comes or satisfies . The trajectory of this series is much like that of free falling object . If the first couple of books had n't sucked me in I 'd have stopped reading this one in the middle much like I was quick to jettison Robert Jordan 's Wheel of Time which at least kept my interest for 5 books . This much I know If Martin who is as far from being an American Tolkien as the nearest blackhole is from earth doest wrap this abomination up in book six I wo n't even bother to finish . I ca n't imagine that Martin in his heart of hearts truly believes this work comes within light years of approaching A Game of Thrones . Maybe we are expecting too much and Martin is just another one hit wonder . You ca n't help but wonder if he is dragging this out for the money . ",0
"I have read all the books but wanted to have them all in my Kindle library . I will read all five again before reading the 6th book when it arrives . These books have so many subplots it 's hard to keep track of them all with only one reading . ",4
"No spoiler that 's all I 'll say about the ending . Very annoyed that I could n't diver right into the next one as it 's killing me to know what happeneds . I like this series a lot and I 'm very much looking forward to continuing to explore and discover this story . ",3
"Do n't subscribe to your reviews people ca n't help but show their ass on the internet.I loved this book . You did n't ? Too bad so sad . Go troll somewhere else . ",4
"I hunkered down and read Dance with Dragons having read the previous four in the series . Ended up skimming the whole thing and even that was a waste of my time . All the really good characters are left unresolved for the most part . Dumbest thing ever . Really really really frustrating and disappointing . I ca n't recall being so completely disgusted with a book and an author . ",0
"I have gone through five looong books and I am left with anticipation and anxiety while RR is pumping out other books . Take me back to Westeros and let me live among the Wildings ! ",4
"Mr. Martin continues to keep us guessing as to who will survive and who will perish . The characters are imbued with humanity as well as cruelty yet we are constantly cheering them on . The backdrop is visceral and entirely real . It makes the television Survivor episodes seem like a cookie bake for the Girl Scouts . As an avid follower I am very much looking forward to the next book . I 'm sure that it will be much and more . ",4
"A long book that really did n't take me anywhere the 4th book did . It 's about time to end some of the storylines and put this series to bed . ",2
"I discovered this series a little more than a year ago and therefore was able to read them in order with barely a break in between.Book four and five was not quite as much to my liking as the prior 3 . Primarily because of the format he chose of going back and forth and back and forth between characters with book 5 taking place at the same time as book 4 . This I found a bit off putting though not exactly sure why . Still as always a great tale and should be read vs viewed . ",3
"Remember when you were a kid in school and were forced to read some incredibly boring book because it was a 'classic ' ? And remember how you ploughed your way through it wishing that something anything would happen to relieve the tedium of reading long winded exposition description and dialogue ? Well I 'm sorry to say that at times I found myself thinking the same thing about A Dance With Dragons as I did about Silas Marner . Not all the time and certainly not enough to make me want to throw the book to the floor screaming enough ! . but sometimes.Do n't get me wrong Mr Martin can write and there were occasions when I was genuinely astonished and surprised by events but not nearly often enough in a book of this length.It almost seems as if the author was n't quite sure where he was heading with his story or as if he got lost and meandered around for several thousand words before he got himself back on track.All of my favourite characters were there but some of the people just seemed to disappear completely and some only made brief and very frustrating cameo appearances.I 'm enjoying the Arya arc and looking forward to seeing what the next book has in store for her but judging from how some characters are treated in this book there is a possibility that she may completely disappear never to be heard from again.Tyrian has been placed on a stationary bicycle throughout the book he 's pedaling very slowly and getting nowhere . Dany has changed from the mother of dragons who won the heart of Khal Drogo to a lovesick girl ruled by her hormones and damn the consequences . And poor Jon Snow well he 's spent so much time on the Wall waiting for winter that he must be freezing to death.And Cliffhangers ? ? they may be acceptable plot devices in TV shows or even films but must we wait another 6 years to find out if ' ' is really dead ? Unbelievable.Note to Mr Martin I 'm no spring chicken and at this rate I may not live long enough to read the end of the story so please write faster and cut down a little on the length my husband grew tired of letting me prop the book up against his back .

"I loved it ! This book tied up many loose ends from the last book ! But the only thing that I can tell you that you will be shocked towards the end ! That 's all ! ",4
"Personally I 'm okay with soaking up GRRM 's worldbuilding and enjoying the journey . The quality of GRRM 's writing was as good in books 4 & 5 as it was in 13 the only difference was that a lot of the scenes seemed to create more questions than answers . A Dance with Dragons was filled with character development and assuming GRRM is going to tie up all loose ends in books 6 & 7 this is a 5star book . ",4
"I know that Book 4 k in this series was a bridge book but I was sort of discouraged and hesitated to start reading 5 . It is as exciting as book 3 in the series . I know when I hit the end of this I will be on pins and needles waiting for Book 6 to be published . There is just one surprise after the other and I am not giving out any spoiler hints . It was way too much fun reading something and going WHAT ! ",3
"Ugh long sections of landscape details with no point lots of really really minor characters tediously described . Virtually nothing in the way of advancing the plot . Tiresome descriptions of pus blood and wounds ad nauseum . Only there for shock value . I loved the first 3 books . 4 and 5 are just plain boring . Wo n't be buying anymore of this series . ",0
"I had almost decided to give up on this series because it has been so long since Feast for Crows came out but then HBO did Game of Thrones and I remembered why I loved them so much.The book has some predictable flaws the foremost of which was created by dividing the book into Feast for Crows and Dance with Dragons . If they had come out more swiftly Martin might have gotten away with writing such an unwieldy set of books . But it is just too hard to remember who many of the characters are . You spend quite a bit of time going who the hell is this guy ? To my surprise however I found myself missing some of the people who I had thought I would n't Brianna . And most of the time I did n't much mind if it took me a while to place characters or if I had to go look them up online.I was enjoying the journey . So Martin painted himself into some big writerly corners . Big deal . It 's a complicated world he has created and I 'm going to stick around until I find out the ultimate fate of Tyrion Lannister unless I meet my own first . Which is entirely possible given how long it takes Martin to write these things . ",3
"As much as I loved A Game of Thrones liked A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords I disliked this book Also hated A Feast for Crows . Selfindulgent wandering purple prose going nowhere a total waste of time . If you 're hoping for some resolution for the characters you 've grown to love and hate forget it . They are all just left in limbo . Martin should have stopped while he was ahead because this definitely left a bad taste a feeling he just spewed it out to make some more money . ",0
"It is not that all of the criticisms in the posted reviews are erroneous it is just that this installment and the over arching story of the series are utterly amazing notwithstanding the validity of some of those criticisms . Yes the storyline is highly complex and has innumerable characters . Yes I am concerned that I might die or more likely that Martin might die before the whole series is completed . Yes the wait for the next installment is likely to be insufferable . And yes to a whole host of similar criticims . SPOILER ALERT But at the end of the day none of that seems to matter when Daenerys after almost 5 full volumes of anticipation mounts Drogon and rides him out of the fighting pits . That scene and probably another 20 stunning scenes in the book make me not care an iota about all of the other issues . This is grand saga storytelling of the highest order . If Homer were alive he 'd be impressed . ",4
"I 'm one of those people who can often see what 's coming in books TV shows or movies but not here ! Even in the 5th book Martin 's series still manages to shock me . I love it . ",4
"Much has been made about the nearly sixyear void since George R.R . Martin dropped A FEAST FOR CROWS into our laps . Impatient readers were up in arms as other books hit the shelves with Martin 's name splashed across the cover and yet the eagerly awaited fifth installment of the immensely intriguing A Song of Ice and Fire seemed no closer to completion . At one point Martin refused to discuss the book anymore and more recently fellow authors Neil Gaiman and John Scalzi jumped to defend Martin against the ire of fans the former bluntly intimating that Martin does n't owe anyone anything and the latter logically laying out the facts that given the size of the book it was just necessarily going to take as long as it did . Weighing in at 1016 pages A DANCE WITH DRAGONS seriously could not have been written any faster . Now that the results of all those long agonizing years of waiting are finally revealed it goes without saying that cover to cover page for page it was absolutely worth it.A DANCE WITH DRAGONS is not a direct sequel to A FEAST FOR CROWS . Originally the two books were one but it was decided that the most logical way to split the book would be along character lines . Instead of telling half the story for all the characters the full story was told for half the characters in each book . Approximately 23 of the way through DANCE however the storylines converge once more and the combined storyline resumes.Martin spins his story like a spider spins a web . Each chapter is from one character 's point of view comprising the rings of the web . But moments exist when a strand a main arc runs across all the rings connecting the storylines to the larger core plot . So as one reads they will essentially be jumping from ring to ring back and forth experiencing an advance in the smaller personal stories until they collide into the story proper . It works brilliantly but it does require a reader to pay attention . This is not a book one can skim through . This should come as no surprise in a book where there are 18 viewpoint characters . It covers activity in three major areas of interest the lands beyond the Narrow Sea the Wall and the world north of the Wall and a few specific locations in Westeros such as King 's Landing and Winterfell.Across the sea Daenerys Stormborn the Mother of Dragons is trying to hold together her rule in Meereen seemingly reluctant to continue on to reclaim her throne in Westeros . She is burned by betrayals of the past but also seeks a marriage that will bring peace in the city . Two of her three dragons have been confined to a hold while the third Drogon roams free and is reported to have been killing children as well as livestock . In her company is Ser Barristan Selmy the former commander of the Kingsguard of King 's Landing until newlycrowned Joffrey had dismissed him . Tyrion Lannister the Imp continues his flight from Westeros after poisoning his nephew King Joffrey and murdering his own father Lord Tywin . Tyrion 's goal is to find Daenerys and offer his services to her but through a series of misfortunes he finds himself enslaved just shy of the gates of Meereen . Along the way he has also encountered Aegon Targaryen son of Prince Rhaegar long thought to have been killed when Robert Baratheon captured the Iron Throne . Aegon has set his sights on the Iron Throne for himself once he learned that his Aunt Daenerys seems content to stay in Meereen.In the North Ramsay Bolton is prepared to marry Arya Stark in the ruins of Winterfell which had previously been sacked by Theon Greyjoy . Bolton and his disgusting slaveservant Reek lead a full contingent of men to Winterfell for the wedding and also to rightfully lay claim to the castle as a provocation against Stannis the proclaimed King in the North . Stannis has been desperately seeking former Stark bannermen to join his forces and reclaim the Iron Throne since he is the only rightful heir to his late brother Robert 's crown . Stannis has sought assistance at the Wall though Jon Snow the bastard son of the late Eddard Stark and the new Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch refuses to betray the vows of the order and take sides in the conflict . Stannis wants the castles and lands on the Wall but Jon refuses to yield them . At the same time the Others are massing on the opposite side of the Wall . Jon has stirred the frustration of the King and the dislike of his wife not to mention his own brothers on the Wall by reaching out his hand in an effort to unite with the Wildlings the ageold enemies of the men of Westeros . And as winter begins to unleash its fury King Stannis and his men march on Winterfell in an effort to rescue Arya Stark and bring Ramsay Bolton to his knees.And that gives you the bare bones of about half of it . You can see why this is not a quick breezy read.While the novel is engrossing and encourages late nights and much page turning in earnest the moments spent with Jon Snow on the Wall are the most intriguing and intense . Seeing him surrounded on all sides struggling to do his duty to the realm and finding that his former enemies seem to be his only friends is nervewracking . His story seems all the more intense because as the noose tightens on all sides he is as an everloyal member of the Night 's Watch confined to the Wall . This inability to leave his surroundings serves to heighten all of the tensions.Of course across the Narrow Sea talk of Jon and the mysteries of his parentage are again brought up and readers are left with another possibility of just who Jon is born of . The other characters and their tales are freer more liberated . It does not make their stories any less interesting mind you for there are intrigues upon intrigues and conniving machinations aplenty . It is also interesting to see the ruin previously known as Theon Greyjoy . The Turncloak who betrayed the Starks and brought down Winterfell Theon has been tortured mentally and physically by Ramsay Bolton and quite literally is missing a few firing connections in his synapses . That he can cause a reader to feel sorrow for him and his present station in light of the anger he also invokes given his past treachery is a wonderful example of Martin 's mastery.Martin is an amazing storyteller . Although he writes in the epic fantasy world it is obvious when you start reading that he just simply does not write the way others do . His work is steeped more in history than fantasy but it does nothing to remove the majesty and magic from his work . Readers of fantasy live in a gifted time as there are many tremendous authors working in the genre . Along with Martin they serve to elevate the world of fantasy beyond the sneeredupon marginal work into true literary marvels that deserve the attention they are getting.A DANCE WITH DRAGONS is wholly remarkable writing from a wholly genius storyteller . If you have not yet become ensnared by the web that is the game of thrones now would be the perfect time to begin your adventure . If you 've come this far this new installment will serve to whet your appetite until THE WINDS OF WINTER lands on shelves . However many years that may take do not grow angry or frustrated or complain too loudly about the time that elapses . Martin will take every minute he needs and pay back your patience with gold . ",4
"War drags on in the Seven Kingdoms . The earlier major players are now largely dead but their children and heirs battle on . In the north Jon Snow is now commander of the black watch along the wall . In the trading cities of the south Daenerys rules over theformer slave city of Meereenand the natives are restive . Although she speaks of seizing her native kingdom Daenerys knows that the slavers would return if she leaves and can not abandon her adoptive children . So the world beats a path to Daenerys as every second son exile and wannabe power on the outs makes the voyage to the woman who mothered dragons and who has a claim to be rightful ruler of the seven kingdoms.George R. R. Martin 's epic series A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE was eyeopening and genrestretching . I remember reading A GAME OF THRONES practically breathless . Every plot twist and boy did the plot twist caught me by surprise . Every character I grew to love seemed set up to fail . Martin 's strong writing continues and he has the knack of writing characters complex enough that we care about them seeing each one as hero of his or her own story . Even Queen Cerseian adulterer incest participant and murderer becomes sympathetic . Here though in the fifth book in the series the characters seem smaller and more focussed on everyday details.Again I think Martin does fantasy a favor by adding not only the blood and dirt but also the reality of war and occupation . Victory is not a matter of marching armies through town in a parade it 's sullen opposition sneak attacks and worrying whether your allies have betrayed you or if your dragons have been eating your peoples ' children . Managing a ragtag force on the distant border is n't all about battling giants it 's watching larders empty and worrying about starvation . That being said we get a LOT of that kind of detail in a book that stretches for 959 pages not including the lists of characters.One of the key dangers in writing series is that authors find the need to move characters from point to point . That to a large extent is what is happening in A DANCE WITH DRAGONS . Tyrion is traveling to meet Daenerysbut does n't quite get there . Stannis Baratheon is traveling toward Winterfellbut does n't quite get there . Several suitors are trying to get to Daenerysbut mostly do n't get there . Arya is learning to be invisible and to be an assassinand actually makes progress . Ultimately I appreciate what Martin is doing and I think he 's adding key elements to a genre that has to a large extent offered its readers easy blacks and whites simple solutions to complex problems . But I wanted to see more happen . Fans of this series could I fear skip the entire 959 pages and pick up the next volume without having to scratch their heads and wonder what has changed . The answer to a large extent is not much.Okay I 'm a fan of Martin 's . Martin continues to be an effective wordsmith continues to create a wonderfully complex world continues to frustrate and reward his readers by refusing to let his characters find simplistic solutions to the problems they face . Overall fans of this series like me will want to read A DANCE WITH DRAGONS . There 's enough here to entertain and fascinatebut I do think it could have moved a bit faster . ",2
"Loved the series . I 'm hoping there 's a Book Six . I also want to see the HBO series . I 'll probably buy the DVD set . ",4
"I just got the book from the library and it is a doorstopper however I noticed that all the prepress and editorial reviews were all glowing while the true readers from Amazon less than glowing . I give the Amazon reviewers more credence and I 'll post after I 've finished reading if I can finish ! I give it 3 stars for the cover art improvement . ",2
"and that is why I have not rated a Feast For Crows.A Dance with Dragons is considerably better than A Feast For Crows ONLY because the characters on which POV 's are based are considerably more interesting ones.Beyond that nothing much happens . People who are hooked to this story and regrettably so because at the current pace I will be retired or worse when the thing reaches a conclusion are left clueless as to what it is all about . It feels allmost as if George R R Martin himself is lost within the vastness of the monster he created.Of one thing I am sure The addictive effect of the first 3 books is gone . I am no longer hooked and eagerly waiting for the next installment . ",2
"Once again Martin has taken the reader on a journey full of murder mayhem war and dragons . We are introduced to new and old characters that further explain where this saga may or may not end . His writing continues to astound me as the story unfolds and why am I not surprised at his need to further kill off characters we readers have grown fond of . I can not wait to see how this all ends up . Please hurry Mr. Martin and show us the next installment of Game of Thrones . Who will win the Game ? ",4
"Book 5 of the series . There is not a cliffhanger ending but there are a lot of unanswered questions . It has been a long time since A Dance with Dragons was published . Book 6 is needed HBO will be catching up id he does not get on it . ",4
"It 's a long read but not long enough . Once again just really really good stuff . I have no qualms for spending my money on this one and believe I received good value . ",4
"What a story ! It had none of the twists and turns of A Clash Of Kings I did n't cry halfway through or leap for joy at the end but was excellent in its own right for the way the story advanced and kept me involved . Simply fantastic . ",4
"This was another great addition to an amazing series but its biggest fault is that it really just set up the next two books . While I loved the adventuring featured in this book in the end nothing really happened there were no changes . My other problem with this book and all of his books is how he switches the point of view every chapter among multiple different characters . Each one is written very well but the tone shifts with each character and I end up reading the book chapter by chapter . I could n't put the book down until I finished reading the chapter but once it was over I had no desire to read what came next right away unless it was one of my favorite characters . I also did n't like Jon Snows role in this book he used to be one of my favorite characters but in this one he was really bogged down by running the wall . Once again in this book there were multiple main character deaths which I find frustrating . Along with cliffhanger probably deaths which if the people are actually dead I would be very upset and annoyed . It 's nice to know that the characters are vulnerable their victory is n't guaranteed but I would still like for my favorite characters to win some of the time.My biggest fear with this series is that Martin might die before he finishes it . I do n't mean any offense but he does n't look too healthy and I doubt you could get someone to finish the series successfully . The fantasy world was lucky when Brandon Sanderson took over for Robert Jordan I do n't know if they 'd be that lucky a second time . I hope that it wo n't take another 5 years to write each book because he would then be 73 which is pushing it even for a healthy man . Still I enjoyed this book and look forward to the end of the series . ",3
"The chapters change characters so abruptly sometimes you feel like you missed something . Story will jump into the middle of a situation then explain backwards and back to the present . Seems written in a different style than the previous books takes a little longer to read but definitely worth it ! ",4
"Feel like I have to read this as I 've read the others in the series . Pretty boring though . Not much action just furthers the story line of 3 of the main characters . Yawn . ",2
"I found myself flipping through numerous pages because the dialogue was repeated many times and it was slow and uninteresting . ",1
"Although it took Mr. Martin a very long time to bring us this story it was worth the wait . Excellent . ",4
"George R R Martin never disapoints . Each book keeps you tied to your chair . ",4
"I received one of the copies of A Dance with Dragons that were accidentally released early . I 've written two reviews . The first is an informal completely spoilerfree commentary for fans of the series who want a quick judgment of the book . The second is a longer more wideranging review which includes some mild spoilers about various characters ' arcs and the structure of the book as well as comments on theme and tone that may imply larger spoilers . There will also be spoilers for earlier books.So . Is it better than A Feast for Crows ? The question is a leading one it assumes that Feast was a bad or a weak book . I actually liked Feast quite a lot both on first reading lo these many years ago and on rereading it in recent weeks . Considering what the evolution of the story had made it I thought it was the best book it could possibly be and that the author 's atmospheric worldbuilding and vivid characters were supplemented by a sense of encroaching doom the imminence of magic and of winter.But of course I 'll concede that for many the book 's relaxed pace and style was a disappointment after the ridiculouslyeventful A Storm of Swords . A Dance with Dragons has more surprises and revelations than Feast but those who absolutely despised that novel will very possibly be frustrated by this one as well unless what they disliked was the particular characters involved rather than the structure . The beginning is strong with a number of developments and answered questions people may not have been expecting but after that the middle of the book returns to the significant but very gradual plot evolution that characterized Feast . There are some atmospheric worldbuilding and set pieces that are very effective but perhaps not worth inclusion in a book that 's very long and focuses on only half the characters to boot . Some of what seems irrelevant may turn out to be important later of course . The climax though ups the ante again with more sudden and shocking developments capped by what I think is the best final chapter in the series to date . The Winds of Winter looks set to return to the constant action and rapid development of A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords and while some may wish that could have happened at the beginning of Dance rather than near the end I think there 's enough going on in this book to satisfy all but the most disaffected readers.Mildly spoilerish review begins here.Here it is . Nearly six years after the last installment of A Song of Ice and Fire George R. R. Martin 's gritty epic fantasy the new book A Dance with Dragons has arrived . But in some ways the wait for this book has been even longer as 2005 's A Feast for Crows only featured half of the series ' major characters because the novel grew so much during the writing process that it could n't be published in its original form . The author originally hoped to published this companion volume within a year of that book but the story grew more and other problems intervened . As a result A Dance with Dragons marks the first appearance of some of the series ' most popular characters in over a decade.Tyrion Lannister the brilliant but increasingly bitter dwarf son of one of the realm 's great houses Richard III is an obvious general model for the character has fled the royal seat at King 's Landing after murdering his father . Aimless at first he is soon set on a new path by an ally of the eunuch spymaster Varys who had been vital in his escape . But the journey he faces is long uncertain and dangerous and several dark developments along the way threaten to further his decline into cruelty.Jon Snow is now Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch the organization sworn to guard the massive Wall against incursions from the frozen north . Jon is determined to make the changes he believes necessary to meet the Watch 's purpose in changing times but he must contend with doubtful subordinates and the presence at the Wall of the rebel king Stannis who seems determined to test the Watch 's commitment to staying out of the politics of the realm . Caught between the king and the Watch Jon must walk a narrow path where a single misstep could bring disaster.Daenerys Targaryen last survivor of the realm 's former royal house is half a world away trying to rule the city she has conquered . She has three dragons and a large welltrained army on her side but Meereen 's customs are alien to her its people difficult to rule without draconian measures she can not accept and the price she must pay for control may prove more than she can bear . Even the blood of the dragon is not guaranteed easy allegiance.These are the three most prominent characters of A Dance with Dragons taking up about half its length but there are many others including a few returning faces from A Feast for Crows . The presence of those characters and their storylines gives the novel 's climax an added energy it sorely needs for the middle of the book is by structural necessity slowmoving as various situations gradually approach the breaking point . This pace may be familiar to certain frustrated readers of A Feast for Crows who had expected something closer to the relentless action of A Storm of Swords the third book in the series . But A Dance with Dragons is undeniably more eventful than A Feast for Crows and certain character arcs are structured to end in the middle of the book which means that their resolutions come early and offer a jolt of action to counterpoint those arcs that are still developing.Questions of plot aside the author 's characterization and worldbuilding are as fascinating as ever . Jon and Daenerys are very young and unlike many youthful heroes in the fantasy genre who rule nations or command armies when little more than children and do it perfectly they have their flaws and failures as well as virtues and successes . There are no unambiguously good or bad leaders in Martin 's world only characters with different personalities and worldviews who are all determined to manipulate the current chaos to their own benefit . As rich as the milieu has been in the first four volumes A Dance with Dragons gives us aweinspiring new locations as well as old ones seen in new ways . The Winds of Winter may be the title of the next volume but this one gives us a haunting foretaste of what that chill will be like.The world of A Song of Ice and Fire has always been harsher than that of many fantasies inspired by real history less romanticized and putting as much emphasis on the cruelties and desolation of medieval warfare as on noble heroism and elegant courtly intrigue . A Dance with Dragons is no exception and the evolution of the story in this book is along dark lines dominated by failures that sow seeds of chaos the next volume seems likely to reap in abundance . The final chapters mark a return to the unexpected and fastmoving action to which fans have become accustomed and confirm what many readers have hoped that a beloved but delayplagued series is after a long middle period finally entering its endgame . ",4
"Like a lot of others I was fed up waiting for this book . When it finally arrived my concern was would it be worthwhile ? Yes and yes and yes yet again . The pace may not be to everyones liking but for me it was akin to the tangled webs of John Le Carre 's spy novels . The various plots are carefully and slowly developed sometimes colliding oft times proceeding in unpredictable directions . Like the preceeding volumes it is the development of the characters that makes this book so good . There are no 'black ' or 'white ' personalities here the sadistic the fanatical the insane the devout the bloodthirsty all get their say.And then.he leaves us teetering on the edge.Alright George..enjoy the plaudits take a well earned break and then please get started again ! ",4
"A Song of Ice and Fire is every bit as good as you 've heard and then some . ADoD drags on a big slow in the middle parts as much of the story feels already known after AFfC but Martin includes enough new developments and plot twists to keep you engaged long enough to reach the real fun part the last 14 or so of the book when all the storylines begin really progressing and the table is set for the final two books . The Winds of Winter ca n't come soon enough ! ",4
"I read the first Ice and Fire books years ago a couple of years before Feast for Crows even came out . So its safe to say Ive been waiting a 'while ' for this book . I did the whole check the website mark my calender hooray the book is coming out only to see its not again and again.So the book was scheduled for release same day my wife was scheduled to have a baby ! I went to the store the night before and haggled the lady at the counter please let me buy it tonight I promise I wont tell anyone . She wouldnt relent and lucky me I managed to stop at the bookstore on the way to the hospital.The next several days I had lots of time to do nothing but wait at times . I simply couldnt get interested in the book . It started slow . I can live with that . So over the next couple of weeks I continued reading a little here and a little there . Certainly not the 3am page turner that the first books were.What it really comes down to is this . Martin spent a lot of pages writing about characters who are very interesting yet doing nothing . Presidents are probably interesting guys when doing their job . Presidents eating breakfast not so much . Yet I feel this is the direction Martin has taken . Writing lots of pages about interesting characters doing very uninteresting things.I cant say I did not like the book . I liked it but I liked it a lot less than I thought I would and after a what 6 year wait I was hoping for a lot more.One can only hope that Feast For Crows and Dance With Dragons is the calm before some giant storm that is to be the next in the series . Im really hoping Martin doesnt take a detour down Robert Jordan street and write 10 more books about nothing . ",2
"The action in A Dance With Dragons following on A Feast for Crows sets the stage for a joining of Westeros 's north and south all contenders in both aiming as ever to bring the continent into some kind of unity after years of vicious civil war . It 's an amazing read that you just ca n't put down I 'll say that for sure . Another astounding read you will have too wrap your eyes around isNekhet Dreamlinesimply wonderful a real page turner . Just do n't take my word for it get your copy here on amazon . ",4
"I am a huge fan of Martin since the first time I read him back in the nineties . Just like everyone else I was disappointed with book 4 . It was written well but did n't seem to go anywhere and Cersei and Jamie chapters are n't near as interesting as the chapters of the characters in Dance . So I was excited to read Dance and yet anxious because I was n't too sure what I was going to get the writing of the first 3 or the writing of Feast . Gladly almost right from the very beginning the Martin of old has returned to us.The characters are gritty and real . Some are good some are bad and like Martin of old good things happen to bad people and bad things happen to good people . We get to watch Jon as he struggles to control the Night 's Watch and come to terms with what he is struggling with beyond the wall . I loved his chapters probably the most of the main characters . Tyrion 's grew on me although I did n't care for them as much in the beginning . Daenerys also grew on me although I wish her chapters would have had more resolution and moved the plot forward more.In the end you can tell Dance is setting up the greater climax in the coming final 2 books but it at least had my interest from chapter one so I did n't mind that the plot did n't move as much as in the first three books . I was entertained for all 950 pages and left wanting to read book 6 even more so . If only Martin would hurry up . I mean the HBO series is going to be producing a series a year so Martin must have some idea of where his final two books stand in relation to the HBO series . A definite recommend.5 stars.PS As a side note I am amazed at the number of 1 and 2 star reviews . I think it is a direct relation to how long it took Martin to come out with Dance and the fact that Feast left something to be desired . Readers went in to Dance jaded and completely ruined their perspective of where Martin was and where he is now . And what 's with the 1000 word reviews ? Honestly I 've never seen a book with so many people from 5 star to 1 star writing novellas about it . Does anyone honestly ever read a review when you have to scroll down the page ? ",4
"Martin did an excellent job of advancing his plots . He chose to focus on each characterstoryline consecutively instead of advancing each thread more or less simultaneously as is often done . I admit it does n't really work as well as the simultaneous method but I 've often wondered how his method would work so I do n't hold it against him . ",3
"I tried to start this book three times and each time I could not finish it . Finally I sat down and forced myself to read it . GRRM has famously said this book was a bh to write . Well it was a bh to read too . There was some plot movement in the book but not nearly enough for a book this size . Most of the characters I cared about are not the same as they were in the first 3 books and the changes are inexplicable to me . The story is weighed down by endless subplots and a parade of new characters that are growing impossible for me to keep straight . GRRM has shown himself to rely on strange gimmicks whether it was the endless and annoying use of nuncle in Feast to opening up his bag of tricks as a 80 's TV hack and relying on multiple cliff hangers in Dance that would make the producers of Dallas or Dynasty blush with embarrassment . From where I am sitting GRRM has lost all discipline and interest in this project so whether he publishes again is a question in my mind . I find myself no longer caring which is a shame . ASOIAF was something special once . ",1
"When I bought the first book I understood that there were five books in the series but I assumed that would be the end of it . You know what that say about when you assume something . I 'm sixty percent through this last book of the series and I doubt that this is the end of the story.I feel like I was strung along so that I would buy more books . I would n't call it false pretense but if I had known this from the beginning I would have stopped reading this series a long while ago.If you want a never ending story have at it . ",2
"I was totally impressed with this oneMUCH better than Book 4 . Can not wait for book 6 to come out soon ! ",4
"I was one of the rare few who waited a year and a half for the paperback edition of Book 5 . Though some of the plot points were spoiled for me GRR Martin continues to surprise and frustrate his fans . ",4
"Review originally posted on The Book Addict 's Guide A DANCE WITH DRAGONS was my very last read in 2013 closing out the year epically ! I & # 8217m so glad I got to finish this in 2013 to totally finish the read along for A Song of Ice and Fire all in 2013 ! PHEW ! ! ! ! And now that I & # 8217m finished & # 8230 Can you say series hangover ? So A DANCE WITH DRAGONS . It & # 8217s a toss up between that and A STORM OF SWORDS to name a favorite of the series so far because both were pretty epic in their own rites although for the love of Pete these are all flipping epic but A DANCE WITH DRAGONS felt a bit more anticipated simply because of the fulllength novel setup that was A FEAST FOR CROWS . As stated in my review for AFFC this was more the & # 8220part two & # 8221 focusing back on the main characters that dominated the first three books and boy was I happy to see them again ! First things first THE DRAGONS . WOOOOO ! ! Loved seeing their prominence in this book and consequently how badass yes even more so that Dany became because of her dedication to them . She & # 8217s also pretty badass on her own and she & # 8217s still one of my favorite characters ! I loved how much the dragons affected the characters themselves as well as the overall plot of the book.One thing I notice looking back from when I first picked up A GAME OF THRONES is really how different these characters are from when the series first started . The villains have shown their softer side and they & # 8217ve suffered their own plights as well . Many people that started off the series as antagonists had me feeling quite a bit of sympathy for them ! Also of course spending so much time with all of the characters has really instilled a place in my heart for them . We & # 8217ve been reading these massive books for ten months now and when I finished & # 8230 . I honestly didn & # 8217t know what to do . Sometimes I still feel weird that I & # 8217m NOT reading them because I hadn & # 8217t taken a break for ten months ! As usual GRRM throws in a few insane twists that you did not see coming . And I love it . At times sure I still want to throttle him as I & # 8217m sure most of his readers do but I also appreciate that the heroes of these books are never fully safe . I find something realistic about that because hey bad things happen to the good guys too.The way this plot has grown from the first book is incredible too . There are so many different layers of the story & # 8212 from one character to the next and multiple characters being involved in many different big events . Even the smallest things they do can turn out to have a big effect on the entire story . It & # 8217s quite fascinating how detailed this world is and yet how well GRRM keeps it all together and constantly moving . ",4
"My mother and husband talked me into reading these series . I absolutely loved them . And book 5 was one of my favorites . I can not wait until he finishes and releases the next one ! ",4
"WARNING SPOILERS As much as I love this series there are a few things that I have realised too late . Nothing ever happens . George will lead you through thousands of words and build up on an event and after investing all this time in reading about it he then proceeds to have that said event made redundant . For example in previous books you will read about the KingBeyondtheWall and how kickarse he is and about his efforts to build an immense unstoppable army and about the various clans in painstaking detail and the politics within those clans and about his efforts to obtain a magical horn to knock down the wall and his life previous and hopes and dreams of the wildlings and about his unborn child and you will read about the intensely detailed ranger missions to gather intelligence on the wildings and you will read about what is seen the creatures the clans the weather the terrain etc etc etc etc etc This goes on forever so the reader is expecting some big event and huge climax as one would expect but no What we get is the wildings finally attacking and then in about five sentences it is destroyed by another king who was on the other side of Westeros . The way this whole thread was just cut off and disbanded was infuriating . This is what I mean by NOTHING EVER HAPPENS . This happens ALL the time.I mean we read about Snow and his painful climb to the head of the Night Watch . This carries on forever and the reader is guessing that George is setting up some awesome reason that Jon Snow has become the leader of the Night Watch and we are excited because we believe he will lead the army of the Night Watch to save his sister etc etc but no After investing a million hours reading about this the Night Watch stab Jon Snow a billion times at the end of the book . The end . You know nothing Jon Snow.The whole thing with the Red Wedding really pissed me off . I mean I read books worth about this fool gallivanting about dodging armies fighting armies capturing people etc etc and then WHAM ! He 's dead . Again there was nothing achieved and nothing really happened . Nothing ever happens in this series.Even in this latest book nothing has happened.Also in this current book I am supposed to be talking about why did I need to read a small book 's worth about the Imp riding down a river on an old boat ? Why has Cersi now had her wings clipped ? I need someone to hate.Another thing that is kinda creeping me out is George 's great detail on various character 's penises or cnts . Now I really do n't think this is nesessary in a fantasy novel or really any novel . George seems to be trying to make his books ultrarealistic but most of us would read fantasies to get away from real life no ? That said for some reason I really do love reading these books and that is why I am giving this book 4stars . It may be the beautiful language used to describe the world or the intriguing character build up and their many layers of grey . It might just be the journey of the various characters . I am not sure but I if you can stomach a massive read I would still recommend this over most other fantasy series . ",3
"This book is a lot better than book 4 which was clearly disappointing . Dialogues are excellent . This book is comparable to the 3 first ones . It is a must read for the genre lovers . ",4
"I have nothing more to add to what other disappointed readers have already pointed out . This does not seem to be the work of the same genius who penned the first three booksAn absolute waste of timeHave no further expectations out of this authorLeft a bitter taste in the mouth ",0

"I ca n't remember when I read and read and fell asleep at night with my Tablet in my hand . I also do n't remember shouting at the characters while I was reading like Dany use the dragons let them out of the pit and toast the slavers and sellswords . Arya never disappoints and more than any other character continues to grow and develop her potential . I ca n't wait until she realizes that she is a skinchanger and reunites with Nymeria . I also found myself shouting at George Martin when I realized that there were only 200 pages left and there are more things up in the air than could be concluded in 500 pages . I called the two people who got me into the series and said I thought this was the end . Now tell me when the next book will be published . George please stay healthy and keep writing . ",4
"I thoroughly enjoyed this book . It was worth the long wait . Hopefully it wo n't be another 5 years to wait for book 6.The story is still just as good as when I first started so long ago . The characters are still just as interesting & flawed as they were when the story began . The new characters introduced add much to the overall story.If you have n't been reading this story what are you waiting on . ",3
"Really excited to read this after the first 4 books but yet now it seems to drag on . Just personal opinion on this . Still I am waiting for book 6 so I can finally find out what happens to some of the characters others I could care less about . Lets just hope he finishes it before everyone loses interest in the series . ",3
"I think book 5 was too long and drawn out . Especially when giving the lineage of some of the minor players . More action towards the end but felt unfulfilled with so many loose ends still hanging . ",2
"Some folks out there are saying that the latest books in this series are losing their magicnot so . I admit that Feast of Crows was a little slow at times but this makes up for it and we see a lot more of our favorite the dragon queen and the Imp.You will not be disappointed ! ",4
"Edit finished the book a week ago . I stand by everything I said . I was really hoping for the second half to pick up and it did n't except for the one moment where the author went OMG look ! Are n't you shocked ? ! ! . But honestly by then all of that character 's chapters were so tedious and repetitious an unfortunately common problem for this book that I wanted to join in on what the bad guys did just to make him stop boring me.original reviewAnd after 15 years GRRM is still the best writer I 've come across for descriptive and characterdevelopment writing . Mostly due to the prologue I 'm finally finding the whole warg thing less boring and seeing it less as pure newagey mumblejumble . But my concern is I 've read in places that the book really picks up momentum after the halfway mark ? So I still have another 20 % of menu and tripplanning to plod through before that happens ? Still I really hope it does pick up because so far I do n't see anything happening other than they had X stewed in Y for insert meal here and he sailedwalkedwent on horseback for yet another day . It 's like AFFC all over again like I 'm reading a travel book except the author only talks about sitting on the plane and brushing his teeth in airport hotels or should I say pissing because there really is an awful lot of urination in this book rather than the destinations themselvesI 'm squeezing time out of bar review to read this book and I really hope there 's going to be something more worthwhile.One little thing I 'm absurdly happy about is that GRRM has really cut back on Lord Mormont 's crow . Man how I hated that stupid echoing crow . Glad it does n't say corn corn corn corn corn corn corn corn after every sentence anyone says anymore . ",2
"First let me state that I am a big fan of the series but am very disappointed in the direction the last 2 books have taken . I 'm 34 through this book and have completely lost interest and lost track of half the characters . Most of the new characters are shallow and could easily have been left out . So far most of the original characters are barely mentioned or not even mentioned at all . Mr Martin get back to the basics of your original book please . ",1
"A Song of Ice and Fire stands at the pinnacle of realworld fantasy.When you read look for no happy endings no faeries to guide the heroine no flowered words and gallant princes to save the day.Blood Death and Fire They are all you 'll find.These are the most captivating stories I 've ever read and they leave you hungering for more as you cheer the death of a villain and mourn silently the fall of your personal hero . Mr. Martin is a genius pure and simple . He writes with an exceptional whit and humour that tailors itself flawlessly to the dark and dire nature of the plot.The greatest fantasy novels I have ever read . ",4
"A really good read but I was hoping for more movement in the story and character experiences after waiting five years for this next chapter . I hear Martin plans on another 35 books in this series I 'll be near death at this rate . Do n't read this until you finish the previous 4 books in the series you 'll be lost and never finish it . Drags along in places and I forced myself to finish it in hopes the next one will be better . ",2
"Long descriptions of characters and places never before heard of . I assume that somewhere down the line these places and characters will be brought back into the story but the characters we were following were no where to be seen for a good portion of the beginning of the book . The ending of course ends with us wondering what happens to the characters we know and love . Now I wonder just how many books there are coming and if it 's worth continuing to follow the series .

"Getting real tired of your shit Dany . Stop whining and regrow the pair you had in the earlier books . R+L=J ! ! ! ",4
"Disgusted by the trend started by Jordan all those years ago to create the unending series . And now Martin continues the process . How can you really have a voice or a point of view if you just keep babbling on and on ? ? Finish it even if you give it a lame ending stop thinking about dollars and more about your craft . And 4 to 5 years between books how is that not about money ? ",0
"I am done . Sad to say this book has finished the ASOIAF journey for me . Nothing happens except around 500 pages of filler . The storyline has grown way too unweildy and uninteresting . Even a Feast for Crows was n't this bad . A thousand pages of Tyrion getting captured again and again with little of his usual quick wit to keep amusement sustained . Throw in Dany 's struggle in Mereen which has tons of descriptive detail that is really not necessary and adds nothing to the story . No action whatsoever . Even the chapters with Jon Snow did n't have the spark they did in the first three books . I 'm actually two hundred pages from finishing the book and I do n't think I 'm going to make it . I had to stop and read other books out of pure boredom . I hate that this has happened to this series . The first three books were the best fantasy that had come out in years . I did give this book two stars for the Bran and Theon storyline which was at least semiinteresting.I also think this series which has been drawn out supposedly into 7 books now has stopped my propensity from buying series that have n't been finished . It is happening too often for my taste in this genre and I refuse to keep spending money on the premise of a series that will either take my lifetime to finish or never come out . I am also sick and tired of funding the watching of Jets games movie deals monthly vacations etc for an author who really ca n't take criticism and does n't seem to have any respect for the fans who do n't agree with his every thought . Enough ! ",1
"So the first time I read this I agreed with a lot of the other reviewers . Too much skipping around not enough of my favorite characters no resolution of anything . . . Second time around I ca n't remember why I thought those things . I loved it I do n't want to give anything away but going back a second time and really reading all the chapters instead of skimming the ones I was n't as interested in really added a whole new dimension and level of appreciation . ",4
".. to keep reading this book . I am not even a 13 of the way in and feel like I 'm walking in quicksand and the further I go the more I sink and all I can feel is the terror of drowning so slowly and boringly that people will just stand and laugh at me . I may be able to pick this back up later .. maybe . I realy feel that this book even more so than one of the others which I ca n't remember at this point as my mind is filled with sludge minutae was drawn out purposely . Do n't keep dragging things out man . Give the story some peace and end if it you need to and move onto another project . That slow agonizing dying death sound is me suffering through the pages . ",1
"Never quite delving into the world that is fantasy literature a few years ago I stumbled upon George R. R. Martin 's epic series A Song of Ice and Fireand it was love at the first turn of the page . Now 6 years after the last installment A Feast for Crows was released Martin has delivered another masterpiece . A Dance with Dragons the fifth and latest book in the series has proved to be more than well worth the wait that had fans crying foul . The first 600 of nearly 1000 pages of the book pick up with many of the beloved characters that had been missing since the end of the third installment . But Dance goes further reuniting some of the characters from the previous story as the narrative moves ever onward . While other reviewers seemed to think there was not enough plot resolution I think this tale does nothing but build up the excitement and suspense for the next book.Without sending out any spoilers Dance is the ultimate quest novel . From suitors racing to the east to win the hand of the Dragon Queen Daenerys Targaryen to the frozen lands north of the Wall where Jon Snow must keep an ancient evil at bay Martin 's characters must struggle to find order in the chaos that threatens to overwhelm them . As battles and treachery continue to divide the land of Westeros in the final stages of the wars for the Iron Throne in the East mounting threats to Daenerys ' rule continue to grow . Meanwhile moving ever eastward Tyrion Lannister flees for his life with a motley band who may turn out to be the most dangerous threat to the Dragon Queen.Poignant physical haunting and even frustrating at times Martin 's A Dance with Dragons delivers all and more than promised . A pageturning story for people who love fantasy and even those who do n't you ca n't miss the latest tale in what promises to be one of the most epic series the genre has ever seen.Caitlin Warnock ",4
"The only thing I hate about the series is the killing of soooo many good characters but even that does not stop me wanting more NOW ! I am hoping mr. Martin has the good sense to let Jon Snow live ! ! ! ",3
"It was a pulling together of many threads running through The Game of Thrones . Some were clipped short others hinted at games yet to come . The tension between Ice and Fire takes no prisoners . You will either be grateful you live a life of comfort and ease or dream of joining the fray . ",3
"Long book that goes into depth but still awaiting to see if something good happens to the Starks ! ! ! Ca n't wait till next book . ",4
"Now I can hardly wait for HBO to start the second season . I was disappointed that the fifth book ended the series . This was a story that could have gone on and on . ",4
"Would n't you think that after reading the boring book four I 'd have had the brains enough not to buy book 5 ? In my own defense I have to say that somewhere or other I got the notion that book 5 would end the series and so I bought it just to see how it ended . Imagine my surprise when I discovered that this waste of time and money still has two more books to go before the series mercifully ends.I have managed to wade through 300 pages of A Dance with Dragons and can not bring myself to finish this seemingly endless mess of going nowhere . I almost said going nowhere fast but in fact A Dance with Dragons goes nowhere painfully sloooowly.What happened to the forward momentum that drove the first three books ? What happened to characters we care about ? What happened tooh never mind if I keep this up it 'll end up as longwinded as the book . ",0
"Thank you George R.R . Martin for giving me hours of pleasure and imaginative writing . Please do n't take to long to write Number Six . ",3
"5 stars for this book . I am a fan since day 1 read all the books twice except the last one I do have some life ! ! I felt compelled to review this because i feel that anything less than 45 stars is not fair . This is a great story and it DOES advance the plot . In my opinion Martin is still at the top of his game and this continues his series with detailed and moving characters and plots . ",4
"I 'm a huge fan of ASOIAF and the HBO series to the extent that I 've had to buy multiple copies of the earlier books because I 've worn them out from rereading . Luckily I think ! for me I picked up the series between ASOS and AFFC so I have n't been left with as unbearable a wait as some others.With ADWD many of the problems that spawned out of splitting the planned fourth book into AFFC and ADWD some of which were already present in the last book have become hard to ignore and detract greatly from the overall reading experience . Not every novel needs to have the breathless pace and constant action of A Storm of Swords but both AFFC and especially ADWD suffer from a languid pace that leaves you wondering when is something going to happen ? more than what will happen next ? .It was nice to see some of the characters left out of AFFC again although I ca n't say I was all that pleased with what we did get . Tyrion 's travelogue through Essos could have been interesting had it 1 not been so drawn out and 2 not felt quite so contrived with running into a certain character in Volantis to continue his story . It 's nice to get some worldbuilding unlike many people I see post I 'm actually very interested in knowing more about Essos but it just does n't work when you spread Tyrion 's journey across an entire huge book to do so especially compard to the more reasonable way travel was dealt with in say AGOT when Catelyn can get around Westeros without needing the entire book to do so.Dany reappears but well her character and storyline are both rather stagnant until her last couple of chapters wherewellit 's not that significant things happen so much as it seems like they 're about to happen . Small victories I guess . Theon returns he lives ! and probably is the most compelling PoV character in the book . He 's not really on a redemption arc but his psychological sufferings are quite vivid and the goingson in the North are probably the book 's strong point on top of it . I wish I could say the same for the Wall but while it was good to see Jon suffer some consequences for his decisions many of his chapters felt rather repetitive someone comes in to tell him some advice Jon ignores it Jon deals with wildlings repeat . Brienne though figuring significantly in AFFC is present but her appearance feels extremely tacked on and without any real purpose other than to set up a cliffhanger.What else ? Well there 's the multiple cliffhangers that while dramatic at first are now tiresome Brienne returns from one cliffhanger to exit in another ugh the excessive description of traveling food urination sex etc . that while providing a lot of detail of the world the story takes place in does little to actually move the story forward . Repetitive phrases where do whores go ? etc . are introduced descriptions we 've heard ten thousand times are back did any of you know the Sand Snakes are deadly ? that they might hide poison or knives in their clothes ? and the book as a whole feels more like it 's about putting people in place than anything else . As an aside it 's fitting Areo Hotah appears as a PoV character again in ADWD because he 's the same just there so we can see Doran but offering basically nothing aside from it.Now if you 've actually read somemostall of this minirant you may be wondering what I liked about the book . Frankly I 'm feeling a bit tired of my own ponderous writing at this point so I 'll use bullets.1 Theon Davos the political situation in the North in general2 Aegon Targaryen ? though I admit he should have been introduced earlier probably and I also liked his chapters because they provided much needed action.3 Wyman Manderly4 The Melisandre PoV was a good example of how to give a PoV to a character to flesh them out and not simply to relay plot details plus Melisandre 's role is interestingDespite my complaints above I feel like we 've finally trudged through AFFC and ADWD and the series is in a position where a sense of 'normalcy ' can return the characters in Essos are all more or less positioned where they need to be to meet Dany in particular . I just wish the journey to get there had been more engaging and worthwhile . ",1
"A bit rambling with the introduction of new characters . As other reviewers have noted it has grown more difficult to separate the story lines in these later books . Overall the book maintains the richness and attraction of the previous books it is just not as well put together and has too many characters . It is hard to read and maintain focus over more than an hour or two . ",2
"Well I was so impressed with the first 3 books in the series . Book four was mostly a big setup for what I had hoped would be an Epic Book Five . I am just so disappointed by how weak and pitiful all of my favorite heroes and villains have become I feel cheated I was bored and found myself skimming . ",2
"I ca n't say it any better than some of the other reviewers already have said it . The author has lost his way developed too many characters that we do n't care about and spent too many words saying nothing.I wish I had not spent the money and much more importantly the time on this book . This author is too busy writing cookbooks and blogging about football he should turn the franchise over to someone else so they can at least finish the stories . We read books to escape not to be tortured.Also the american tolkein ? Really ? The way these last 2 books have been they really are just rated M or NC17 soap operas.SPOILER ALERTCliffhangers that simply do not get resolved e.g . Brienne how did she get out of being hung ? thought it would be resolved in this book ? WRONG.Seige by Stannis and then it 's over with NO DETAILS . Wow . Big twist with the onion knight . He 's dead he 's not dead in the end who cares nothing happens . Just a huge waste of time . ",0
"I love how these books flow and keep right on moving along . These books never disappoint . Now the very long wait until the next book comes out . Loved this book ! ",4
"I am glad I did not become thoroughly convinced this book was a stinker by all the negative and soso reviews here . As it was I put off reading it for awhile because I somehow knew I would not like it . But surprisingly I really liked it . Much better than the usual claptrap that is produced as fantastic fiction these days . DWD was well written thought provoking and intense at times . The only problem I usually have with these books is the orgy of cruelty and brutality lavished upon the reader . Martin could use to stand back a bit from the excruciating detail involving this but that is a minor flaw to me . As for waiting another six years to find out what happens to the characters no big deal . There are plenty of other great books to read while waiting . ",4
"Follows the nicely organized previous four books in which each character 's and its environment at every stage of the whole story is neatly presented . Ca n't wait for the next book . ",3
"I love these books ! Book 5 was a significant improvement over Book 4 Feast of Crows and picks up the story where Book 3 left off . ",3
"A great continuation of the series . I do n't know why all the bad reviews I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it and the whole series to any reader . Now just to wait for the next book to be written . ",4
"Clearly Martin has lost the passion for this story . Actually found myself skimming pages to get to the next part and I 'm a patient reader . What a shame . I do n't think one can be the American Tolkien without actually finishing the tale and with this book I 'm feeling like the tale may never be finished this installment seems to have been sheer drudgery for Martin to write . The earlier books let you feel like you were there the scenes in this one seem more like sketches with shorthand references thrown in . ",1
"Much better than book 4 I ca n't wait for book six . Hurry up mr Martin you take too long and I want to know what happens to my favorite characters . Such twists and turns . Excellent . ",4
"George R.R . Martin is a very good writer ! I just wish he would stop killing off all the good guys in each book and Book Five is no exception ! So do n't like a character too muchhe may not make to the end of the book ! ",4
"This is great series . I am glad I bought it . I had a great deal of time to read as I am recovering from surgery and the books are very entertaining . ",4
"My husband has really loved this series and I have heard the same comments from many others who have also read this series . ",4
"I have waited years for this latest book in the Fire and Ice Series . It was well worth the wait . I think it was his best work to date . Looking forward to George R.R . Martin 's next book in the series ",4
"It 's like the author got tired of the whole saga and left everything up in the air nothing was resolved at the end . He kills off some and the others ? who knows because he obviously did n't either . ",1
"Love the story love the unique characters . Felt like I really got to know them . There is a total of 5 books however it felt as though it was not finished and there should be one more book to finish the story . Also caught some of the characters on the tv show Game of Thrones . So glad I read the book first it really put all in place . BUT believe me these are long long long books . ",4
"Loved loved loved all 5 so hooked . I hope there is more and will definately read any thing else he has written . ",4
"I waited for years and years and years for this book . It was not worth it.I want to start off by saying that George RR Martin is a master author . He does a classically solid job of putting together a tangled web of insanity that is Westerosthe world . I have no objection in that regard that 's why I read his books.However the problem is that it 's nto even as good as his first book in this series . My favorite part was definitely Arya because I want her to come back and take over Westeros . I hope that GRRM does n't kill her because he has a habit of killing the nice characters with whom you sympathize.My second favorite bit behind Arya was the way that Kevan Lannister ALMOST saved the kingdom . It was very much in line with what GRR Martin said about a good man not being a good King and how Jimmy Carter was the best man but possibly the worst president in his lifetime look up GRRM on the Youtube channel Authors @ Google.The book was n't worth the time that I spent reading about all the other characters though . If it had been worth 6 years of waiting it would have been mindblowingly phenomenal . Instead it was just ok and a simple continuation of the story . Disappointing . ",2
"This is a continuation of the other . Books . Love it . This was a little slow but worth the pace . Good ! ! ! ! ",3
"Gods be good . Has George R.R . Martin descended into some Sisyphean hell where he is forever condemned to pen a saga he has come to detest ? Apparently wearied of Westeros he appears to pine instead for persianesque climes . But unlike the One Thousand and One Nights these 1016 pages are unlikely to beguile either king or commoner.Even before this volume Martin evidences a slipping of the literary leash . Not only does his continued killing off of important characters often feel arbitrary and capricious but the methodical physical and psychological maiming of the remaining protagonists cripples the story itself . Deaths and devastating injuries should be significant in fiction . They should propel a plot in an importantly different direction . So far this has not happened in A Song of Ice and Fire . There have been numerous opportunities for such an occurrence but then a central figure is dispatched and the particular narrative falters.By A Dance With Dragons some of the original POVsubplots should be merging . Instead they are wafting farther apart and are being weakened in entanglements with dozens of new personages and precipitous plot swings . At times by fits and starts the story seems to be morphing into a decidedly different tale . But then such digressions prove to be mere dalliances as Martin purges his yarn of one more character with whom he has apparently become bored . It makes a reader want to bite her lip in despair . For Martin 's writing style is just as bold and true as ever . His descriptions are finely drawn and deliberate and his dialogue as crisp and engaging as in A Game of Thrones.Hardcore fans are bound to engage this book even if they have to endure legions of new characters whether nameless wildlings or nonWesterosi with nonmemorable monikers . Such fans will do so simply to revel in the further misadventures of Tyrion Jon Cersei Dany et alia.After all Winds of Winter is coming . ",1
"At my age and considering how slow Martin is I may not see the end of this series because he 's older then I am.I 'm reading the whole series . This whole series is great but Martin needs to write faster . There are so many characters and the plot is so complex its hard to keep track of everyone.At the third book I had to go back and reread one and two because of the time that had gone by . At that time I thought there was only to be three books . ",3
"A Dance with Dragons was markedly better than A Feast For Crows . I felt that Book 4 was all over the place and I was a bit worried about where the series was going after finishing Book 4 . There is still a lot of bouncing around in Book 5 but Martin did a good job of keeping his story lines fairly clear . This was something that I found lacking in Book 4 . I feel that he is falling into the same trappings that Robert Jordan fell into with his Wheel of Time series . There are too many characters and there 's almost too much going on to keep track of but to me that spells out a great series and it means that there will be many more books in this series to enjoy.The plot lines that I am most looking forward to in the next book are Arya Tyrion Cersei Daenarys and Jamie and Brienne.Martin is great at delivering shocking twists in his plot lines and Book 5 proves to be no exception . Those twists all happened at the end of the book but I suppose that is the point . I 'm definitely more than ready to the next book in the series . ",3
"dont ever get attached to a character from this series ! ! you 'll have your heart ripped out stomped on and mailed back to you in pieces if you do ! cant wait for the next installment ! ",4
"The book is engrossing even if by this time the reader sees some things coming . Martin is the consummate craftsman . ",3
"So much has been written in reviews that I wo n't belabor much of what has already been said . I have read all 5 books on Kindle in the past 6 months so I am new to the series . I had been interested in reading them but reviews were mixed and given the length of the books I was not sure I wanted to jump in . I 'm glad I did.Book 5 is far reaching and introduces a number of new characters . Thankfully Martin gives us a list of them that is pages and pages long and an ever expanding map so we can visualize where the action is happening.Martin in this series has essentially created a new and complex world full in intriguing characters . Unfortunately it seems that as with these characters he has gotten lost and just muddles through their world . The time spent Meereen is particularly tedious . I was introduced to characters I really was n't interested in doing things I did n't care about.As many previous reviewers have said Martin needs a good editor . REALLY ! The story characters action and descriptions need to be tightened up . I really read the second half of the book because I wanted to get to the end and found myself skimming and skipping over many paragraphs.Unlike other books in the series I really did n't mind waiting to go on to the next chapter . I think that is because the worlds of the North and East or so very different and only vaguely connected to what had became the core location of the book Westeros . Sure some of our favorite characters helped to bridge that gap . But mostly my attention was forcefully and unwillingly jerked from one place to the other . Someone in another review mentioned that Martin displayed attention deficit disorder in this book and I agree.Thankfully the book picks up again toward the end with plenty of surprises cliffhangers and loose ends that beg to be tied up.What I liked The development of Cercie and a deeper understanding of her personality . Tyrion always . Although his story did get a little bogged down in Meereen . The introduction of Penny who begins to help Tyrion develop a different side to himself . Also the introduction of another new character who may have an important role in the outcome of the book . More on Bran and his search for his powers . Theon 's character arc . The ever present coniving Varys . Dany finally getting to ride her dragon.Also Martin has done a good job for a man in writing compelling female characters . Since the time period is similar to the Middle Ages in our time even highborn strong women had a difficult time . Men ruled their world and would use physical force to control them . It 's no wonder they had to manipulate to survive.If you like this series you might also like Sharon Kay Penman 's historical fiction set the real life power struggles in England and France during our own middle ages . The books are much better written with strong character development great story arcs and tighter editing . And truly the truth human history is often better than fiction . The first book in that series is When Christ and the Saints Slept.All that said I liked this book enough to look forward to the next one . I only hope that I and GRRM live long enough to see that day . ",2
"3.5 starsI do n't know how to feel about this book . I do n't know that I like it any better or any worse than A Feast for Crows which was my leastfavourite book of the series thus far . And I was if not expecting at least hoping to like this one a lot better because I so many more of my favourite characters were in this one . And there were certainly parts I enjoyed a lot . But there were a lot of parts that frustrated me a lot of parts that bored me and a lot of parts that felt completely extraneous . It 's definitely in need of judicious editing . I sort of get the feeling that his editors so happy to have him finally declare it finished did n't actually spend much time editing before sending it to print . Apart from a lot of unnecessary repetition and a lot of extraneous material I also found five typos.So overall I 'm giving this 3.5 because I just sort of do n't know what to do with it . There were quite a few moments that genuinely excited me . But there were a lot of things that frustrated me that needed editing or that should 've been held off till the next book . And there are so many things left unanswered so many arcs that began in this book or in Feast that have yet to see any kind of fulfillment whatsoever Well I guess we 're in for another five or six frustrating years until The Winds of Winter comes out.Full spoilerheavy review at ",3
"Excellent story . The sex and language is in line with the story and not overdone at all . Ca n't wait for next book just hope it is not another 6 yrs . ",4
"I could n't wait for the paperback version to come out . I 'm three quarters the way through the book and loving it . I want to finish it but I 'm afraid to see the end . I hope there will be more books in this series . ",4
"Loved immersing myself in the world of The Song of Ice and Fire . A spectacular and huge novel it presents minute details of events occurring simultaneously from the perspective of many main characters in the story . Hated to see it end . Dying for novel Six . ",4
"There is a somewhat humorous analogy hidden somewhere in the sea of black letters about a constipated fat man trying to take a sh ! t . That pretty much sums up this book . Actually Martin 's sea of letters is much like the Dothraki sea.it is a huge expanse of repetitive scenery in which nothing much of significance happens.As a caveat I loved the 1st 3 books . I also love the world Martin has created and do not mind his verbosity in describing characters and settings in detail . I also do not mind the violence sex or fickleness of the world he has created . However Martin 's fundamental problem with AFFC and ADOD is that he does not move the plot forward . He introduces so many new characters that I have an easier time keeping track of the elves names in the Similarion . I understand he is expanding the universe and building up the easternsouthern culture . But so many of his characters are pointless . And by pointless I mean that they are introduced only to die or disappear after having contributed nothing to the plot or storyline . Also Martin feels the need to create an intricate backstory for every characterwhich would be fine if they did something important . Why do I as a reader need to slog through 5 pages of filler backstory for a charter who makes only minor appearances ? Additionally why oh why does he insist upon giving us a morass of characters with similar sounding unpronounceable names ? There is another scene in the book where one of the characters complains that all of the names sound alike and he can not distinguish one from the next..that would be pretty funny except for the fact that it is the very same experience I had reading the book . Martin has an infatuation with arkks zzzts dizarss razakss that all blend together . If you are going to give a character a wierd name at least make the character interesting . I had to constantly look up people 's names because the names were so unpronounceable and characters so forgettable ! And then in the middle of the arkks zzzts dizarss razakss there is a shavepate . When i read that I said WTF is a shavepate ? and again needed to turn to the internet.Another example of Martin 's inability to move along the plot is the storyline of Tyrion in this book . I completely understand what Martin is doing with Tyrion 's character but he just takes so long to do it . I mean the whole river story plotline was utterly pointless . Martin could have just had Tyrion get kidnapped on his way to Pentos and wind up in Merreen with half the pages . Do n't get me wrong I LIKED the river storyline..but it did n't get us anywhere . To make another LOTR comparison it would be like following Sam and Frodo all the way to Mount Doom only to have Frodo decide that the whole ringquest thing is rather silly and he 'd rather throw in with the elves leaving MiddleEarth.Also Martin 's knack for bringing dead characters back to life hurts the story and diminishes the world he has created . I liked the fact that no main character was safe . But if they are all going to come back to life anyways.what 's the point in them dying to begin with ? Then to make matters worse he does n't even use the potential of these undead characters . Catlin Stark as an angry p ! ssed off ghost hellbent on killing all the Freys would have made for interesting reading . Unfortunately there is none of that in this book . There is another character whom we presumed was dead that makes an appearance but all he does is float down a river.Then there is Martin 's equal knack for sucking the life out of characters that we loved . Tyrion becomes little more than a drunken court jester who constantly asks where whores go . No cunning no real witticisms no plotting . Tyrion just does as he 's told and makes an a $ $ out of himself . Dany goes from a powerful intriguing character to a whinny teenager obsessed with screwing bad boys . The Dragons go from being the ultimate chess piece to little more than pets locked in a cagethat escape . Bran turns into a tree.literally . Jon turns down the opportunity to reclaim his rightful place as a Stark and instead decides to count sausages and wildings and does everything possible to pi $ $ people off around him . So much wasted potential . Barristan the Bold is now Barristan the Old . Within 2 books Martin has managed to suck all the life out of all my favorite characters . I did enjoy the Arya storyassassin training but it was done in such a way that it had nothing to do with the plot of the main story . Stannis does nothing but stand in snow and grit his teeth . The Red Woman stares into fires and prays a lot . Cercie gets her comeuppance but in a fashion that is entirely bereft of poetic justice . And then SURPRISE ! Someone else we thought was dead is back again ! Someone gie me an Arrrrgggkra ! At this point I do n't know if I even care how this thing comes out . And now I read it that he intends to write EIGHTnot seven books to finish this story.The most frustrating part of it all is that he has done such a good job of setting up the finale it should not take so long to get there . In order to finish this off he needs the following to occur 1 The Others need to attack 2 Dany needs to invade Westeros 3 Ayra needs to finish her assassin training and return to Westeros on a mission that tears her soul up i.e . she needs to be sent to kill Sansa or someone she cares about 4 Samwell needs to get back to the wall and finish his transformation from coward to unlikely hero 5 Cercie needs to die a painful horrible death 6 The dragonsBranSamwell kill all the Others 7 Tyrion marries his dwarf girl and 8 I do n't even care who gets the iron throne at this point.Despite all this yes I will pony up the dough to read the next offering in this adrift series with the small hope it gets back on course .

"Loved reading all 5 in the series . The story is exciting and humorous . I ca n't wait to get home each night and start reading . ",4
"You will probably come to books 4 and 5 of A Song Of Fire And Ice expecting the books as good as Books 1 and 3 . Or at least Book 2 nobody expects much from bridge books so I do n't think many were offended by # 2 . Wo n't you be disappointed.Frank Zappa had a fun term in the 60 's and 70 's for albums that were obviously inferior to the band 's previous work cranked out just to get the record company off the artist 's back he called it a contractual obligation album . Books 4 and 5 are almost the opposite and Book 5 should never have been written . The whole thing should have been wrapped up in Book 4 . I gave this book one less star than Book 4 because of the way it tortured me.But the author succumbed to the lure of HBO money and so he strung out the series while lacking interesting material or story line subjecting his readers to the worst sort of affliction any author can boredom . Seriously I felt like I was being punished by the end of the first third of Book 5 . I had a heck of a time getting through the entire series to date . Could 1800 or so pages I have a Kindle so it 's difficult to tell exactly feel more like slow death ? MY slow death ? I guess Martin decided that replacing interesting story with sex was an acceptable strategy to fill the pages . This ramps up in each book after Book 1 as he runs lower on ideas . Let me tell you it works as well in book form as it does in poorly written movies sex and swearing takes the place of good plot and character development perfectly does n't it ? That must be why movie attendance is continually dropping the strategy DOES N'T work . At all . I 'll bet a lot of viewers drop out during Season 4 and the series may be cancelled by Season 5.If you 've read Books 13 just wait and go straight to Book 6 . I guarantee you wo n't have missed much . ",0
"After reading this book the only downside is that now you have to wait for the next book in the series . Martins writing is such a high quality that he has spoiled me . I have been trying in vain to get into some other bookseries but I find other writers just are n't as advanced . This guy is a real master of his craft.Some of the criticisms are that not enough happens and that he drags it along and does n't acknowledge some of the cliff hangers left in the last series . That is all true but somehow you cant stop reading . I also think he is beginning to introduce too many characters and it becomes a bit hard to follow at points . Its not the best book in the series but still a very good book and it will draw you in deep . ",3
"Why does the Kindle edition cost more than TWICE as much as the paperback and almost the same as the hardcover ? Greedy ! ",0
"Awesome cant say enough about this series if your a fan this is a must read so many twists now the wait for six ",4
"can not wait for the next in the series to come out and I am so glad that I read these before the show aired . Ca n't wait to see what is to come ! ",4
"I like this book as much as the other four of this series of novels . George Martin has a way of writing in circles with the later books hanging around to meet up with his previous book chronologies which take a certain talent in a writer to pull off well . Ice and fire will go on for a while yet as George is still formulating this tale in his head as he goes on with it . Not that he is likely to be stressed much to be able to come up with more intrigueing tales to spin as he completes the work he has begun here but rather more like data input into a computer program that combines like proofs to complete a theorm or postulation to lay down his own evolution of his imagination . He does it so well that those of us reading his works anxiously await his outcomes with anticipation that I am sure followed JRR Tolkien 's first works of the last century as the turmoil of Europe gripped the readers he nurtured along after his Triology . Patience and wait for the next one to come out . ",4
"Others have done a much better job of describing the story line than I could ever do . I was a huge fan of books 1 2 and 3 . Book 4 seemed to drag and now we hit book 5 A Dance with Dragons.I found this book to be ponderously slow even tedious . There was way too much extraneous BS that had to be slogged through . I do n't see the point in mentioning hundreds of names and battles if those are n't mentioned anywhere else in the bookit just seemed like fluff or filler . It often seemed that Martin was getting paid by the page rather than to produce an excellent book like the first three . There was little and less to like about this book.I kept getting this image of a school boy assigned a 1000 word essay saying all he really needed to say in 250 words and then fluffing it out to reach the required 1000 words . I finished this book but only because I had so much invested in the first 3 . As another reviewer noted its time to tie the loose ends and finish this tale . ",1
"It is an excellent book imaginative and well written . The literary technique of story telling through each of the characters is great to convey the view perspectives and feelings individual by individual . This book like the whole series is great piece of popular literature but the large amount of places and characters make it hard to follow . ",2
"Continued saga . However just wish they would have combined the 2 threads and made two books out of ithaving trouble keeping up . ",4
"Awesome ca n't wait for the next book in this great story . I hope it takes many more to complete the tale.. ",4
"Something is rotten in the state of Westeros 5 chapters into the book and suddenly the writing changes dramatically . Who wrote this and what did you do with GRRM ? What happened to the deliciously brutal content the sharp and crystal clear intent that kept me enthralled for days ? This text is full of rambling inconsequential details floppy prose sophomoric college level fantasy101 dialogue then inexplicably interspersed with phrases displaying flashes of the GRRM ferocity . The master seems to be struggling graceless exhausted desperate . I 'm not ready for yet another fantasy god to fall ill . ",2
"I enjoyed The first three books in the series of A Song of Ice and Fire thoroughly . The characters are incredible and George has really brought them to life securing Ned Stark as the noblest hero Arya as the girl we all want to riseBut in A Dance with Dragons I can see no end . Each chapter jumps to another character and half the book has gone before we return again.I can understand the need or want to include every detail but unfortunately personally I found it tiresome.However I would definitely recommend the book and all in the series . I look forward to the next book and be sorry to say goodbye to the characters when it is The End ",2
"Not bad if you are into this kind of story . Impossible to keep the 4121 characters straight though . I give him 5 stars for always taking the story in a direction i did n't expect . Only one star for how long and confusing the ride is to get there . ",2
"I only stumbled onto this series because of the HBO series . And I devoured the first four books in about a week and a half at the same time rereading the Black Company series from the beginning even as I was in the middle of She is the Darkness . To say I like this particular genre would be an understatement.I fell in love with the series . And that 's been rare and rarer occurrence in recent years . Truth be told in fantasy genre there are a lot of trash out there . But when you love the genre you wade through them in hopes of finding something like this series . Even with the good books after so many of them in so many years they do n't touch you as the early ones once did . But this one certainly did . I can not even remember being as horrified and actually ANGRY at the villains as I was when I was reading through the Red Wedding . When you 're as jaded as I conceit myself to be that 's a treat indeed.So this book was a huge disappointment . In fact this seems another Wheel of Time in the making . At the risk of sounding snobbish that 's not a compliment . Maybe the author does n't mind . Churning books is lucrative and as people invest in characters they forgive much and dutifully buy the next installment . but if you ca n't tell a story in about three books the LotR standard maybe you should n't write . I know the Black Company is like 7 books long but the change of POV narrator keeps the books pretty freshThis book goes nowhere in particular stews like the thin broth the starving masses and there are many in this book huddle around and dissolves into a cliffhanger that actually gives no suspense.Bear with me for a sec . Parents who prep the young ones for daycare in the morning may be familiar with an educational PBS program called Between the Lions . One of the skits is a crudely animated short called Cliffhanger where a mountaineer perpetually hangs from a stunted tree limp on a cliff . Each episode he contrives a way to be rescued and in the end he still ends up hanging from the cliff . The music concludes Cliiiif hanger hanging from the cliff . That 's why he 's named Cliff Hanger ! That 's this book.However I will grant the maps in the beginning of the book are drawn much nicer.I 'll finish this series no doubt . And it can be redeemed with the resolution in the next book . But I finish all my series even the foul unreadable ones . see my Ed Greenwood book review ",1
"This book was great it really does leave you hanging though and I know the author was saying that it will be a year or so before he even has time to write the next book . That sucks but overall this book and the four before it were really great . I love this series the characters are with me whereever I go I ca n't stop thinking about themhow many other books do that ! ? I was upset by some of the things that happened in this book but he 's been doing that to us since Eddard Stark died so it 's a little less painful after thatand what the fuzz is Arya doing ? ! I would highly recommend this series to anyone and everyone in fact despite looking like a meganerd I promote the series to everyone I know . If you get the chance read this series I highly doubt you will regret it . ",4
"I hate myself for buying this book after suffering through Book 4 but I was pleasantly surprised . Flow was much better and less disjointed . It was easier to read because the main subjects are Tyrion Danyerys and Ayra . ",3
"It 's nigh impossible for George R. R. Martin to write a terrible book . So despite the shortcomings of this book it is still better than many others on the market.A Feast for Crows and A Dance of Dragons should have been ONE book . Had they been edited properly removing the constant description of nobles and their armscrests etc . there would have been an almost excellent book.My biggest complaint is the repetitious descriptions and the cliff hangers . Books 1 3 were amazing books ! They wrapped up some plots while furthering the overarching plot . This book unfortunately runs around in circles trying desperately to avoid anything that might have been predicted by fans . So where does that leave things ? Outrageous ridiculous occurrences . That 's where.If you are a fan of this series borrow the book from a friend or a library . There are some fantastic parts in it and we can only hope and pray that the next book will come in a timely manner and make a heckuva lot more sense than parts of this one did.As for the treatment of 'main ' characters I am really disappointed with the arbitrary murder etc . of characters just for shock value . Can we get back to the fantastic meaty books of 1 3 ? Please ? ",2
"Just when you think you have things figured out Martin throws in surprising turn after surprising turn . Sometimes the plot twists make me gasp out loud much to the annoyance of my coworkers . I do n't know what I will do while I wait on book six to be released . ",4
"I 'm emotionally invested in the characters but nothing seems to happen . When some plot lines starts to get interesting the book shifts to a new character . Disappointing I hope they do a better job of the 4th season on HBO . ",0
"Gets crazy long slow and convoluted . Hope he can bring the series back maybe he should work towards shorter books . ",2
"Ca n't wait for the next book . Love your stories Mr Martin keep writing please . I 'll be watching for the next book.Thanks for your excellent characters . ",4
"This book is a real drag . The Slave Bay fauxexoticism was tolerable when it came in small doses but a book dominated by it makes for a grueling read . It takes the first half of this book to catch all of the less interesting characters up with the storyline from the previous book . Very little goes on during this time however . Just angst and indecision 500 pages worth of it . The second half of the book is about ten times better and the last quarter has some genuinely exciting moments . It would take a lot more to make up for the slog that is the first half though . It does n't help that Martin has become extremely predictable . Setups are dangled before the reader and then dashed to the ground does anyone fall for the prospect of the good guys winning even a small battle anymore ? characters are wantonly killed and then resurrected so often that all of the deaths in the book lose their impact . Introducing a character and then killing them before they can do anything worthwhile has become tiresome as well . I 'm sure that I 'll still pick up the next book when it comes out but I wo n't have much in the way of expectations . ",1
"I waited to read this volume because I was disappointed by the previous Feast for Crows.I should n't have waited . Dance with Dragons was a great read and has me back in the saddle with this series . Hurry up Winds of Winter . ",3
"It 's hard not to feel a little bit cheated by onefortwo trick that Martin has pulled with his last two books . A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons feel like a great book masquerading as two lesser ones . And while Dance is certainly more satisfying and certainly less meandering than Feast it 's impossible to deny that the series ' pace has slowed dramatically.With Dance Martin returns to the triumvirate of his Song of Ice and Fire saga Jon Snow on the Wall Daenerys in the East and Tyrion Lannister more or less wandering all over the place . While we get the occasional glimpse of other characters Jaime appears only briefly while Davos ' storyline is unceremoniously dropped halfway through the book it 's these three that drive the plot and spurn the gears in motion towards the series ' endgame.The number of plot threads here are stifling and the weight of Martin 's story becomes heavier with each volume at this rate the last two books will be 2000 pages apiece with print so small you need a microscope to read it . Gamechanging twists are introduced adding more complexity to plots that were convoluted to begin with . More than ever this series feels like a chess game you can practically see Martin moving the pieces across the board positioning every pawn and pony in just the right place in time for the inevitable final clash.While it 's definitely not the best of the series A Dance with Dragons is yet another trophy on Martin 's increasingly wobbly shelf . The worldbuilding going on here is phenomenal and it 's easy to forget the immensity of Martin 's creation there are plots within plots within more plots a wealth fascinating side characters and enough mythology to make Tolkien balk in disbelief . The board may be crowded but the game is as thrilling as ever . ",3
"Of all of the ASOIAF books this was the one I most looked forward to . The title suggested something fabulous was going to happen with Danerys and her dragons and after A Feast For Crows I was eager to learn everything GRRM admitted had been left out of that book.Unfortunately very little actually happens in this book . Admittedly that 's because most of the book is taken up with retelling AFFC from other characters ' points of view but even after all that has been done very little happens . Certainly nothing happens that answers any of the questions and cliffhangers from AFFC.I feel like characters are safe again . At the beginning of ASOIAF any characters no matter how central or important they were could lose their heads . Now GRRM seems to have lost his teeth and is reluctant to kill off any characters even minor ones even when it seems to me at least that thye should have died a dozen times by now Davos any one ? Part of GRRM 's appeal to me was the fact that nobody was safe from him but that 's been lost now . At one point a MAJOR character is missing presumed dead and I never once feared for their safety . In earlier books I would have assumed the worst.This book has the same unfinished feel to it that AFFC did . Important characters are referred to only fleetingly and some not at all there 's no Sansa or Petyr or Samwell those chapters were written but will appear in The Winds of Winter.AFFC is very tightly focues and constrained wheras ADWD is sprawling and wideranging . I think having gone straight from AFFC to ADWD the contrast in the two styles threw me and as a result I did n't enjoy ADWD as much as I did the previous books.The cliffhangers come a little freely in this book . I 've often called GRRM the king of cliffhangers but that 's because I think he is a master at timing them and resolving them timely as well . There were too few resolutions in this book and when they came they were incomplete . YI was left thinking Ok so that character who in AFFC seemed ansolutely certain to die is alive . BUT HOW ? WHY ? The resolutions to some cliffhangers were only given a fleeting mention some only a few words which was frustrating.The evolution of some characters is disappointing . Jon Snow being made Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch would obviously change him but I think he 's changed too much and he 's very annoying . He spends most of the book seeking advice off all around him then ignoring it and doing his own thing.Other characters ' progressions are overly drawn out . I for one wish Arya would hurry up and finih her damn training . I spent most of the book waiting for Tyrion to come into his own and be the conniving devious git he was in the earlier books.Do n't get me wrong this book is brilliant . The characters are all believable and deep and threedimensional the plots are intricately woven and the setting is incredible . By the standards of other writers this book is breathtaking . By the standards GRRM set in his earlier books it 's a little disappointing especially after such a long wait.If I had read the books as they were released I would have been waiting 5 or 6 years between A Feast For Crows and this book and I would have been sorely disappointed .

"I love the HBO series so I read the first 4 books and got this as soon as I could.I noticed this one did drag a bit as did the 4th one but I am still going to stick with it to see who ends upSitting on the throne.This one also has some added twists that were unexpected.Over all a good read . ",3
"this book is one I could n't drop number five is a book about rustling up some feathers for more to begin to the next book . loved it ! ca n't wait for 6 ! ",4
"I literally tried not to finish the book because I ca n't wait to read the next ! So many twists and turns it is great ! ",4
"There is a bit more of the fantasy and magic in this book . However the plot develops the fates of the characters that remain after the first four books in a compelling way especially that of Tyrion Lannister . ",3
"1000 pages of endless dithering . Dany has three dragons but ca n't bring herself to work with them . Too many different characters doing different things with little story cohesion . Just when a chapter actually gets going it ends and you are back to food descriptions sailing marching back storyThere is little development of Bran and Arya both were fascinating possibilities but he just teased us with them.And not an Other in sightAnd the end ? Was the worst part . Made me angry . No more of my money will I spend Mr Martin has lst his way . Good stories have a beginning a middle and an end . He is just milking us now like Terry Brooks and Robert Jordan . ",0
"By the time I got to this book i the series I was caught hook line & sinker . I thought the first couple of books were slow and really only started reading them because I saw the first show of Game of Thornes on tv and was compelled to read these only because Sean Bean played Edard Stark . Sure wish Mr. Martin would hurry up and finish this series . It 's killing me . ",4
"Not as good as the first few but I will hope the next will be better..I have hope the series will be entertaining . ",2
"Come on George get the next one out ! Really ended on cliffhanger but then this series seems to do that . ",4
"If you like ANY of the characters introduced in the previous books just stop after the first one . Here 's a clue everyone that you like dies . You thought you were upset about the Starks ? If you were disappointed after reading the first one but were captivated and had to continue to the next book then the next and you are finally here then I 'm sorry . This fine masterpiece kills off any other character that you fell in love with and introduces a lot of other players aka BListers into the series . It follows along with them only giving you hints of what is going on with the main characters that are n't dead yet . This also makes you continue to fall in love with Jamie . Yes you heard me right . If you 've only read the first book and you are reading this then go away . Others will understand . A man who was banging his own sister a babykiller and traitor becomes even more noble . I hate it but I ca n't stop reading . Screw you George R. R. Martin for sucking me into this series . ",4
"Honestly I could n't believe that the book was over . I got it on Kindle so I was n't really aware of how far along in the book I was . I happened to glance down at the percentage line at the bottom and I was 94 % of the way through the book ! I was shocked . I heard the book was over 1000 pages so how had I got through it so quickly ? And how was the book ending when nothing actually happened ? ? Then it dawned on me all those pages that I had clicked my way through because nothing was happening or because Martin was going into painstaking detail describing someone being burned raped or mutilated . I had unwittingly skipped my way through the book.I was crushed . I had been looking forward to curling up with my favorite character Daenerys and her dragons as the title led me to believe hopefully heading to Westoros to give the evil Cersei her due . though Jaime I had started to grow fond of after that last book But the dragons are chained up except for an exciting scene in the fighting pits and Daenerys has lost the fire she had when she doublecrossed the slavers and burned them all in book three.Tyrion my second favorite character at least since Martin killed offexiledchanged all the Starks does n't do a darn thing the whole book.Jon Snow proves himself totally unfit to command the Wall and gets killed for it . But what else is he supposed to do when apparently there is n't a decent man of the Nights Watch left anyway ? ? There are a whole bunch of new perspectives that I did n't care at all about . The problem with killing off all your main characters is that your readers are no longer emotionally involved in the story . So we readers do n't feel bad about leaving all these newcomers to whatever fate Martin may have in store for them.I never thought I would say this about a thousand page book but it ended too fast . It could have ended even sooner but I kept expecting something to happen so I kept reading . A good editor would have cut this down to 200 pages tops . Frankly I could have done without the whole book except the scene where Daenerys first rides the dragon . ",1
"The entire series is wonderful . You get total surround sound with these books ! The descriptions are so vivid it places you right in the action . Only down side is having to wait till next year for the follow up book ! ",4
"I just finished reading the fifth book in the Song of Ice and Fire series A DANCE WITH DRAGONS . I 'm actually reading the Kindle version of the book George R. R. Martin 's A Game of Thrones 5Book Boxed Set Song of Ice and Fire Series A Game of Thrones A Clash of Kings A Storm of Swords A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons much easier to hold my Kindle Fire HDX than these 1000+ page books.This offering was better than book four A FEAST FOR CROWS but still left a lot to be desired . My favorite characters at least most of them were back in this book but the story stalled . This book is OVER a thousand pages long and I felt that at least half of that was filler.Lots of attention to detail but very little character development in this book . I read the whole thing . All five door stopper books . After all I loved the first three books in the series . But books four and five have soured me on the Song of Ice and Fire experience . I 'm more than a bit leery about reading books six and seven when they come out . I know that I will I have to find out what happens to my favorite characters at least the ones that do n't get killed off right away . GRRM is quite the hatchet man author . I just hope we do n't have to wait too long for the final books in the series . And I hope the spark that was there in books one through three will be back . ",3
"I thought alot about whether to give this three stars or four . I finally decided to give it four because despite the over long details with names and characters I still find myself drawn to the book and enjoying it very much . What keeps me reading it is I care about the characters and want to know what eventually happens with them . They are colourful and entertaining just do n't take the book too seriously . I do however find some of the situations too violent and have to skim through them . All in all though I am really enjoying it . ",3

"Well the long wait for A DANCE WITH DRAGONS is over and we finally get to hear from some of our favorite characters from A Song of Ice and Fire . Jon Daenerys Bran and Tyrion take center stage here in the 'companion ' volume to A FEAST FOR CROWS . And while the story has n't picked up the pace to the level of A STORM OF SWORDS there are definite areas of acceleration and the story is quite obviously being guided towards a specific goal by the masterful hand of GRRM . I know this review will probably earn 10 unhelpful votes within an hour of its being posted simply from being positive but I wanted to present the plus side of what is still in my opinion the strongest epic fantasy currently running the negatives have been adequately covered I would say.First of all so much of what made the first three books in this series so powerful is still present here . The quality of writing and character development the realistic grittiness and coldness of the setting the brutal and painful experiences of the characters that make the reader squirm and the constant foreshadowing of the horrors of the approaching Winter are the tried and true formula for this series and that has n't changed here . One of the most welldeveloped fantasy settings ever imagined only continues to grow with more maps more fleshedout legends and history and more welldefined geography and landscape . The arcane has become more prominent with magic influencing A DANCE WITH DRAGONS more than the previous books but still the gods and their magic remain mysterious forces mostly in the background . If you have loved this series for the wellimagined world and characters you 'll love this book too.Also Martin is finally starting to rein in the expansion of storylines here . It is plain to see the effort to draw many of the disparate stories into a few cohesive groups with an apparent focus on actually getting this megaepic to a point where an inclusive conclusion is possible . Two books ago I could n't imagine how Martin might possibly bring all of these stories to an end but now I can just glimpse a speck of light at the end of the tunnel . Not that I even try any more to predict where this is going . I think you 're fooling yourself if you think you know where this journey ends as major plot twists are still the rule rather than the exception in this series . Who saw Daenerys marrying a Meereneese ? or Theon regaining the hero 's seat ? And for those that say this book does n't progress the story I just do n't see how that argument can be made . Every chapter here serves a purpose to march these characters towards some definite conclusion . Not every chapter serves up battle death or assassination but every chapter gets us to where we 're going . Despite being over 1000 pages there is n't wasted space here.While it is plain to see that this book left a bitter taste in many fans ' mouths What did people expect here ? We knew this was going to take place in the same timeline as A Feast for Crows and we knew it was going to be mostly set up for the final books of the series but people somehow expected worldaltering events and conclusive endings for major storylines ? This series is a perfect example of enjoying the ride for its own sake and letting the end arrive in its own time . While I hope that the rest of the series is completed in a much more timely manner than these last two books in the end those books will be judged based on their own merits not on the amount of time it took them to reach me.In some ways all of the attention and seeming outrage over this fifth installment of the series speaks to the strength the previous books have had . I 'm not sure where the insane expectations for this book came from but just the fact that they exist is a testament to the quality and power of these books . Call me a fanboy but to me this series remains one of the best of all time and A DANCE WITH DRAGONS simply represents one more step along an amazing journey.Martin 's epic saga is able to draw you in mesmerize you beat you up and spit you out as nothing else in literature . Very Highly Recommended ! ! ",4

"I do n't think his writing is wow but it is a fun read and a good yarn . It goes great with the HBO series and it is interesting to see the differences . ",3
"After the somewhat slow pace of the 4th installment this book takes off and does n't slow down . All across the narrow sea plots are laid and destroyed as quickly as you can turn the page . Martin returns to his original style where no one is safe from the sword or dagger and favorites are no safer than common villains . There are also many new characters introduced that will leave you wondering where Martin is going with this epic tale . ",4
"I was just dying to read this book . Lord knows I waited long enough . It is AMAZING and just makes you crave for the author to FINISH THE STORY ! ! ! ",4
"Not Jon Snow . Martin kills all I care about . I honk I skipped every other word to try to see what was going to happen ! ",3
"So when 's this frickin series going to get some closure Mr . Martin ? ? He better write another one because it 's driving me nuts not knowing what 's going to happen next.I also wanted to say that this book is a lot slower than book 4 . In book 4 it seemed like something crazy happened at the end of each chapter . In this one there was a huge lead up and then nothing happenedwtf ? That being said if you read and liked the first four like I did you pretty much have to read this . ",2
"BEING VAGUE SO THERE ARE NO SPOILERS IN HERE I ca n't get enough of these books ! ! ! I tried not to read so fast because who knows when the 6th one will be released . This book in particularly had me reading all the time ! I would go extra subway stops so i didnt have to put it down . The stories are just so captivating and I ca n't wait for the next one to come out ! ! ! ",4
"Hope the next book comes out SOON ! ",4
"great book . I am looking forward to reading the next book . I want to see what people think about the dragons . ",4
"These books are a real treat . I have read them over and over again . It 's amazing how much you pick up rereading these books . There is so much detail in every one . I really hope he continues this series ",4
"I thought this was a pretty good fifth addition to the Ice and Fire series . Aside from some of the other posts I thought even though it left alotI mean alotof open ended stories it also cleared some things up . I am just afraid Martin will never finish the series . I keep hearing Book 6 Winds of Winter is suppose to come out next year and then its the next year . This guys going to pull a Robert Jordan and die before he finishes.If you are into classic fantasy adventures with a twist that are character driven and have a believable exciting plot check out this new fantasy adventureA Chance Beginning Book One of the Shadow 's Fire Trilogy ",3
"I loved the first 3 books . Literally could not put them down . The 4th started getting way too detailed and draggin on . No closure and GRRM keeps introducing even more characters and losing some . This 5th book actually became boring and I lost interest . The story line skips back in time and retelling story lines that have already been covered . I 'll probably read the next one but if there is n't closure that will be it for me . ",1
"Great series of books ! ! ! Ca n't wait till the next book comes out . Surprises in this one . Each chapter has you on edge wanting more . ",4
"Book # 5 carries on with a few new characters and does flashback to some of the important characters in earlier books ",4
"I love getting books online . The price is comparable to what I can get at the local store and I did n't have to get out . The book itself was okay not up to the first 3 though . Anxious for the 6th to come out just to see how in the world R.R Martin can bring this story to an end . ",3
"I must respectfully disagree heartily with those whose reviews state that Books Four and Five move too slowly and do n't move the story forward . As a writer myself I can tell you that sometimes with a work of this scope and breadth the story must move laterally before it can move forward or the quality will suffer . Obviously the author does not intend his work with this series to be a succession of quick shallow AtoBtoCtoDtoE slamdunkyou'redone novels . Any writer can do that . But with a work of this scope it 's important and I think very fascinating to know how the characters each got from C tolet 's call the final book F which I am assuming will be the grand finale . This series is epic and so well done that each time I put a book down I have a hard time returning to reality for a few moments . If you are n't you 're missing the whole point of a work like this.The excellent quality of the author 's writing alone makes Books Four and Five WELL worth reading . And they are quite necessary to the work as a whole . ",4
"Brilliant ! A tourdeforce of storytelling in the fantasy genre ! Daenerys Targaryen the silverhaired dragon princess finds herself ruling the savage lands known as Slaver 's Bay . Jon Snow the bastard Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch unwittingly creates discension among the ranks of the ancient brotherhood . And the kinslayer Tyrion Lannister on the run from bounty hunters makes his way across Essos hoping to find and to serve the Targaryen princess . Through the trials and the hardships of these three main characters the story unfolds . And what a story it is ! Plots are resolved while new ones develop . Characters die new ones are introduced . Chaos and unrest are on the rise in both East and West . Slaves dream of freedom . Magical abilities increase . The three dragons Drogon Rhaegal and Viserion continue to grow stronger and wilder . The supernatural threat from the far North makes itself more prominent as the long winter approaches . And the freedomloving savages known as the Wildlings have come down from the far North to settle below the Wall . While the eunuch Varys continues to create his own brand of disorder within the capital city King 's Landing . Cersei daughter of the great house of Lannister continue in her inept rulership of the Seven Kingdoms . Meanwhile players big and small continue to play the game of thrones.As in the previous volumes the story is told through character point of views . While this gives you intimacy with those particular characters nonmajor characters tend to remain an enigma . Not every reader will appreciate this type of narrative I 'm afraid . But if you can deal with it I think you are in for a long love affair with A Song of Ice and Fire.I do n't think this humble reviewer will need to work very hard to sell you on this book . The previous volumes and the new HBO television series speak for the novel . It goes without saying that anyone wishing to read this novel should only do so after reading the previous four that preceded it . If you are already a reader and would like to join a community of others to share your thoughts theories and ideas with be assured that there are plenty of online communities out there dedicated to the series . Towerofthehand.com is one of the more popular sites along with Westeros.org . ",4
"i really like this series but the battles are a bit tedious . Many characters to keep track of too . But a great story ",3
"A Dance with Dragons continues the story begun in A Game of Thrones . I am completely enamored of the massive story . The many story lines and characters are a challenge to keep straight but it is worth the effort . I began reading the series after I watched the first season of the t.v . show and though I enjoyed the story I felt I was missing part of it . As to be expected the books are far better and have the back stories I was missing . Waiting for the next installment is torture . ",3
"It very well may be that I am not the right demographic for these novelsmy 30ish sons turned me on to them originallyhowever I am a voracious reader & can whip through these puppies in pretty short order.Not this one.Could n't BEGIN to make sense of the geography even with maps constantly felt obliged to refer to the appendix in the back which is not easy with a heavy hardback finally gave up worrying about exactly which character whose name begins with ' A ' was in referenceHere 's what I did like in general terms no spoilers the colorful disparities between the various peoplesWesteros Ghiscari Unsullied etc . the Wall as a character in itself the underpinnings of religious bigotry evidenced throughout.Problem is there is nothing in DwD that advances these qualities past the previous books in fact DwD seems to take particular delight in an absurd level ofwhat ? I just do n't know ! Wading through page after page with no payoff . Why and wherefore ? Boy it sure is COLD ! ! Um yeah.So I can not in good faith recommend it . But I do think the TV version will cure 99 % of these ills . It 's just not a great read . ",1
"The whole middle section of the book about 400 pages could have been edited out which would have left room for more exciting final chapters . Martin seems to favor a flurry of plot twists at every book 's finale which is finebut this time even these felt halfcompleted . Hopefully he 'll listen to reviews and get a new editor for the next book . ",1
"I do n't as yet have anything to say about this book since I have not read it yet I have seen the series and it 's good . ",3
"After the publication of five massive tomes and two seasons of an HBO series based on his books I think it 's tough for anyone who is a fan of fantasy fiction to be unaware of George R. R. Martin 's series A Song of Ice and Fire . A Dance with Dragons is the longawaited fifth installment in the book series and finally brings back those favorite characters missing in the previous volume.If you have n't read through A Storm of Swords book three then just beware that this review may contain spoilers for you . Anyone who has only watched the television series will be lost . In A Feast for Crows book four Martin continued his technique of rotating through different pointofview characters on a chapterbychapter basis . However some notable characters had been left out . Whether you agreed with this decision as explained in an afterward to book four or not the absence of Daenerys Tyrion and Jon Snow rankled with many fans . Although this new volume returns to those characters the events overlap with the timeline from book four creating some d & eacutej & agrave vu as news spreads across Westeros and beyond.Tyrion Lannister 's whereabouts have been a mystery as he is one of the most wanted and recognizable men in Westeros . Accused of murdering Joffrey at his wedding the Imp has also slain his father and vanished from King 's Landing . In the opening of book five he turns up in the free city of Pentos with Magister Illyrio Mopatis who had helped sell Daenerys to the Dothraki in book one . Illyrio 's motives are mysterious but he convinces Tyrion that drowning himself in alcohol is not a worthwhile profession for someone as intelligent as the black sheep of the Lannisters . Tyrion heads toward Volantis with a group of mysterious companions presumably to team up with Daenerys and her cadre of dragons.Daenerys Targaryen sits ensconced as queen of the slaver city of Meereen . Her dragons have grown and can not be trusted to roam free . She is threatened by armies from neighboring cities as well as murderous rebels within Meereen 's own population . Despite her original intent to return to Westeros to claim the Iron Throne as the Targaryen heir she becomes bogged down by the machinations of numerous councilors shady politics and her own uncertainties.In the north Jon Snow guards the wall against the dark threat of wights and beasts of legend . He is also swamped by his newfound responsibilities but deals with them more decisively than Daenerys . Surrounded by wilding prisoners insubordination among his own men and demands from Stannis Baratheon Jon Snow makes his decisions and stands by them.Like the previous books there are so many major characters that if I try to count them I know I 'll leave someone out . Bran travels with Jojen and Meera Reed looking for more information about his dreams . Quentyn Martell heir to Dorne has a secret proposal for Daenerys . The Iron Fleet is on the move but Asha Greyjoy has fled after her failed bid for the Seastone Chair . Davos Seaworth smuggles himself again . Jaime Lannister travels around a bit flashing his golden hand and forging peace in the Riverlands . Arya Stark appears briefly moving on to the next stage of her training and Cersei Lannister must finally face some consequences for her actions.Despite the length of this volume you wo n't see Samwell Tarly Rickon or Osha Sansa Stark Littlefinger or Brienne in this one.One of the most interesting perspectives in this book comes from Theon Greyjoy . No he 's not dead . But after we learn what he has been through it would have been kinder if he had been slain . As disturbing as some of his scenes are I was fascinated to read his interactions with his captor . I have also found someone to hate more than I did Joffrey and that 's a feat.I thought that the pacing of book four dragged so A Dance With Dragons is exciting in comparison . However the dragons play only a minor role and nothing that happens in this book can top the events in the second half of A Storm of Swords . Still the world is as richly drawn as all of Martin 's writing and the story expands to cover a larger geographical area as well as pulling in more characters.The most intricate plot twists and shocking events occur in the north of Westeros . Unfortunately most of the characters in the rest of the world spend the entire time traveling with little resolution to their story arcs . I was also disappointed in Daenerys because I just ca n't make myself care about the plight of the slaver cities and all of her entourage . It 's time for her to ride a dragon to Westeros already ! For fear of sounding too critical I just need to say that this is still a great book . The characters are phenomenal and the writing is better than almost anything else out there . If you loved A Storm of Swords and felt let down by A Feast for Crows A Dance with Dragons takes the series and reinvigorates it with newfound direction and hints at the fire and darkness to come .

"I have liked few books as the first 2 or 3 in the ice and fire sage from George RR Martin what a giant among writers he was in those first books . The last however and in particular this very last one the impression is the GRRM is getting paid by the page or word huge shame . ",2
"I sense the author is getting tired of the story and I 'm frustrated that the book concludes while leaving so many stories untold and incomplete . ",2
"I really am enjoying the series wish I had hours to just sit and read ! Ca n't wait for the others to come out . ",4
"I can not attest to the quality of this book but I can confidently state that this book series has allowed me to watch the worst reality TV known to man since my husband is tied up reading these and not whining about what channel I 'm watching . Score one for the Real Housewives . ",4
"Yikes ! It feels like the author has lost control of the story . By book 5 one would think some of the parts would begin to come together but instead the parts are INCREASING with no sign of ever being united again ",2
"After finishing ADWD my only response was That 's it ? . I love Martin 's writing . The book was an easy read but it felt like one long bridge section building up to something that never happened.I hate to say it but this is reminding me very much so of the last FIVE books by the late Robert Jordan . He too could write a thousand pages of nothing and make you enjoy it . You spend your time on what appears to be a hearty meal only to find that you 've eaten nothing but filler.ADWD should have been a full meal . It was barely a snack . ",1
"A thrilling climax to this series of science fiction . Fun for scifi adult lovers of this kind of fiction . Read the whole series . You wo n't be disappointed ! ",3
"I thought that the first three books of George R. R. Martin 's A Song of Ice and Fire series were absolutely wonderful each one better than the one before . Book four in the series A Feast for Crows was a pretty big disappointment . Crows lacked many of the major characters that fans had come to know and love and Martin promised that as book four and five were meant to take place simultaneously those missing characters would inhabit the pages of book five . Starting book five I was looking forward then to seeing spoiler alert the return of Jon Tyrion and Daenerys among others.A Dance with Dragons is a good book in the series much better than Crows and yet it does n't quite measure up to those amazing first three books . The story is growing and that is both a good and a bad thing . It is good because it is increasing the epic feel of the series and it is introducing us to some interesting new characters and scenarios which is important because George has a tendency to kill off so many of his characters . The story however is also becoming unwieldy and seems in danger of losing focus . I realize that 's probably not the case from the author 's point of view who can see much further than the reader can and yet it is what it is . When a story becomes so big that you ca n't keep up with it you the reader will lose interest . You look at the Star Wars films which had this amazingly epic scope a fight for the galaxy and yet managed to keep the story focused on fivesix main characters throughout.A Dance with Dragons offers some great twists and as noted above some fun new characters . Jon has some major challenges to overcome and Tyrion 's journey may be a highlight of the book though of course Tyrion is perhaps the best character of the entire series . The Daenerys storyline while occasionally interesting left me cold for the most part . The bottom line is if you like the series and like me was disappointed with Crows you will generally enjoy this entry . Here 's hoping book six will return to some of the magic from the series ' beginning . ",3
"this one book 5 is sofast paced ! we are traveling quickly to so many places like a locomotive nearing it 's final destination you can feel the electricity in the air of everything 'coming to a head ' an exciting read ! ",4
"I do n't understand why anyone would give this book less than five stars . Obviously I have read the four preceding novels and loved all of them as well . Kudos to George for writing another awesome episode in the epic that is A Song of Ice and Fire . ",4
"I have just recently read all 5 books from the Game of Thrones and loved them all . I read them back to back so when I was finished experienced real withdrawal symptoms . Ca n't wait for # 6 to come out . But at the end of # 5 I was very upset because someone that I really liked dies . I will not say who hoping that somehow he gets back . . ",4
"I 'm hooked on this series however book 5 can not compare to the first . Still I ca n't put it down . Martin spends too much time however in describing scenessome of which are pretty disgusting as you would imagine in places decimated by war . ",3
"Sure it 's frustrating to wait six years for a book to come out especially if during those six years one builds it up in one 's mind to be the greatest book ever . But let 's face it . Martin is as good as it gets . Most of the perceived flaws of this book were things we all liked in the early volumes complicated setups and fully realized minor as well as major characters unexpected plot twists favorite characters being killed off large chunks of realmedieval setting and traveling . Remember Arya spent much of A Storm of Swords wandering up and down the riverlands . Those who give this book one star are comparing it not to other epic fantasy as should be done but rather to the book they wish Martin had written which raced the whole story to a tumultuous conclusion . But are n't we all going to be bitterly disappointed after the last volume appears that there wo n't be any more ? Let 's enjoy it while it lasts . ",4
"I have no other explanation for Mr Martin 's absurd padding of this narrative than he is paid by the word In what I thought was the final book of five so far at 800+ pages each he starts additional story lines for secondary new characters . But perhaps he needs to introduce new characters since he 's kills off the vast majority of major or sympathetic characters by the time you make it to book four . He goes into unnecessary depth for the heraldry of minor characters and repeats full prayers instead of just saying they recited the evening prayer or morning prayerover and over again . Once or twice is enough I get it the idea.I doubt I 'll be willing to plop down another $ 20 or so five years from now to pick up book six and find out he 's still dragging it out.Wrap it up already ! ",2
"Hoping for the conclusion in book five but I guess I will hav to wait until book six comes out ",3
"Deep deep breath . I have been among the legion of fans who have had to sit the entire wait of YEARS for this book . I got A Feast for Crows on day one and on day one many years later came A Dance With Dragons . I really really did n't want to read it . Bare with me a review is coming but to understand the hate and vitriol in the other interviews this explanation is necessary . Before AFfC Martin 's brilliant novels were running on fewer tighter plotlines and a major revelation awaited in each one . Often more than one major revelation actually . Then AFfC came out and despite being warned we all cried foul to see that many of our favorite characters simply were n't involved . So there we were having finished a book that seemed to have shorted us a bit with a promise of the next book to be delivered after a short wait . Six years later we get what is essentially AFfC part 2 with an addendum containing the beginning of the next book.We started this leg of the journey very angry with AFfC and over the years and delays we became more angry . We began to lose hope that the series would finish at all . And if nothing else that sort of passion and hopelessness should let you know just how amazing this series is at connecting directly into you . Expectations were high . Just four months shy of six years after AFfC it 's here A Dance with Dragons . And that six years is the problemA Dance with Dragons brings back the missing characters from AFfC and as it begins there is nothing to complain about . Taken as a whole the book is clearly the middle of the road between acts two and three of the story entire . Having that in mind I think you 'll enjoy it very much . Especially if you are a true fan of the series . So those of you who are and who may be thinking about not buying you know you will eventually go ahead and buy it . It 's Martin . It 's his writing it 's his characters and it 's the same world you fell in love with over the rest of the four books . Stories as long as this have parts that may not seem to do much but that 's because the major consequences of the things that happen in A Dance wont be fully known until the start of the NEXT book . Dance is the literary equivalent of the story slowing down to stretch it 's legs for the sprint . But it being written by Martin as long as you keep that in mind you can take a longer view and realize exactly what it is he 's setting up . And what he 's setting up is a MASSIVE shakeup in nearly every political religious and even supernatural facet of the world he 's made . He 's laying the path for events that will change things to such an extent that I think it may turn out to be unprecedented in fantasy literature.Let that sink in for a bit.A Dance With Dragons features less epic style action and more personal small conflicts . It takes the characters away from what they know and it puts them in the thick of places they might not even belong . It 's a growing experience for each and every character in the book . The problem is that these new paths are not the end of old paths.You see we as fans have wanted conclusions to some very major story points we collectively assumed that Martin would n't be expanding his story any further only staying with what he 'd begun and starting to wrap it up . He did n't do that . So all of us who were reading with baited breath to find out for instance about Jon 's parents were left in the dark . We end a Jon chapter and find that a new character is being introduced and it seemingly has nothing at all to do with what was hinted at before . This makes us angry.But take a deep breath . The reason we were all here in the first place is precisely because of Martin 's writing . This man undoubtedly knows what he 's doing . He 's 5 of 7 into what I think is going to be recognized as possibly THE fantasy series for mature audiences . We should not be angry that he did n't write what WE would have written . It 's not our story to finish . It 's his . And you can even take it a bit further . Reread the first books and you 'll notice how many small hints are dropped about Valyria then come back to Dance to find that there is now a journey TO Valyria . I believe he 's trying to tie up more than just the stories of the great houses we 've been following . I think he 's trying to tie up the bulk of his entire mythos by the end . And read more . Notice that until Dance with Dragons we had no idea that there would be a SINGLE commander of the white walkers and the things beyond the wall and that it may be the very one who is training Bran . We did n't know the people of the forests were alive.No I think Martin is right on track . I think he 's doing brilliantly . I think I 'm more than happy to give my patience and trust in him not leaving us in a lurch.A Song of Ice and Fire will have an ending . Please just take a deep breath and realize how stupid it would have been of him to start tying off all those incredible loose ends with two more books to go . Westeros just took a deep breath and I took one with it the next book will be the beginning of the plunge and the last will be the plunge itself.But this book . This one stands as a worthy addition to the story . It did n't go precisely where all of us wanted in fact it spent a lot of time in a place that was as unpleasant for us as it was for a few of the characters in it . But there is a real sense of the slow beginnings of inertia near the end . When even more characters start popping in and when the dual storylines running parallel in AFfC and ADwD finally do end you can feel it start to move . By the end I was left feeling that all of that spreading out of story and plotlines and character arcs was about to start converging . Dance along with Feast are very singular events in publishing . They only came about because we the fans demanded Martin not skip forward several years . We wanted to know what happened . And he gave it to us . The last two books were those written precisely so that we would n't feel cheated . Martin cared so much about fan outcry that he wrote two extra books . I for one am greatful . The more I read from him about this world the better.For five books now we 've said it along with all the Starks Winter is Coming . By the end of this book winter is here . And NOW the fun begins . Just do n't take another decade to finish this George . Please . ",4
"I love a Song of Ice and Fire but this book was a little slow and it did not seem like much happened compared to other books in the series . The wait time between books is also a killer because who knows when he will finish them . ",4
"Another great book in this series . Setting pace character development all wonderfully done . I hope we are n't kept waiting long for the next one ",4
"Now like most other Song of Ice and Fire fans I am willing to admit that the last entry in the seriesA Feast for Crows A Song of Ice and Fire Book 4 was not my favorite and that it got me worried that Mr. Martin had gotten a little too ambitious in his storytelling . This latest entry has restored my faith that he knows what he is doing . Taking us back to just after the end ofA Storm of Swords A Song of Ice and Fire Book 3and continuing the stories of characters who were left out of the last entry Jon Snow Daenerys Targaryen Bran Stark etc.A Dance with Dragons A Song of Ice and Fire Book 5comes back to the most interesting characters and storyline in the entire series i.e . the Wall and Daenerys ' rise to power . Like all of the previous novels all of the characters are well fleshed out and engaging and Mr. Martin 's patented cliffhanger chapter endings always leave you wanting more . And knowing what happened in the last entry helps make this one all the more enjoyable not knowing what was going on elsewhere was one of A Feasts biggest problem I felt . The wait for this fifth entry was well worth it . I will say that I still fear that Mr. Martin has become too ambitious in his storytelling and I fear that he wo n't be able to finish the whole tale in two novels after this . But however many novels it takes I will enjoy them just as much as I have enjoyed this one . ",3
"I realized they are just reselling the same bloated mess that was WoT in a different format hyperextended for maximum cash . This is n't art folks . If you think it is I am here to tell you that you have been duped . Yeah Robert Jordan could have been the new Tolkien . Instead he died with people thinking he was a shill . The same is going to be said here like it or not.Martin has lost the ability to write a decent story over the two decades I guess it takes to complete what more than likely in the author 's original plans was a proper 3 or 4 book series in total . DoD is nothing more than a plodding midtier adventure that leaves more loose ends than it solves . Sound familiar ? I bet WoT could have made a 10 book series if Jordan was an actual artist with conviction . I 'm tempted to say WoT had the best original plans a midway point between Tolkien and Martin but RJ really flew the coop . Martin has n't quite arrived in nutterville but he might as well be a couple minutes from town at this point.This is what happens folks your original and more than probably excellent plan for the trilogy LOL is force fed a bunch of 'corporate corn ' for weeks . Hell years even . and then the trilogy simply ca n't cover the world building and character killing . Well oh well right ? OH NO . Now we are writing seriously and seriousness demands thousands of pages that do n't have any connection to the original story but to prolong it . And then the side stories become part of the main story . And then . barf.The printers start printing money.My advice is do n't ever get into these 'novels ' . Ever . They are just another crack addiction that goes awry . I honestly do n't even care that I have never finished this or the Wheel of Time . I probably will not ever pick them up again . That is exactly how much these authors have erased my memory of the good times I used to have with them . Horrible.I am also here to tell exactly how these writers function . They are not great writers for they fear the ending of their 'baby ' . Great writers continue on through their best work and keep doing other things they keep innovating on their own style or they stop writing . Well he may have stopped writing for a bit I do n't really know but what I do know is that Martin is now in full on 'Soap Opera ' mode just like Jordan turned to around book 6 of WoT . This means he is simply wanking away whatever comes to mind at this point while following a loose structure . And while Jordan 's work got him through book 6 some say to book 9 before people started to question what was going on Martin has the detractors firmly in tow after Book 4 . That is n't a good sign.And I HIGHLY doubt Martin keeps as much information about storylines as Jordan did . meaning this will be an even bigger mess than WoT unless they can get a really good editor in here . For those that do enjoy this stuff great . No problem have a good time . But after being burned by WoT MAJORLY I do n't step into these time sinks lightly . And this one has way too many parallels to WoT . Not only that he is running out of decent characters to kill and his world building is still second tier behind Jordan and Tolkien . I like his dialogue more often than not but I can not support these guys who just do n't have the vision required to complete their sagas in a proper timeframe WITHOUT all the egregious fat and gristle .

"Another amazing book by George RR Martin in the Song of Ice and Fire series . This book definately continues the story at the same pace and standard as Martin 's earlier books . I ca n't wait for another one ! ",4
"The first three books of the Song of Ice and Fire are three of the best fantasy books you will ever read hands down they are brilliant . Book four to me was the equal of say Godfather III took years to get and was a major let down . Years later we finally get book 5 much better than book 4 has some really cool moments but ultimately does not move the series forward or any closer to a finale . There is a point as a reader where you can only read so many 1000 page transition novels think of Robert Jordan . Is it fair to put a loyal reader through that ? Jordan wrote how many transition novels and never finished his series unfortunately I think starting with book 4 George RR is going that route . I will not give anything away here or spoil anything the bottom line is the book is a big improvement over book 4 but ultimately is frustrating in that new characters are introduced our old favorites do not really move forward for most of the book .

"Three star average review ? For one of the bestselling fantasy books of all time ? At the end of the day it 's important to the casual reader of these reviews to realize what 's really going on here.This series is extraordinarily important in the fantasy cannon it breaks new ground and is well written and very entertaining . It is also somewhat protracted and to be fair books 4 & 5 stall a bit . The fan base is incredibly invested in this series and many feel betrayed by the slow pace of book releases leading to a backlash of sorts by a vocal minority nevertheless this minority all buy the books . People love these books they live for these books and if they 're even slightly disappointed in any aspect of a book they feel betrayed.The comparisons of George RR Martin and Robert Jordan and his shameless protraction of the Wheel of Time books is grossly unfair Jordan 's books were a rambling mess Martin 's books are detailed but well designed and coherent . Could the series have been finished in 34 volumes instead of the planned 7 probably but the protraction never feels wanton or obvious.At the end of the day the success of these books in regard to the sales numbers speak for themselves . This is one of the best Epic Fantasy series of all time and will be ranked along with Tolkien Donaldson and McCaffrey . ",4
"Do n't bother to even read this book . Wait two more and u will still find everything in the same place . I must agree with the other reviews I too am invested in the series but I have fallen out of love with this whole dragged out mess ",0
"Was this the best book Martin has written to date ? No definitely not . Was it worth a read ? I think so . Was it as bad as a lot of people say ? I do n't think it was all that bad . I figured that the first books that Martin wrote were all setting the stage so that this book would be more action packed I was very disappointed in that aspect . There were a few shocking things that happened in this book although you had to wait quite some time for them . Some people did think that the shocking things that did happen were kind of pulled out of thin air flashes in the pan that had no set up prior to them . I can also see where they 're coming from when they say that the POVs of Daenerys and Tyrion were a bit of a let down Daenerys who has thus far been a strong character is indecisive and Tyrion who has been charming and clever is crying drunk mess . It 's true this book has a lot of let downs but I think it also has a few redeeming qualities . Well I 'm glad I read the book . I think it 's worth the read as long as you are n't expecting a masterpiece . ",2
"After waiting six years for this book I found that I did n't dive in and devour it like previous releases . I think after waiting so long I felt like it could stand to wait a few days more without killing me.The Kindle edition starts right at the Prologue which I found really annoying because George RR Martin gives a little foreword about the chronology of this book . If I 'd read that first I might not have been so confused about the first few chapters I read . You have to realize that the first half of this novel is the other half of A Feast for Crows so you end up reading a lot of overlap . In fact one Jon chapter reviews exactly the same scenes as a Samwell chapter in Feast which really annoyed me because I 'd just reread the first few Feast chapters so it was like reading something twice.That being said it was great to finally learn more about what happens to Tyrion after his escape from King 's Landing and more about Bran in the north . I think I 've figured out who Coldhands is ! The book delivers several shockers revealing new characters and bringing back several old ones . In direct contrast to his murderfest in Storm of Swords he goes on in Dance to prove that you should n't believe someone is dead until their body is being packed up by the Silent Sisters or they stop having chapters . Martin has become really good at a very slow ascent of a character 's chapter culminating in a serious cliffhanger then moving right on to someone else driving you completely mad . The cliffhanger ending works well for linear perspectives but when you 're switching off to someone else in the next page all it does is drive your readers crazy.With this book Martin seems to be using chapter titles as a method of character evolution using different descriptions and names for the same characters . I personally found it kind of annoying but in the case of a certain ironborn it did a lot to mark his progression through the story . There were several character perspectives that I just did n't care about and I do n't really know what the point of it was . For instance the Prologue . I thought it would serve some grander purpose later in the book but I think it could have been accomplished with a simple paragraph in a Bran chapter . I found myself falling asleep during the Victarion and Quentyn chapters . Seriously even if it 's setup for later it just felt like fluff.Being that this book is called A Dance with Dragons I expected practically every Dany chapter to be like her second to the last one and I expected her last one to end in a fiery blaze of Targaryen glory . Instead I was given a rather hohum ending to a season of The Bachelorette Meereen Edition.The book is very Joncentric with something like every 2 chapters being about Jon . While I did n't mind this I think it could have been condensed a little . Barristan chapters were particularly enlightening because he is so old and knew so many people from the past that we have only heard about in stories . Reek chapters were fascinating and Martin shows his unique ability to make you feel for a character you previously completely despised as with Jaime . Sansa is completely absent from the book.While there are some truly magnificent chapters in the book and I 'm happy with the advancing he did of the story it 's not the best book of the series by far . I 'd rank it second to the last beating out only Feast for Crows . Still I give it 4 stars because I did like it . It just was n't perfect . ",3
"I am a fan of the Song of Ice and Fire series I even think Feast for Crows is a brilliant book unfortunately I can not say the same about A Dance with Dragons . To be short the fifth book in the series can not be compared to the previous four . Sadly I have to say A Dance with Dragons kills almost all the forward momentum of the first four books The following sections contain spoilers beware.What 's wrong with this book ? Almost everything . First of all it was a very bad idea to go back to the time of the events of Feast for Crows . The first half of the book covers the same period as the Feast for Crows . This part is simply boring . The second half of the book is more interesting but the events we are told about simply do not fit into the big picture . The worst part about A Dance with Dragons is that almost all the characters lost their wits and their behavior is simply stupid . Let 's discuss some details . Daenerys the change in her in the book is just nonsense her decisions are simply stupid the wise and compassionate future queen of Westeros became a gullible hysterical lazy and wanton girl . And Meereen is not interesting it is simply annoying all the characters we get to know in this city are selfish and disgusting and anyway who cares about the Slavers ' Bay ? Does it have any connections with the main story ? It has none . At least in the end Daenerys leaves this wretched city Quentyn Martell his story for me was the biggest mistake in the whole series . We read a lot about Dorne and the scheming of Doran Martell in the previous book . At the end of the previous book it was revealed that the big secret is that the prince of Dorne is sent to Daenerys . Wow it could have been interesting Major spoiler here all this fuss about Dorne the sand snakes Arys Oakheart and so on what is the result of all this ? Quentyn dies without any result whatsoever he and all the Dornish scheming achieved absolutely nothing ! This part is really frustrating because why invest a lot into a detailed and good story ? Just to give an abrupt and stupid ending ? I am not against killing off the characters I was blown away by the Red Wedding because it made sense Quentin 's story is simply unnecessary . Prince Aegon did this new twist in the story add anything to the big picture ? No on the contrary . The more new characters we have the more likely it becomes that a lot of side stories will not be wrapped up at the end . Are Aegon an his companions interesting characters ? Unfortunately the answer is no . Up until this fifth book Martin managed to avoid most of the fantasy clich & eacutes Aegon and his team is simply too bland and mostly unnecessary and clich & eacuted the good but spoilt prince with his loyal and wise counselor is one of the biggest fantasy clich & eacute . Was the story in such a dire need for another contender for the iron throne ? I could continue with all the characters in the book none of them moved forward . Even Tyrion who is still the best character in the book became shallow . And what about this girl dwarf ? Really ? Yes I am angry with this book because the first four books were masterpieces this one is ordinary . I can not give it more than two stars . ",1
"You know how a good movie comes out then there 's a sequel at was n't as good and then each successive one has a little less ? This series is kind of like that . The first three books were good # 4 less so and this last one is kind of meh . The book does n't finish up any of the plotlines and it really feels like the author is just tossing things artificially into the plot to keep the series going . ",2
"i 'm halfway through and it already deserves a five star review . the 6 year wait was worth it i just hope he does n't take another 18 years to finish the series ! ! EDITyeah.. ^^^^^^^^^ that was wrong . i just finished the book today . i 'm not going to paraphrase the entire book or plot lines that i enjoyedhated . this book is to put it simply poorly written.the first 3 books left me dying to read more . the fourth book was generally uninteresting but i plowed through it twice and upon 2nd reading realized that the 2nd half of the book was actually worth rereading . this book though i 've only read it once makes me wish i never picked up the series in the first place.the writing style has gone downhill as if GRRMs voice has become a caricature of itself and all editing has gone out the window . i was terribly excited to see all the characters i missed in AFFC at first and anticipated big meetups and possibly an explanation of ANY mystical elements thus far . i was disappointed yet again . to the people who are saying well it 's just the 2nd half of AFFC it 's a good 'transition piece . ' does that mean that the 2nd half of a mediocre book should be just as if not more mediocre ? i guess in a strange way that does stand to reason but GRRM was so good at bashing expectations ! now it seems like he 's a one trick pony using tiny cliffhangers at the end of chapters to keep us interested . characters repeating themselves incessantly . even multiple characters having the same memories of things verbatim..it would be one thing if the next book will come out next year but as we 've heard GRRM is n't even starting the next book for another year . so it will be at LEAST 23 years before the next book comes out and quite possibly a decade or more before the series is concluded . i needed a little more out of this book to keep me interested . sorry GRRM but i do n't know if i can ",1
"I 'm kind of over Mr Martinway too wordy way too many characters too much graphic violence and sometimes quite boring.I will continue to watch on HBO whenever it comes on again but will probably not purchase another of his tomes . ",2
"Great read but be prepared to study the genealogies as usual . Glad there is n't a test over them ! I enjoy the stories but the constant flipping back and forth between characters can be confusing ",4
"Do n't bother wasting your time if you fell for the drawnout teaser that was book Four . None of the characters you were following through the first three books and even into the fourth move along here so there 's no point in reading it . Want to find out what happens to Bran and his siblings ? Jon apparently winds up dead killed by his inner circle . Same fate as too many other characters ho hum The other families ? All those yarns at loose ends are just left fluttering.Yes that 's correct . No satisfying conclusion awaits and about two dozen NEW characters are added instead as if the author got tired of the old ones from the first four books and rather move along and then wrap up their stories he just ignored them completely . Not sure which is more disgusting the sloppy and tedious writing or the utter disrespect to the readers he 's dragged along through thousands of pages previously only to arrogantly leave hangingas if we are all going to rush out for his next book to get what we did n't in this one . Sorry . Fool me once I might try again . But the final two books were so worthless and the quality so lacking there is n't any point in bothering with another.Such a shame . These characters and story premise deserved an engaged writer who cared about his craft not someone just filling pages with the same tediously repetitious situations as if he 's tossing darts at a page of the following options violent and senseless death introduce new character boring sex scene gratuitous violence introduce new character implausible escape introduce new character or feast scene .

"I 'd like to start my review by mentioning all the positive things about this series which keeps me reading . GRRM has created compelling characters in Sansa Arya Jon Snow Jaime Lannister Tyrion Lannister and Daenerys Targaryen and I 'm dying to know what happens to them and how they come out of this novel . So every time I 'm reading something about them I 'm happy.I 'm not so happy with this novel as a piece of writing . The problem is that the structure of the story has become slack and we have a situation with multiple characters and multiple plotlines which necessitates long waits between each point of view character to find out what happens next . For example poor Sansa Stark finally left the Eyrie with her unclebymarriage Petyr Baelish at the end of A FEAST FOR CROWS but nowhere is she to be seen in A DANCE WITH DanceWithDragonsDRAGONS . So I 'm still wondering what happened to her . Instead the plot has become bogged down in too many minor characters and their dealings and so the momentum of the story has crawled to a halt.What made J. K. Rowling 's Harry Potter series so successful was that each book was structured around a year at Hogwarts . Unfortunately A DANCE WITH DRAGONS like A FEAST FOR CROWS has lost its structure so one reads and reads with no real sense of where this story is going to end up . And so the arc of tension is either sagging or absent.I hope that GRRM will do a couple of things with the last two books in the seriesDitch the prologues . I have no idea why ADWD started with Varamyr as it seemed to have little bearing on what followed . The opening would have been much stronger if we had been plunged into the scene where Tyrion is on a boat escaping Westeros just after killing his father at the end of Book Three.Edit out the minor characters and make the book lean and mean by just focusing on the lives of the main characters that we have grown to know and love.I would love a scene in which Tyrion meets Daenerys especially as their encounter in ADWD was such a copout . I want to see Tyrion confront his sister and brother . I want to see who ends up on the Iron Throne . And I want to find out what happens to Bran Arya and Sansa . Do they ever see each other again ? As far as I 'm concerned I would be happy NOT having to wade through stuff about another unscrupulous sellsword or about Theon Greyjoy and his family or about the Dornes . Frankly I 'm no longer interested . Three stars . ",2
"If you are a fan of A Song of Ice and Fire do n't cheat yourself pick this book up . Is it the most exciting volume in the series ? I do n't believe so . Is it an excellent piece of fiction ? Absolutely.Martin 's writing maintains its beautiful imagery and graceful flow . The dialogue is excellent as always and his characterbuilding remains unsurpassed . These qualities lend ammunition to his critics however . In order to build a deep rich world with characters that seem real and stir your emotions Martin must spend time exploring subplots private thoughts and reflections . There 's just no way around it IMO . Personally I do n't think there should be.This volume is not the battlefilled action volume of a Storm of Swords . It 's much more contemplative and thoughtevoking . That does n't mean it 's worse just different . It does advance the plot but not incredibly so . It 's unrealistic to expect that this book ever would when Martin has been clear time and time again that this book runs tandem with AFFC.I think the biggest spark that has led to so much disdain for this volume is the fact that Martin SPOILER ALERT is willing to kill off major characters . Anyone who seriously holds this against this book is a fool . Martin has shown since AGOT that he is more than willing to kill off major characters . This has set him apart from his peers . Is this a good thing or a bad thing ? That 's irrelevant at this point . If you do n't like it then you should have stopped reading by ASOS.Book reviews ultimately should weigh most heavily whether the author has succeeded in maintaining the reader 's attention and investment of time . Martin has done so . I still remain in awe of his writing talent and feel genuine happiness and sadness for his fictional characters . That 's the mark of GREAT writing . ",3
"No Spoilers ! Book five starts out where book four left off but in a weird kind of way . You will go back to events that have already happened but narrated by different characters . It will show you what they were doing and feeling to events that have already been told in book four . It did include one of my favorite characters so it was okay by me . Mr. Martin surly makes audacious moves with his characters and there are no rules to his writing . He has created an Epic fantasy world with Game of Thrones . His fantasy world is created with vivid detail of time places and events . At times it is hard to keep all the Houses in order . Winter has yet to come so I am still hanging in there for the finally . I also watch the HBO hit series . All in all a great piece of work masterly crafted ! ",3
"I have never been so disappointed and angery after reading this entire series as when I was served up this crappy ending . The author has cheated his readers . ",1
"I became a fan after reading the first book in the series . It was not surprising that I devoured the next two and waited anxiously for book number four . Like many others I was very disappointed with A Feast For Crows and was hoping that the author will compensate with this book . The author kept saying that most of the popular characters will be covered in this book so the expectation was even higher.Now after reading this book I must admit I am not eager to know how this story ends or whether there is going to be another book closing the series . Although the writing style is good as ever the plot does not advance and the few shocking turns during the plot are undone by simple kids realms solutions where the heroes never die . That is also the reason why the ending which was quite extreme did not leave a taste of wanting to find out more since the hunch is that it will be resolved with a turn that will take all the surprise awayJust to convey the level of distrust I now hold I can say that when I read in the previous books that Bran and Rickon were killed I stopped reading having the saddest feeling I had from a book and I could not stop talking about it with my wife for 2 days . In this book however when anything like that happened to a character I like very much I did not feel anything and I just did not care . I only checked the number of the page I was at to know how long more I need to endure this reading.A marvelous series that started in the most promising way just crashed head on into a concrete wall . A shame . ",1
"I am not sure if Martin has simply lost interest in this project has become distracted or simply been overwhelmedOr if editors have helped or hindered him . Though I think it is telling that one of his editors admits he 's left a book 's worth of material on the cutting room floor.The book somehow manages to feel both too meandering and too rushed at the same time . And I ca n't help but feel that some of his experience in writing scripts for the HBO series has rubbed off on how he writes the books . In fact I 'm certain of it.If so we 're all the poorer for it.I ca n't imagine events being wrapped up in two books given what he chose to spend so much time on in this oneand we 'll have to wait ten years to find out.Martin was probably a bit too cruelly gratuitous in his cliffhangers . Reading this book might be a much different experience as part of a completed series but taken alone is painful and not as rereadable as the first 3 books . ",1
"I 've read all of the books this far and I have to say that I think Mr. Martin is just getting long winded I have STILL not finish this book because it is just so long and so hard to follow . I keep putting it down and reading something else then I pick this back up and read a few chapters get frustrated again and start the cycle all over again ",2
"I Think Martin has stumbled on to a rare psychological phenomenon that baffles the mind & robs people of all sense of discernment and good taste . Apparently if you read an amazing book and then are forced to wait multiple years for the continuation the mind begins to break down . Especially if said continuation does n't match your expectations.Thankfully I started reading Game of Thrones book 1 in November 2011 and today February 2012 I 'm almost done with A Dance With Dragons . So it seems I 've been spared the ravages of this cruel mental disorder . However I feel for those of you waited and waited.. who built up elaborate fantasies of what you think should happen regarding your favorite characters only to pick up A Feast For Crows to discover they 're not there ! .. The first brain cells began to sizzle . You then fantasized more while reading about these strange new characters complicating annoyances within your previously simple fantasy . Then waited years once again ! Finally you got your hands on A Dance With Dragons.. only to find that your final creation did n't match the creation of the author ! Ahhhh.. SIZZLE ! Well maybe you should write your own book.Seriously this book is as impossible for me to put down as all of the other books in the series . I do sometimes skim through lengthy descriptions of Dornish ham and blood sausages and Amber Gold ale upon which they 're usually breaking their fast.. simply because it makes me hungry and thirsty for unhealthy stuff . Ale for breakfast ? Come on ! Other than that I love it . If you can read one book after another without waiting years in between all should be well.I seriously do n't know what novels I can read after this . I 'm ruined . ",4
"George R. R. Martin has been compared to Tolkein primarily because he borrows heavily from Tolkein 's mythology and openly admits as much . I prefer to think of Martin as Tolkein 's evil twin wherein THE LORD OF THE RINGS was ultimately an optimistic lifeaffirming journey A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE is its nihilistic counterpart determined to present a bloodsoaked world where anything and everything canand willhappen.A DANCE WITH DRAGONS Book 5 moreorless occurs simultaneously with Book 4 though it overtakes it in the last couple hundred pages . We 're presented here with characters missing from the previous book Daenerys ruling a city besieged by outside armies and murderers within Jon Snow Lord Commander of the Watch slowly beginning to understand the terror that is approaching and the evils he must face within his own command Theon Greyjoy betrayer of the Starks has become captive of Ramsey Bolton and lives in quaking fear of his captor 's shadow even as Bolton makes plans to bring rival King Stannis to his knees Tyrion Lannister heading across the sea a fugitive and kinslayer joined with a band of men who are more than they appear Quentyn Martell Dornish Prince on a secret mission of his own . These paths and more will converge and blood will spill fire will eruptand yes winter is coming.If DRAGONS has a flaw it 's this by now there are so many darn characters it 's hard to care about all of them . Martin 's world is intricate and wellplanned he covers every detail he possibly can which can be a bit tedious in spots okay a lot of spots . The story has to be this complex of coursethat 's what helps ground everything even the magic in reality . Thus it 's a forgivable flaw though readers will certainly find the going a little slow in spots . Tension still mounts of courseif anything that 's what keeps fans coming back where is Martin going with this ? No one really knows except Martin himself of course but we can be certain on one thing it 's not going to be a happily ever after . ",3
"I am not giving it 5 stars as in tying in the many characters involved at this point it jumps around but the overall story is well depicted and amazing in content . I just found the first 4 books were structured a little bit better and flowed a little more naturally . ",3
"Well if you liked the first books you 're going to like this one Even if I found that fewer and fewer of the main characters remain interesting there are still enough interesting characters to make the book worth reading . ",2
"It never ceases to amaze me how these books hold my attention ! From the fist book through this one and even to the excerpt I simply ca n't put them down ! The story lines are true the citing of occurrences from past books and chapters are as seamless as real life ! ! Alas now the wait begins for the next one ",4
"The critics say A Dance with Dragons is vastly more satisfying than its predecessor . I call bull . Feast for Crows was n't great but this one is barely any better . I can not imagine fans waiting the six years between books 4 and 5 only to be rewarded with this tiresome heap . Sure a few of the more interesting characters are featured but their story lines are tedious compared with the earlier books . Preserving Crows and Dragons as a single book which was the author 's original intention would have prevented so many problems . All the extraneous standing around and chattering gone . While we 're at it let 's get rid of all the unnecessary characters too . Gawd I hope Martin has a plan for these little side plots.A Dance with Dragons does end on a relatively strong notenot great but stronger than the 600+ pages preceding itand that 's saying a lot because I was ready to say goodbye to Westeros for good . Hopefully Martin has everyone carefully positioned to drive this story home in the final two books because I do n't have the patience for any more meandering . Still I fear that even with a superior series ending A Song of Ice and Fire has already suffered irreparable damage . ",2
"It 's bittersweet to post this review because it means I 'm finished reading all 5 published installments of George R. R. Martin 's epic series . I 'm really excited to have time to read other things and do other things but I 'm also going to miss reading about these characters daily so much ! I 've also made so many new blogging friends through this series because clearly it has affected a LOT of people readers and television watchers alike ! .Fortunately at least two more books have still yet to be published in this series because unfortunately I did n't feel like this book ended the month with a bang as I was hoping it would . Do n't get me wrong I loved it and I know that this book was a favorite for many of you however it fell a little flat for me similarly to A Feast for Crows aka AFFC . While I feel like the details are what make this series so incredible in many ways there may have been too much detail in AFFC and A Dance with Dragons to the point where the story did n't move forward as quickly as I expected and needed ! . I wish Martin would have compacted both of these books and made them work as one unit as originally intended . I have absolutely no idea how he would have done this coughcut out the Greyjoyscough lol but many of the newer characters still did not resonate with me as a reader.Now do n't get too angry with me but I was especially disappointed with Dany 's storyline I felt like she did nothing but spin her wheels in this book ! ! I 'm sure if I look deeper there 's some great powerful explication on her need for stability to stop moving her fears and doubts . But as a reader I wanted action ! I wanted Dany to keep moving forward and keep stringing bells in her hair ! I need to keep reminding myself how young she is and how vulnerable she is but I also have confidence in her as a reader and want to cheer her on . I really wish I could go into better depth on Dany but I do n't want to spoil anything at all for those of you who have n't yet read this book.As I mentioned in my review for AFFC even the worst George R. R. Martin book is still probably the best of 100 books chosen at random . While I did n't connect with this story as deep as books 13 in the series I still enjoyed the experience of reading tremendously and loved the characters . It was exciting to follow Tyrion 's story and some of the new characters were especially promising to meet like REALLY exciting to meet . I ca n't stress that but I ca n't say more . After reading this book I am also excited to read theories about the future of the series without being spoiled . The beauty of Martin 's writing is that you can never anticipate what is going to happen next . This epic tale is truly an adventure to read and discover and I hope that I wo n't have to wait long for the sixth installment The Winds of Winter ! I really do n't know how fans who started reading this series in 1996 have survived all of the time between publications ! Bottom Line Not as great as books 1 through 3 but I enjoyed this one a little bit more than A Feast for Crows . A must read for anyone who has already started the series ! 45 stars ",3
"I 've been a huge fan of GRRM 's writing ever since I discovered A Game of Thrones all those years ago . I went on to devour A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords as well as a bunch of his short stories and novellas . All of these works exciting and enthralling so much so that I was willing to forgive the A Feast for Crows fiasco thinking he 'd right the ship in the next book . With A Dance with Dragons well consider the ship still foundering.Unlike so many other reviewers I 'm not going to criticize Martin for taking the time to describe all the foods encountered throughout the world of his novel . I actually think that adds a layer of depth to the worldbuilding . I also think it 's childish to criticize Martin 's sex scenes as and I paraphrase the fantasy porn of a guy who does n't have much experience with women . Seriously sex food setting descriptionsall those things in fantasy novels are like ads in magazines to me . If I 'm interested I 'll slow down and pay attention . If not I 'll just skim through it until I get to the story.Some other reviewers have approached the heart of what 's wrong with this book and with AFFC before it . Characters travel and storylines are moved into position but the story does n't really move forward . Lots of set up things do happen but nothing meaningful that gets the main characters acting upon each other.But I think the problem goes deeper . It 's the characters in my book that are the problem . In the first three books the main characters were involved in every single page plotting to gain power and thwart each other . THAT was exciting . Some of them died but their deaths made sense . Since AFFC what I 've been most disheartened with is the endless stream of characters that do n't mean anything . For example I could have gone through all these books without having to read a chapter from the perspective of any of the Dornish characters . Davos ? His chapters were interesting but really ? Theon 's sister ca n't even remember her name Victarion a Brazen Beast here a Lannister uncle over there . It adds up to a whole mess of pages from characters I do n't give a crap about . On the other hand Arya gets a measly 2 chapters . Same with Bran . I ca n't even remember what happened to Rickon and who knows where Sansa is now . Catelyn ? Last I remember her she had had her head sewn back on but I ca n't remember seeing her since . And what happened to the other guy that kept dying and coming back Berric Dondarion I think ? The sprawl has his this series hard . And I 'm not sure GRRM can tighten it and bring it back under control.With ADWD the problem is that I do n't get to see enough of the main players acting in meaningful ways upon each others ' plotting . I feel like the story has n't moved since book 3 . Just when things were starting to pick up in this book GRRM pulls a frustrating little plot twist that 's starting to get old . And the book ends.It was n't all bad . I read it and continued to read it because I wanted to see where the story was going . Honestly though I was bored through the first 750 pages . I was more interested in the last 200 . But thenwell I wo n't give the spoiler here.And despite my misgivings I 'm still going to read the next one . I 'm holding on to this hope that these 2 last books were an aberration caused by the failed experiment of splitting two books by North and South . If he writes a condensed complete 6th book I think he can bring it back . Condensed in the sense that all the major players end up on the same stage without all those minor characters taking up precious space doing things that effect each other and moving the story forward . From all his other works I think he can pull it off . But he needs to do it quick not another 5 years of waiting.And that brings me to my final issue with the series . I 'm all for taking the time to write a polished product . But GRRM has taken that too far . I hardly remember a thing that happened in the 4th book and only remember the major events of the first 3 . Things get mentioned and referenced in this book that leave me drawing complete blanks . If Martin was releasing a book every 2 years that would n't be the case . With all the time that has passed the reader changes and the story starts to lose significance at least in my mind.So if you 've gotten this far it 's probably still worth reading . But do n't expect any fireworks . ",2
"No need for the 12 paragraph reviews I 've been reading . The review is simple After the third book this guy just ran out of gas but was making so much dough he kept going . Sort of . But not very well . ",1
"When I first read Martin 's books I was hooked . I love the series the world development and character realism for lack of a better term is amazing . However this book felt like an attempt at writing a dull history . Various threads are followed from previous books nothing really comes to conclusion and it just feels like a stopgap . Still very well written technically but there are terms that repeat well repeatedly.Overall I feel like it was written in bits and pieces without focus . I really hope the publishers and author pull it together and do not ruin what could be the best fantasy series in multiple decades . ",2
"I started watching the TV series before I was aware of the books..I read all 5 before season 2 came out . Waiting as patiently as possible for him to write the last books . Best fantasy political intrigue series I 've read to date . Tons of characters and points of view for an overall stupendous story . ",4
"GRRM is getting a little wordy with his prose and I feel like his publisher is having trouble telling him to pull it back . I really do n't need 2 full pages of description of a setting . It paints a nice picture but it slows the book to a halt.That being said I ate the whole thing up and loved every second of it . ",4
"I 've just been notified by Amazon that the paperback release date for this book has been pushed back AGAIN this time until September of 2014 . Absolutely ridiculous that it will take at least three and a half years to get a paperback to market and for people who like their series to be in the same format a hard cover is not an option .

"Its been a year since I finished Book 4 so it took a bit of memory jogging to remember where we last left off at and while I thought it was a good book it was just too long . GRRM could have lopped off half these chapters and been left with a great book instead of an ok one.I can not add much more to the conversation as others have before me but its really not as bad as the 12 star reviews suggest . Iswas 8 years to long before this book ? Yes it was . Has GRRM introduced so many characters I especially did not like the indifferent chapter titles as to make the reader angry with the constant POV changes ? Yes but still at the end of the day I found myself saying WOW and contemplating what I had just read.Please just dont keep us waiting . ",3
"After 5 books the verbiage is beginning to wear . I enjoyed the story well enough but if you 're going to title a book A Dance with Dragons there 'd better be dragons . they barely made a ripple in the storyline.Having said that I can hardly wait for the next installment . I 'm curious to know where this is all leading and if ANYone will be left standing at the end . ",3
"This book jumps and leaves you hanging very badly . Descriptions were very clear of the time period but as i SAID ON THE OTHER REVIEW OH WELL ENOUGH SAID ",4
"I enjoyed the story and would recommend it to others although this volume did n't seem to flow as well as other volumes . It might have been because of all the new characters that are introduced . The downside is that book # 6 is not available and not idea when it will be . The result is disappointing to the reader who craves what comes next . ",3
"I really enjoy this series . I rate this series as one of the best fantasy series ever up there with Tolkien on my list anyways . There is great depth to the story you can tell the author has spent a lot of time creating a realistic background setting for the current story . This is more hardcore fantasy it 's not niceprettysunshineetc . or anything very realistic and the author throws no punches . I would recommend this to any fantasy fan and any adult looking for a series with depth . You do n't have to be a fan of fantasy to enjoy this series but you should like more realistichardcore books if you are going to get into this series . ",4
"On the back cover of the book a journalist states that Martin is the closest thing America has to Tolkien . While Tolkien 's work will be cherished by readers for years to come this series has little chance of being a book of all time . It has nothing of the epic nature of the LOTRexcept its length . A better comparison of this work would be with the Wheel of Time series . Neither brings the story to any resolution at any point . This to this reader is the most frustrating element of this series in an often frustrating read.Martin stated he would finish the series at book 4 book 4 stretched on in to book 5 . Book 5 however is not a conclusion . The story just stops . It does n't take a prophet to see that more books will be coming from Martin in this series . I will make a personal prophetic utterance at this point Though I will read several hundreds of books before I leave this mortal coil another book in the Song of Ice and Fire series will not be one of them .

"this book series is amazing i enjoy books like these i love how this book series started i can not wait till books 6 and 7 get released GRRM and GRRM is one amazing author i give him alot of credit for making this amazing book series ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

"As with any series that is worthy of reading each book reveals more about its characters . You find yourself craving that information in an almost desperate way . Marten captures you with nonstop action and adventure . I only wish he can complete the story before I die . ",4
"It was okay I had to read it since I had read the other fourrather disappointed in the ending.No tie up and no prospect for another book that I know of . ",2
"I consciously tempered my expectations for this muchanticipated novel and I am glad I did . The writing had been on the wall with the relative letdown of A Feast for Crows like some red comet blazing through the sky of an overly convoluted plot with too many storylines and new POV characters . Unfortunately A Dance with Dragons follows the same ponderous tune.As willing as GRRM is to kill off some major POVcharacters he keeps adding new characters and brings back some of those presumed dead . Unfortunately many of these new characters could not capture me as the original ones could . So the return of Theon was a nice surprise . Of course Tyrion is truly brilliant and his chapters were by far the best and showed some satisfying character development . Otherwise I could n't connect with many others as previous favorites Jon Snow and Daenerys managed to annoy me.There is plenty of good as well . The worldbuilding is incredibly intricate and detailed and extremely well worked out . This series is Epic with a capital E. The same goes for the characters . Like them or not but they are consistent and lifelike with their good and bad traits and believable motivations . It 's too bad that the pacing of a Dance with Dragons is slow often marred by toodetailed description of food and lacking in action . A pity even though you can sense the setup for a phenomenal finish . If GRRM can untangle all these storylines and wrap them up in my lifetime.If I had to liken A Dance with Dragons to one of GRRM 's characters it would be Wyman Manderly Lord of White Harbor . Huge slow and ponderous with plenty of excess fat but also with some surprising twists of cunning and courage despite a lack of action.With all my misgivings GRRM is still one of the best epic fantasy writers out there and even a novel below his usual standard is still a novel worth reading . I would give three and half stars if I could but I will give four in the end just because I know part of my disappointment was due to expectations that could not be tempered . ",3
"As usual the story was well delivered and entertaining . Must admit that I 'm ready for it to come to a conclusion soon . ",3
"I feel this is the weakest book in the Song of Fire and Ice series so far . Half the time I felt I was slogging through the book . While I found the chapters on Daenerys to be rather interesting the others were less than satisfying . For anyone who may not already know the majority of this book happens in parallel to the previous novel A Feast for Crows . Toward the end some of the characters covered in Crows have their stories continued here . As a result it felt to me like he touched on a lot of different characters throughout without advancing the story sufficiently.A few characters received the bulk of coverage in this book Jon Daenerys Tyrion and Theon at least early on . Somehow despite the numerous chapters about Jon I did n't feel much progress was made in his storyline . His interactions with Melisandre felt repetitive . There was very little action and it felt like it took too long for anything with the wildings to progress it would take a whole chapter to discuss a plan and then a whole chapter to more or less repeat the same thing by having it done . The chapters dealing with Daenerys were my favorites with much of the action and discussion centering how to achieve peace and what to do about the dragons . Even those chapters took a long time for any real progress in the events . And for all the chapters dedicated to Stannis 's assault on Winterfell he does n't get very far.At times it feels like Martin has overstretched himself by having too many characters ' viewpoints and simultaneous storylines to cover . Having just two chapters for a character such as Arya Davos and Jaime feels more like a teaser than anything else . Other characters such as Samwell and Sansa are left out completely . Having the wealth of different viewpoints can make the work quite interesting at times but some storylines end up shortchanged . At this point it feels like he 'll need not just the planned two more books but several more to come to a real conclusion and tie up all the loose ends . ",2
"George RR Martin continues his excellent series with this 5th book and thankfully it is an improvement on A Feast For Crows although it still falls short of the first three books in the series . Martin 's excellent narrative style still makes it an enjoyable read and we get some progress on characters missing from the last book . Unfortunately there is still very little plot progress with far too many plotlines in a holding pattern . At least we seem poised for progress in the next book . Considering the very long delay for this book there may be very high expectations but readers will enjoy it more if they scale back their expectations on plot progress . ",2
"Not much to say that hasnt been said that is if you like the overall story of course this is a must the physical book itself is big and sturdy for a bookshelf and collectionnot something to be traveled with . I personally cant wait for the next book ",4
"Another outstanding book in the series and I 'm starving for the next one . Please Mr. Martin do n't make us wait too much longer . ",4
"This series keeps getting bettter and better . I ca not wait for the next book to come uout . Keep them coming George . ",4
"I like this book but it has very few twists and turns for such a large number of pages . It should be more action packed or with a few pages . ",3
"I was very disappointed in this book.The plot does n't develop significantly but that is not my main criticism.I can see what Martin is doing with the story and I appreciate it.It is a buildup every story needs that.What lost me was the worldbuilding.Way too many characters and cultures.Endless lists of names and relations.What am I reading a family tree ? Or a travel guide ? I can see why the author might think this makes the world bigger and more realistic etc but it fails . Why am I wasting my time reading about hundreds of irrelevant notevensecondary characters ? Answer I 'm not . I had to do the unthinkable and skim through this verbiage . If you are a speedreader this is the perfect book to practice on . I suspect Martin likes to make his readers suffer but I think he even failed at that here . Instead of suffering I skipped.Pros I enjoyed the descriptions of feasts Jordan is a pro at that and it makes my mouth water to read . The early Tyrion chapters were a nice diversion . I enjoyed the Theon plot arc although it was horrifying . The opening of his first chapter hit me unexpectedly and my stomach still roils thinking about it . Props to that Martin you got me . I was not expecting that . I also had some fun digging back into the 2nd and 3rd book to find out who Reek was.However in the end the book just was n't believable . The motivations and decisions of many characters felt forced . For instance why would the Boltons want Reek to listen in on their secretpersonal talks ? Why for the author to give the reader some juicy info . Add in silly cliffhangers concluding each chapter new POVs more scenery more setup more verbiage and cutaways from action and the book had me scratch my head thinking huh ? instead of that 's amazing ! like the previous books.It 's staggering how this series went from a focused dramatic saga to a recital of minutiae . Martin must have gotten convinced along the way that the worldbuilding was the best part of his books because he 's delved into that headfirst trying to grow the world so large that it absorbs every possible name event history etc . But it just becomes encyclopedic in nature instead of dramatic and all the superfluous stuffing smothers the story.I laughed at my friends who had been suckered into Jordan 's pointless world.Joke is on me this time . A Feast for Crows was superior to this book at least the author 's voice was confident . A Dance with Dragons reads like a stunted and rickety mess.I am unsure whether to continue with this series . Just because one of the books is bad does n't mean all hope is lost . But I am a little worried that with all the extra plot threads I 'll have no idea who is who and what is what next go round and that the author will undoubtedly throw in hundreds more unnecessary characters . There is just too much here and little of it is interesting and I only have so many brain cells to devote to fictional worlds . ",0
"First off I have the kindle version and it works just fine I had no problems with it at all . Now for the review of the bookThe first few books started out with a Bang and I thought we were going to get something special and new . Instead this book has continued what started in the 3rd book with a descent in obsessiveness with mediocre ramblings that while connected to the main story do NOT in any way move the story forward.It 's turning into the Wheel of time series for being excessively wordy and boring . I honestly think that the writer is just writing to make money and not tell a story.The writer just fails to engage beyond the interest created in the first 2 books . Great you 're trying to give us plot twists and intrigue possible redemption for a few and definite characters that are grey neither good or bad just normal.That does n't mean that the author has to spend pages and pages without moving the story forward . At this point I 'm not sure I 'm going to read the rest of the books . I do n't like getting bilked and that 's what this is starting to feel like . ",0
"For the end of the saga there were to many unresolved questions . I want another book to close the story . ",2
"I had been waiting for this book to come out in paperback for almost two years now . And I was not disappointed . ",4
"I Could n't Stop Reading The Series Until I Finished Book Five I Like Them Better Than Any Movie.The Only Thing Bad Is Now I Got To Wait Till Book Six Is Published . ",4
"I really love reading these books but they always end when they get good . Wish he would tie up some loose ends sometimes . You can tell he use to write for Tv as he always ends with you wanting more . Ca n't wait for the next one to come out ",4
"Martin 's epic continues . The characters neglected in Book Four receive their due in Book Five . Favorites live or die or appear to die . Dragons become more than house pets . If one has read the first four books one must read this one too and look forward to the next installment . ",3
"Those who rate this highly are beguiled by poor workmanship that telling a story involves . As noted before the series of a Song of Ice and Fire started well but as Martin has evolved the story one he now clearly had little idea about when he started it has bloated to a workmanship that only wants to portray that all men are evil.And women too yet their burden is that they know that they will end up as whores . All in this series know that their lives are worthless and here in the book devoted to slavery it is the base nature of the tale that overcomes all else.A book that could easily be half the size it is should we have lost the naming and characterization of countless characters who you forget the minute a page is turned . Now clearly introduced and written in so that the producers of the television show have a guideline for casting when the extras without speaking parts are to be shown on screen . Nothing can come in between Martin and his new mercenary exploitation of his series.Take that half that we did not need and get to the story that matters and again half more could be thrown out . It took over a third of the book before interest seeps in to you to see that there is a theme and a reason to hold on as we shift between far too many views . And see Tyrion once again go from countless frying pans and fires until you wonder how he can even have a cheerful attitude at the end whilst that of Jorah Mormont 's demeanor who has seen far less misadventure should be the mien our favorite Imp wears.Then as we see Jon Snow emerge as perhaps the truest heir of his father Martin once agains twists fate around on its ass as if he laughs at all his readers showing he does n't care about building any attachments but to those of evil . That is more and more the theme and shows a blatant disregard that any who have ruled the people of the seven kingdoms should note that all will eventually be in rebellion as no lord protects their people . All can be sacrificed enslaved treated like crap if you can lay claim to a titled name in a land where you have more kneelers than your foes and all friends are actually foes as well.Twist of fate and twist again as the end approaches . Delay of timelines so those twists may take place . Evil grows ever more and who really cares about Winter . Who even needs it if all below the Wall and elsewhere are intent on destroying what others have thus in they end their own gets destroyed as well.Thus a three star rating . Where Jordan gave us characters who were like us with flaws we could see and a goal that might have been hopeless yet heroes who strive towards it . Here Martin gives us man who are not us for al these are base . Every person of power base . Every person who has a veneer of serving Justice is hiding much more evil than all the rest combined . And let us not forget that most days it is clear that Martin schemes ways to make more money out of HBO and the series play with his toys rather than focus on writing else the time between books would finish much more quickly.There is no valid reason to tender this with high marks . Far too many POV Characters have littered the tale far too much bloat of unnecessary additions are in it . A book a quarter the size would have got the job done . ",2
"Liked this book so much more than the 4th in the series which mostly seemed like people wandering around the countryside . Perhaps because my favorite characters were featured more ? One could almost skip the 4th and move right on to this without missing much . Great story and ca n't wait for the next book to come out . ",3
"Martin insists that he 's got everything under control that plot is n't the beall and endall that he is equally concerned with character development and worldbuilding that his epic is resting as with Tolkien in The Two Towers.Really ? In The Two Towers Tolkien the genuine article not the American counterfeit manages to develop plot character and build his world including several races and languages simultaneously and while he 's resting he chronicles a major battle at Helm 's Deep the destruction of Isengard and the overthrow of Saruman and Frodo 's fight with Shelob and subsequent capture by the Orcs . And all in 400 pages.This is resting ? Martin is not the American Tolkien nor any other kind of Tolkien . He is if anything the prose equivalent of Yanni perpetual middle and no end . Those who love this kind of work stylistically similar to The Osbournes The Kardashians New Jersey Housewives even The Sopranos particularly if Tony had been killed during the first season will likely love this and will continue to do so as the characters plots venues and volumes multiply.Martin had a promising first act but the literary world is replete with promises that quickly fizzle . Perhaps the publishers could give the series a title more fitting to lowered expectations Westeros Housewives . ",0
"Book 5 continues to demonstrate George R. R. Martin 's ability to create develop and sustain fascinating characters in a consistent world . While I was not thrilled with the way books 4 and 5 dealt with chronology I understand and respect the reasons he expressed for breaking the story up that way . Still working my way through this one I 'm an avid but not a fast reader waiting to find out the fate of some of the characters I like best afraid of the moment when I will find myself finished with Book 5 before Book 6 is published ",4
"Awesome now I can finish the entire series in a couple of sittings . Do n't know how it ends but want to knowand now I will finally get the oppurtunity to so . ",4
"A Dance With Dragons is fifth book in the Song of Ice and Fire series and I am hooked lock stock and barrel . In this installment the first 60 % of the book covers the same time period as that covered in a Feast for Crows but focuses on things taking place outside of Westeros at the Wall and beyond and in the Free Cities . The last 40 % sees the two parallel tracks merge together and move forward . The immensity of the vision required for this series is beyond belief . New characters continue to be introduced including a few that likely will be central to the plot moving forward . Although this book lacks the relentless plot punches of the third installment Storm of Swords there are enough jawdropping moments to satisfy even the most blood thirsty including two unforgettable scenes involving the dragons.Among the things I love about this series are 1 complicated threedimensional characters that can be loved or hated with passion 2 intricate political intrigue with endless twists and turns 3 an amazingly vivid original fantasy world with more nuances than you can count 4 heroes villains underdogs vipers champions animals feats of valor.the list goes on and on . The unforgettable characters in this series include Jon Snow bastard son of Lord Eddard Stark and the current Lord High Commander of the Night 's Watch desperate to wear the mantle of power with honor and grace Arya Stark Jon 's halfsister hidden in Braavos while she learns who she is and where her destiny will lead her Danaerys Targaryen Blood of the Dragon gathering power and the strength to take back the Iron Throne ripped from her family in blood Tyrion Lannister the Imp exiled from the Seven Kingdoms after being branded a king and kinslayer hunted by his evil sister Cersei mother to King Tommen for whom no amount of power would ever be enough and of course the animals including Ghost direwolf and familiar of Jon Snow and the three dragon children of Danaerys Dhrogon Viserion and Rhaegal . All of these and many more are woven into the intricate tapestry that is this series . I could read these books forever . Opening the cover and starting to read is like diving into a deep pool and feasting your eyes on an aquarium of the most amazing creatures you can imagine . I ca n't even fathom how George R.R . Martin keeps the worlds people histories and back stories of each and every complex character straight . If he keeps going for 10 more books I am in . ",4
"After reading 5000+ pages of these characters I was highly disappointed in the ending of this book until I found out there were other books in the works . I purposely waited to read this series until I thought the last book was published but I was surprised . Now I am waiting along with untold amounts of people for the continuing saga . I was missing the stories of Bran Rickon and Jaime and Brianne . I am a little tired of evil always winning out and would like to see a few of these characters put in their place Hello Cersei for a little bit longer . ",3
"I enjoyed the first three books . There were some really interesting characters and twists and turns . I do n't know if dementure set in or what but Martin lost the plot in books 4 and 5 literally . It kind of reminded me of Anne Rice novels from the 80s . Way too much detail and side plots that were frankly boring and irrelavant . Meanwhile the really interesting plots moved at a snails pace.I am able to read boring documents believe me but this was just too much . I barely read half of it and I wo n't be buying the last book I do n't think . Such a waste as there were some exciting stories building . He just made it too complicated and not in a good way . In an extrecutiating way . There should have only been 4 books in the series total with all the crap removed . ",1
"Book 5 of the ASoIAF is great . Neglected characters from Book 4 are back and facing new challenges . Martin has not failed to keep the story exciting and the ending paves the way as usual for the next book in the epic tale . ",4
"I ca n't put it down . Of course you have to start with one and watching the show gives me a mental picture of the characters . ",4
"Wow ! ! I could n't put it down . You never know what 's happening next or who will die or live . Ca n't wait for the next book . This is an epic saga . ",4
"I just received this today . I wanted to cry . I love my books . This books was poorly packed therefore I have a beat up book and book cover . The cover is bent up in quite a few places . The Book my main concern has a dent and a rip in the top front left hand side . The dent is about and inch and a half long . There is also a dent the same length in the upper right hand corner . The bottom front left hand corner is bent in the bottom front right hand corner is bent in . On the back the book is bent in on the lower left hand corner and and the lower right hand corner . I take good care of my books and I would expect a book that I buy brand new would look as such . I will from now on order a book by it 's self and see if it gets packed better . Although I should not have to do so . I do hope Amazon does something about this problem . My book was not protected at all . This was not right . I will update and let you know how I like the reading of the book soon . Do Not recommend buying this book with other products.May 9 2013 I am writing an update on my book review . The book was a great read . I loved it . It was hard to put down . I am anxious now for the next one . There are lots of characters but he the author makes it easy to keep up with them . He does so by Putting a title on each chapter that has to do with that person . So if you forget something it is easy to go back and remind yourself . I love all of these books ",4
"I have read all five of the Game of Thrones series . I actually read read them in a row after i had watched the first season on TV .

",4
"The first three books in this series were excellent . I could hardly put them down . The fourth book bored me almost to tears . This book was n't quite so boring but was still not up to the standards of the first three . I read it because I 'm committed to the series . Lets hope the next book is better . ",3
"One huge let down ! Evil always wins the day ? ? What kind of ending is that ? I had hoped for some piece of hope for the ending..The last ten pages left nothing and answered nothing . All thisled to this ending ? ? I hope Mr. Martin is enjoying his money because I would never read him again . ",2
"I do n't like the way it left off ! It leaves you wanting a book 6 to tie up all the loose ends ! What becomes of Daenerys and her dragons ? What happens to Sansa Arya Bran and Rickon ? Does Tyrion make it back to Kings Landing ? Does Cercei survive ? I mean really there is so much left..right ? ! ",3
"A lot of plot progressing . Mostly great . Partly amazing . Not as great as the previous ones in the series . Definitely worth the wait ! ",4
"I read previous reviews and thought maybe i would n't continue reading the series.I am so glad i did n't give upLOVED ITYes there were more people added but that just made it more excitingHope this does n't enddenise ",4
"Well after waiting 5 years for this book I can safely say it was worth every minute . Working my way through at a snails pace tobe sure I absorb it all has been the hardest part . So much happens in this book I considered making note cards so I wouldn'tforget anything.I hope everyone is giving this book a chance . I am a George R.R . Martin fan since his first book was released years ago . I recently reread them all again so as to be up to date when this book came out.Give it a shot and I guarantee you wo n't be disappointed.Already waiting for the next one ",4
"I love this series . Originally I watched the HBO shows and just wanted to know more about the characters and events.But now having reading Books 15 I have a totally different perspective regarding many characters and themes in this story.I 'm watching the current HBO Game of Thrones almost season end and it is deviating quite a bit from the books . It will be interesting how they handle the story line.To be honest reading the books and watching the shows have actually become two different stories with similarities.I suggest both books and shows . Great entertainment . ",4
"while this book keeps you up to date with the characters we all love or hate . But al it really does is set up the next book . We do n't know when the dragons return although it was Great to see Cursi great some pay back . But we have to wait until next winter if we 're lucky to learn anything more . At this point I 'm hoping I live long enough to finish this wonderful story . But to hear that the actor playing king Jophery is quitting acting because he ca n't deal with the hate his character drew . He is a first rate actor and should be proud that he did such a great job . He could be a major star if he kept at it . It saddens me that he took things personally he is truly gifted and I 'm sorry it has driven him to quit acting.Since season four will only be part of book four it really is a drag that after ten shows you have to wait a year to see what happens next . So great writing and I understand filming takes a long time but remember when there were nine months to a season with the summer off . Even six months would be great . But it take a lot of effort to write and to produce for TV . I hope I live to see the end . ",4
"Its clear now after Feast and Dancing either Martin the publisher or both want to milk this for all its worth and there is no plan to conclude the saga . Yet again as in FFC this one has no plots resolved and too many new characters . I remember when this was supposed to be a three book series . I wish it had stayed that way . I will buy the next book but I will buy a used version because the series is no longer worth $ 10 . ",1
"George R.R.Martin has a way of keeping you engaged in the book . It is had to put down . It is very well written and thought out with many twist and turns . ",4
"Is it good ? I got asked this by my brother who has only seen the show and saw me reading the newest book . Since obviously I could n't discuss much with him but he still wanted to know as everyone else has been wanting to knowIs it good ? Yes it 's good . It 's better than a Feast for Crows by virtue of it 's characters alone . But wow it 's also incredibly frustrating . Sorry for the quick change of mood there but that 's exactly what it 's like to read this book . Moments will make you snap to attention and instantly remember why you 've waited so long for the series and how you loved it in the first place . This book has the power to draw you away from your world and into its . But these are but brief illuminations in a dark and often blindly led journey.Dance 's biggest problem is it 's pacing which is to say stop and go . Whenever you think something major is about to happen the book seems intent at preventing it . And yet this is a gargantuan of a novel . What makes up the extra space in between actual happenings ? Exposition and traveling . So much of what is spoken could have only been mentioned and still had the same effect . Take for instance every Victarion Greyjoy chapter . Are the iron born interesting ? Yes they are and very much so . Is there any amount of information in his chapters that could n't have been neatly condensed into one ? No.This becomes a problem later on when things should be picking up but never seem to . There is hardly a character in this book that does n't seemingly have their story end one chapter or more too short . And not in the I must know what happens next way but rather in the I fear this may be another six year cliffhanger manner . Then there is the almost laughable cases of Bran and Davos . I swear to the seven that I flipped back through the book just to make sure that I did n't somehow miss more of their chapters . Let me save you the time . You didn'tThe other major problem is actually some of the characters themselves . Yes they are much better than the ones we got in Feast for Crows but only barely . The biggest offender is no other than Tyrion himself . His story is long mildly eventful sometimes utterly bizarre in ways good and bad but worst of all and I ca n't believe I 'm writing this it 's humorless . A chuckle here and there maybe but for the most part Martin loses his way with Tyrion 's dialogue . Danerys sadly fairs much the same . She and Tyrion for that matter has some INCREDIBLE moments in this book but for the most part she spends her time spinning her wheels and kicking up mud all around here the whole time . Yet again it 's all in an effort to end the story in an interesting place and then take what may happen away for another day . Which leads us to Jon Snow . The strongest of the three major characters Jon 's story sees him discovering leadership as well as himself as a person . It 's a good story with some great little moments and even in its ' drawn out passages it still seems the most driven . Yet it ends with not only a cliffhanger for his own situation but the ones of others as well who do n't get their own final chapters.There 's also a problem with new additions . I 'll be brief . Tyrion meets an uninteresting dwarf woman who gets much dialogue and time Danerys is practically surrounded by a cast of who ? s that you get to know and become who cares ? many sell sword companies are introduced out of the blue and now have quite a bit of sway . None of those compare to the holy mother of huh ? characters however . For the sake of extreme spoilers I will not mention the name but the character comes right out of the blue and can completely change everything that has been done so far . I hope there is a satisfying reasoning to thissurprise and it was n't just done to give us a minime version of a well dead character we could never have but I fear the later.Yet I give this book 3 stars and I say it is good . That 's because it is . For instance take the surprising quality of the Reek chapters . By now I 'm going to assume it 's no major spoiler to say that Reek is Theon Greyjoy . It might be a spoiler however to let you know that his chapters might be the best in the book . They are purposeful deliberate and constantly interesting . They also introduce us to some fantastic new villains in the Boltons and just for hell he becomes a rallying point of sorts for other major characters . In Theon 's story you will find that old magic once again that the first three books had in spades.He 's not the only one . Davos and Bran may be cut short but what 's there is great . The activities of King Stannis and those around him are always interesting and make for some of the best intrigue in the book . Asha Greyjoy has a short but sweet story that puts her in an active position within the overall story . Ser Barristan Selmy has a few very very good chapters . And while I still find Tyrion 's chapters to be boring Jon and Danerys overall provide the major plots of this tale and both contribute enough to make it worth while . The best characters though ? The precious few chapters we get from the Feast for Crows gang . Not only do they advance the unresolved plots of Jamie Cersei and No One but they are also some of the best written of the bunch further suggesting that Martin knows where he going with the plot but that he needed these last two books to turn a real big ship around to get there.Then there are those moments . In fact I retract my earlier statement . It 's not the characters that make this better than a Feast for Crows it 's those damn moments . This installment spreads them around more liberally than its ' predecessor did and is the much better for it . This book feels more alive than A Feast for Crows even when it 's just shuffling it 's feet . Plus like I said it may take a while to get there but by the end of this book the whole overall plot feels much more on track and focused . Oh and that last chapter ? Gravy . Pure indulgence and a fantastic bookend to both fully hype you for book six and remind you the power Martin still wields with a pen over your very soul and even your expectations.Ultimately I may have fallen under the same curse as Martin and spoke too many words . Because you will read this book and you very much should . Ultimately some will say that the wait was too long for too much unresolved . Maybe that 's true . But as a whole and judged on it 's own this is a more than solid entry into the Ice and Fire series and while not destined to become everyone 's favorite is still a hard work of fiction to out right hate.But George can I sum up quickly what fans want for Winds of Winter ? More Dragons Less Dancing . ",2
"Amazing book and tv series . This book is a little bit review but also gets into what else will happen after where the series ended last season . I look forward to the next books and to see how this all turns out . Who will end up ruling from the iron throne ? I am rooting for the Mother of Dragons . I bought the hardback and it is BIG . ",4
"As usual Martin delivers with this 5th installment ! I just wish all of them were written already ! I ca n't wait for book 6 ! ",4
"I probably was expecting way too much having had the past six years to build up those expectations.I have no doubt that given the depth of plans within schemes alongside plots I 'll end up picking up more of the story in rereads as has been the case whenever I reread the previous books.The first half deals with characters and events that were happening during the timeline of Feast For Crows and while it still makes for good reading the second half is undoubtedly much more interesting . No it did n't have much of the major events I was hoping for but Martin has never failed to surprise and shock me and while there were n't as many powerful and shocking moments as I would 've liked they were still there and well worth it.I was surprised that Cersei and Jaime were given what chapters they were considering that they were so prominent in Feast For Crows and I wish Martin would 've labeled all of the chapters with that viewpoint 's character name rather than a reference to what role that character might have been fulfilling at the time . I found myself skimming a few paragraphs ahead when that happened to make sure I knew which character that chapter dealt with.I admittedly was disappointed that many of my questionsanticipations still went unanswered but I have more than enough faith that Martin will get to those in time although I would n't be surprised if it takes him three more epic books rather than the two more he currently sees for the series.Still it is merely because I 've come to expect such entertaining genius from Martin that anything short of that disappoints.The fact is that I kept looking forward to getting back to it and finishing it just as I look forward to rereading it very soon . ",4
"Book five is better than book four and really four was n't bad . I loved this book ! Now I will go into mourning while I wait for book six be completed . ",4
"I would have rather seen more on the existing characters fans of the series know and love . It seems like Martin felt like he HAD to make new characters to make Dance a big book . It is good but a little disappointing given how long we had to wait for it . ",2
"Just a continuation of great writing . Plots and twist that make perfect since but you still do n't see coming.Cant wait for next installment.David ",4
"Title says it all now if we just dont have to wait 10 years for the next one . Really there is a word minimum ? ? ",3
"I understand most of the reviewers point about how in terms of the storyline this book did not move it along . However we all knew this years back and this should have not been a surprise to fans of aSoIF . We all knew ' A Feast for Crows ' and ' A Dance with Dragons ' were actually suppose to be one volume but was split up due to size but let 's be honest it 's probably due to $ also . So to go into this book and expect something different is totally insane . It 's like opening a can of CocaCola and expecting it to taste like Dr Pepper ! To penalize this book 's qualityrating because of this is unfair . If ' A Feast for Crows ' and ' A Dance with Dragons ' came out in back to back years this would not even be an issue.I agree with most fans that GRRM is taking way too long to finish this series the first book came out in 1996 so it 's 16 years and counting as of this review ! Perhaps if he did n't get sidetracked with so many side projects he would have finished years earlier . The gaps are so long in between each book that I have to lookup Wikipedia what happened in the last book . GRRM is doing himself and his series a disservice with his slightly faster than snails pace writing because people have lives and as time goes on so do our interest and attention span.Now onto this book 's review it once again showed why GRRM is truly a great story teller and how much time and effort he puts into the complexity of characters and storyline . I wo n't spoil it for those who have n't read it yet but there 's a character who we hate because he betrayed the Starks in book 2 and yet in this book we root for him to escape his captors . This character supposedly really 'Reeks ' . A good writer will make the reader feel engaged and emotionally invested in the story and characters and GRRM does that better if not the best than many current authors . This book does move the story along for other characters such as Tyrion my favorite and what happened to him since he murdered his father . It just doesnt move the story along in terms of the entire series but hey that 's not you were expecting right ? ",3
"Book Five and Book Four were very disappointing . Book Five sort of retraces stories told in Book Four from other perspectives even though the outcomes are already known . I hope Mr. Martin intends to correct the errors of prose in these two books when he pens the six . Love the series not a fan of the last 2 books . ",2
"This is the best book of the series . Read it . Now . You will not be disappointed in your choice . Trust me . ",4
"I 'm not sure anyone will read my review since it 's coming in after something like 850 entries but just in case I wanted to put my two cents in because all the almost hysterical antiDWD rants may actually discourage people from buying the book and I think that would be a mistake.Here 's my take on way people are so enraged some general nonspecific spoilers1 . They genuinely care about the book and want it to be the brilliant onceinfiftyyears fantasy it has promised to be . They are afraid it wo n't particularly since GRRM has taken 10 years to produce Books 4 & 5 which could really be one book . GRRM like all of us is mortal so people are worried God forbid he will not have enough time to finish the books at all andor he lacks the discipline and well power to do so.By the way anyone who tosses out bizarre insults about GRRMhe 's lazy he 's arrogant etc I dismiss out of hand . If you have such little respect for him do n't read his stuff.2 . BOoks 4 & 5 are 'middle ' books much as the second book in the LOTR trilogy was . GRRM deliberately decides to have his characters go in circles and for nothing to 'happen ' that is part of his point here . Such books are much easier to read when there is a Book 6 & 7 to read immediately or when you are confident Books 6 & 7 will be on their way shortly . People are not confident of this.3 . The world of the pseudo Near East was poorly imagined not as realistic as the Western Westeros . In particular Dany 's world was not fully fleshed outit is entirely corrupt & despotic with no positive traits . Yet the slave world of say Egypt also had greatnessreligion the arts etc . This Western stereotype of an Egypt=like state made Dany 's stay there very hard to bear because in addition to the onedimensional world Dany herself was behaving really really onedimensionally.Spoiler QUESTIONDid anyone else pick up the possibility that Dany was being bespelled by the wizards and that was the reason she locked her dragons and lost her way ? There are numerous hints in the book.4 . Finally the books could have used editing . Indeed with good editing Books 4 & 5 could have been one book of about 800 pages max . Nearly all of the Brienne chapters of Book 4 for instance could have been omitted . In this book several Dany chapters could have been omitted with zero negative repercussions.PositivesSo what 's good about this book ? The tone scope and breadth of this book was outstanding . If you view this as a tale in which Westeros and the outside world are CHARACTERS themselves the story becomes much more interesting.GRRM I believe is attempting to make this a story about a whole world rather than a mere story about Westeros . Because he decided to do this he had to follow several story strands he did n't anticipate he would follow . This is also primarily a story about powerhow to get it how to lose it what you do when you have it and what exactly it is . In this case the story centers mostly on the 'how to use it ' with Jon and Dany really struggling.As with all great writers GRRM takes story arcs and goes FAR past the predictableTyrion kills his father . But the story does n't end at all . Dany frees the slaves . Then what ? Jon gets power . Then what ? Arya trains . But now what ? Bran finds the Children of the Forest . Now what ? What I find particularly great about the book is how GRRM refuses to categorize good or evil with the exception of a truly evil person like the Bolton thing . Even with the Others it is not clear entirely what their purpose is or what they are . Is the 'kind man ' Arya trains with evil or good ? Does it matter ? Which of the religions are 'true ' ? All ? None ? Are they really one ? These questions are examined in even more detail and depth in this book than in others.It is a 'dance ' and the dance goes nowhere . That is part of the point.I may be wrong but I think GRRM had the most difficulty writing these books 4 & 5 because he did n't originally anticipate having to write themthey are mostly a bridge between 'here ' and 'there ' both of which he seems to have mapped out . It 's the bridge part he 's had trouble with figuring out just how to get the characters from here to there and what the point of the journey was . I do think the next two books will come quicker and will have a lot more action now that all the chess pieces are in place.I would definitely recommend reading this particularly if like me you know ahead of time that it 's not extremely action packed although it definitely has its moments . Worth your time . ",4
"Well written as usual the story is breathtaking . However a bit disappointed that some characters seem to turn around . Arya 's part was a bit dull . Yet I 'm looking forward to reading the next one . ",3
"The book is wellwritten and if you like the rest of the series you will like this . It still only deserves 1 or 2 stars in my opinion for 2 reasons1 Too many characters that died or seemed to in the previous books come magically back to life . This Deus ex Machina will not help the plot . In real life we deal with dead people and the problems the deaths left behind . The first books did that . This book tells us that they were n't really dead it was a deception . Blech.2Martin pulls a Robert Jordan and creates new points of view that extend the plot rather than wrapping up plot threads . We want an ending to the series even if it makes us sad to see it wrapped up.I also found it confusing to read because even though I know it takes place concurrent with the previous novel it was hard to mentally go back to before this happened . I will have to get both converted to text then rearrange all the chapters of both books chronologically to get a better picture.My request as a reader Let the dead stay dead . Minimize the points of view . Write the end of the series now and then write everything that happens between Dance and the end . But make sure the end is written if you die at least we 'll have a satisfying ending to a wonderful literary banquet . ",1
"This continues the story from the series and does NOT disappoint . More of the wonderful writing style of George R.R.Martin . Good read ! ",4
"I really loved the series and was looking forward to the resolution of a lot things . No resolution . Also an epilogue that made me think the writer is saying I 'm done with this one . ",1
"If you expect action and hope that the story will move along a bit you will be disappointed . Not much happens . But the description and intrigue is rich and well worth the read . I would have felt better about reading this book if I knew that the author was hard at work on the next volume . Unfortunately George is still on the book tour circuit as of January 2012 with no obvious intent to ever finish this series . Whether he will need a ghost writer to finish it for him remains to be seen . I hope he has plotted it out to grease the chute for his replacement . ",2
"The book is already amazing so I feel like I would repeat the many great revies about it I want to comment on the wrapping one more time and on the edition . Five stars out of five this is what I give to this order very satisfied and happy it arrived in excellent condition and on time . ",4
"Just finished the thronemaster 's 5th installment of power . Oh yes winter is coming ! Dance with Dragons was filled with my favorite characters . George never fails on coming up with original story lines . Words are wind ! I ca n't wait until the HBO series comes out . Very curious on how they will fuse the 4th and 5th book together for film . Fans you wo n't find out in this book who wins the game of thrones . As usual he leaves us all hanging . Here are some of the storylines that I enjoyed.DanerysQueen of the freed slaves is also Queen of Mereen . She is in love with her captain Daharis but marries Hizdahr to enable a peace treaty . Her dragons have grown into monsters . One of them is loose and burning people to death . The other two are caged in a pit inside of the pyramidcastle of the city . The chains are n't holding up from their fire.The day after her wedding Danerys attends a show that involves death fights . Her dragon swoops in and ruins the event . The show involves all kinds of perspectives including Tyrion 's but when seen through her eyes it suggests that she is tired of her childrendragons running amok . She tries to discipline the monster with a whip which kind of works . She mounts him like a horse and he flies away . Everyone thinks she is dead but she lives on an island with her dragon . At the end of the book a tribe of Dothraki find her chowing down on a horse with her dragon.After Danerys marries Hizdahr another man comes into her life the prince of Dorne . He wants to marry her and he too has ancestors from the Targaryen family . She rejects him but he does n't leave the city . He refuses to believe that she is dead and then sets her dragons free believing he can control them . He ends up dead but now there are three dragons on the loose.After Danerys leaves Mereen her faithful servant Ser Barristan the guy Joffrey kicked out of the kingsguard back in season 1 or 2 investigates . He suspects her husband was trying to kill her with honeyedlocusts . The dragon ruined his plan.TyrionHe snuck his way out of King 's Landing after killing his father Tywin Lannister . He was helped by the bad eunuch Visrys . He embarks upon a trip to Dorne with another captive Danerys 's little brother who everyone thought had been murdered . Tyrion 's original travel companions die or get lost after a storm and he winds up in chains under Sir Jorah Mormont 's supervision . He and another dwarf are now part of a circus headed for Mereen to entertain the lords . He and the other dwarf entertain Queen Danerys and the city at the fight . Sir Jorah is also part of the act . Their lord a rich man from Mereen tries to kill them with a maneating lion but again the dragon scene ruins the plan.ReekTheonThis is my favorite story line . Theon was never one of my favorite characters but in this book he shines ! The Bastard of Bolton AKA Lord Ramsay takes Theon for a pet and tortures him nonstop . The man psychologically looses his identity and takes on a new persona the persona given to him by his master . He is now Reek the timid meek batteredwife syndrome PSTD prisoner who has forgotten most of his past . He is made to live in a hole and eat rats . He is not allowed to bathe and often flayed for the entertainment of Lord Ramsay . One day he is actually needed to play himself Theon Greyjoy . Lord Ramsay wants Winterfell so he marrys Arya Stark who of course is someone else . He needs ReekTheon to vauge for him and vouch for the girl 's identity . A big wedding is held at Winterfell and Theon through plots and schemes of others gets free . This story reminds me of a DraculaRenfield relationship.CirceShe had a much bigger story line in the 4th book but nonetheless George does n't leave us hanging on her imprisonment of the septas . For punishment she is made to walk across King 's Landing naked . Her head and beaver are shaved . Townspeople throw things at her and make fun . She does live but will never have any respect as queen . Her Uncle Kevan the hand and king regent is murdered by Visyrs the bald eunuch . Before Kevan Lannister dies Visyrs tells him he is doing it for the Realm and Circe will of course blame the Tyrells . Love the Machiavellian tactics ! My Review There are so many new characters and new places . The maps inside of the book were not helpful . I could n't find Meereen or Slaver 's Bay . The story has several moments of greatness but too many pages in between . This book has been the most difficult of the series for me to read . The plot keeps getting bigger and bigger reading much like a history book at times . The characters ' family trees have centuries of back stories that could have easily been condensed . Personally this story could be even more brilliant if 300400 pages were edited out of it . In the end I love it . For all of Martin 's faults it 's the unique and revolutionary story that keeps me coming back for more . His jaded themes of religion and politics resonate with me . And love well it 's just a means to an end in this series . The only halfway decent moral character was Ned Stark . Look what happened to him ! Nice guys finish last ! I will buy and read the next book and the book after that and the book after thatI 'm hooked . 45 stars ",3
"Wonderful story writing . So much going on and ca n't wait to find out who will win . Exciting tale ! These books are long and fully detailed . Feels like you are a part of the story . It 's a big game and you pick your winners . ",4
"I am a huge fan of the series . If you made it through the first four books by now you know that Mr. Martin has 7 books planned so this is not the end of the series . He did a good job of fleshing out the story and left us lots of cliffhangers to make us long for the next book . I still hate the bad guys and hope that some of the good guys last until the last book . I would think that Martin has tons of motivation to get the series completed with his HBO exposure to current and future fans.Read it . It is a great escape from the real world . ",3
"Addicted to this world this language this landscapeI do n't love the violence but I feel I know the main characters so intimatelyI miss them when I can not be reading them ! I need to know what will become of them ! There are half a hundred possible outcomes that I can imagine and not all of them happy . ",4
"Even though the books are long each one pulls you in and when you are done you are ready for the next one ! Hurry up George and write book 6 ! ",4
"I honestly skimmed parts of book . Too many new people . Not as good as books before . Of course I read it and will read last bookbut parts of this got a little drawn outjust saying . ",3
"Love all of these books and this one ranks right up there with Game of Thrones as far as the entire collection goes . Excited to see where everything goes from here ! ",4
"I loved this book and at $ 5.99 is an absolute steal compared to the Hardcover . We bought the first 4 books in the series from Amazon for only $ 16.00 . Right now Costco is selling the entire 5Book series for $ 29.99.As for the actual book I think Martin should have added about 200 more pages to finish the story hence my downgrade.So many characters have been left out or omitted completely in this book but Martin explains this in the prologue.No doubt everything will be wrapped up in Book 6 and Book 7.Nevertheless I am completely mesmerized by this FF series and would recommend to anyone who 's a fan of Tolkien Steven King andor JK Rowling . ",3
"It took me an awful long time to read this book . I 'm not the fastest reader though . I usually only read right before bed and on my lunch hour . Ca n't get through a lot of pages that way . And this book is looooooooong but it 's ohso good . The author does such a great job describing scenery clothing foods smells that I could really picture everything . I love that about this author there are pages and pages of description . I know the show is a different animal but I can not wait to see which parts are used in the show and how they are adapted for cable tv . ",4
"I enjoyed reading this and loved finding out what happened to all the characters . Unfortunately I also found myself bored with reading it unlike previous books that I could n't put down . I wad a little disappointed with the development of some of the characters as well . Overall though it 's a good read and must for fans of the series . ",3
"I 'm always eager for the latest installment of of wellloved series . I bought the written form of this book the week it came out and purchased the audio version so my husband could enjoy it too . He travels a great deal . This series is hands down the BEST fantasy series out there . George R. R. Martin can write rings around Tolkein but if he does n't get off the stick and start cranking out more books he 's going to find that HBO will finish his story for him . ",4
"Reading this book has brought it full circle . Now i understand what the dance with dragons is ! Bravo mr. martin ! ",4
"I am stuck on this series . I loved this book too so ca n't wait to see the next one up . I will be grabbing it here too I m sure . ",4
"I have read the series this far so I am a fan . And only a dedicated fan should read this book . I love Martin 's writing but I have to say that this is by far the worst book he has written . Where were the editors ? It 's way too long and it fails to advance the story more than a millimeter . You could read the first chapter and the last chapter and skip everything in the middle because nothing happens ! Well it does but somehow it all seems very boring and predictable . The copy editing is sloppy with errors in grammar and overuse of the same words and phrases.This book should have been released as two books . Then the first book would have been released sooner it would have been shorter and the publisher would make twice a much money . The fans would be happy and the author not so burned out . I hope the next book is shorter tighter and more eventful . ",1
"His books get longer and longer but have less depth and story . You 'll get entire pages dedicated to family members they will never mention again . It 's like reading early chapters of the Bible and Mzdahr begat Lothar who begat Hizdahr whose second uncle was a great man of the fishing provincies and had three brothers named . WHO CARES ! ! ! ! I find myself skipping entire pages . He does the same thing with descriptions of places explaining every wall in a room Ok I get itflesh out your story . Do n't write a movie including screenplay and set design all in one . Needs to seriously learn how to edit out the crap or the for the next book I will only be reading the Cliff 's Notes version . ",1
"Read the middle 4 books of the Wheel of Time series again and DO N'T DO THAT . I say this because you are well on your way to writing a WoT clone in a bad way you started brilliantly but are now lost characters are standing around saying what 's my motivation ? you 're a Hollywood guy now you know what I 'm talking about . Dragons are on vacation in the hills or maybe they stomped off to their trailer in a huff of smoke . Get Tyrion off his party barge and send him to a celeb detox program so he gets his personality back worked for Ironman . Get the wolves of Winterfell howling you know they want to . And tell me that Jon somehow survived his Et tu Brute moment because he 's the only intersting character at the Wall right now ! Do n't follow in Jordan 's footsteps and write 4 books where the characters do NOTHING of note well yours do die but that 's not the kind of 'of note ' I 'm talking about you 've got one already with aDwD stop now ! You 've got a LOT of ground to cover yet so start trudging Winter is coming . ",2
"I 'm thoroughly sucked into this series . I began I to be interested from watching the 1st . Season on HBO . I stopped watching the series in order to read and finish the books first . I have now read all of the books that have been written thus far and I 'm anxiously awaiting the next in the series . And beginning to restart the watching of the series on HBO Go . ",4
"Books Three and Four had me literally skipping pages due to all of the secondary and tertiary characters I just did not care about . Why he chose to abandon Brandon and Brienne and focus on these characters kind of upset me.But Book Five brings it . Brings it back to what 's important to the fans . At least this fan . ",3
"I loved this book . It was well written and there was excitement surprise and mystery . I really wanted to savor it and make it last but I read it rather quickly and am about 14 way through a second read.I do n't quite understand all of the negative reviews . This is a transition book . It parallels another transition book . The plot can not advance beyond what the other book allows until the story lines catch up . Do n't you think that if any MAJOR events happened in these POV chapters the major characters in the other book would have heard about them ? The action moves exactly as much as it should considering the timeline and what 's happening elsewhere . We had three books before we 'll have at least two after so there is plenty of time to run the plotlines back together . Relax . Enjoy the story.In a story this large it ca n't be the pace of A Storm of Swords constantly . Plenty of very important things happened and beyond that the characters are primed to move the story forward rapidly as the threads all near one another . To me the plot moved along just fine . The more story that there is the more I get to enjoy . Sure I want to know the secrets we 've been waiting to know and I 'm also eager to see how this whole story plays out in the grand scheme of things . But I really like this story and just want to enjoy the journey . That 's okay with me . May not be and obviously is n't for many people.I think that some people are just upset because they 've spent years assuming they knew where the story was going or guessing at where it was going and then they realized that it 's not their story . It 's not wrapping up as quickly or neatly as they would have liked in the way they wanted it to.This book is also bleak . And dark . Winter is cruel and it 's coming fast . Hard decisions have to be made . Many of them are choices between bad and worse and you do n't know which is which.New twists misleading storylines I have no doubt and hard realities are woven throughout the prose which continues to improve.I 'm not telling you that you must like this book I 'm just saying that I liked it . My opinion is that it was great and that many people who have disliked it might have had expectations unfulfilled causing them to react negatively without regarding the story in light of what it really is and on the merits it has on its own . I 'm one of those who waited almost the entire 11 years for these plot arcs and characters to continue since ASOS . Believe me I 'm anxious for answers too . But I still really enjoyed this part of the story.Short story if you disliked A Feast For Crows you 'll probably be frustrated with this book . I like them both . A lot . ",4
"Like many readers I was smitten with the world Martin created inA Game of Thrones A Song of Ice and Fire Book 1 was caught up in the vivid showing of the battles and the intrigue inA Clash of Kings HBO Tiein Edition A Song of Ice and Fire Book Two and was impressed by his ruthlessness towards his characters inA Storm of Swords A Song of Ice and Fire Book 3 . As with many readers and fans I cut Martin some slack inA Feast for Crows A Song of Ice and Fire Book 4 the storyline was just too big apparently for a single book . A rationale I thought reasonable and although the storyline moved at a glacial pace I had high hopes for some resolution of loose ends from Book 4 and some forward movement in _A Dance with Dragons_ . Were that it was so . _A Dance with Dragons_ was in many ways an utter disappointment.That is not to say I found Book 5 a total bust . To avoid spoilers I 'll write in broad terms . I did like the wider sense of geopolitics Martin develops here as the conflict in Westeros has ramifications in the Free Cities and Valyria . It was a relief to see the storylines that had diverged in _A Feast for Crows_ again rejoin each other and readers are given a longer perspective of the political web that the game of thrones is princes thought long dead instead found in hiding old alliances and old rivalries between noble houses uncovered details of storylines from the first four books particularly around Daenyrs brought to light . In a perverse way I also liked the lack of resolution of some of the story lines tantalizing clues left about what will happen with Daenerys Arya the dragons characters in difficult situations that I am anxious to see solved Jon on the Wall Bran Beyond the Wall and Jamie and Brienne in the Riverlands . As much as I enjoyed this it was not enough to earn more than a mediocre review.There are many more points that I take issue with than there are redeeming features . First is the geologic pace at which the story moves . At just under 1000 pages I had expected more forward movement of the plot . This did not happen . Stannis remains in the North . Daenerys remains in Slaver 's Bay . Tyrion for much of the story is at sea and so on ad nauseum with all the characters . Books One and Two moved much more quickly and which I liked much more.. Perhaps juggling 23 story lines has simply become untenable for Martin to maintain . Another issue I had concerned the changes in authenticity of several of the characters . While I recognize characters do and should change across the story line Martin has several of his characters take almost 180 degree turns from who they were in the first four books especially Jon The Night 's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms and Tyrion . I also expected at least some sort of chekcing in with other characters from _A Feast for Crows_ would happen once the storylines from Book 4 was reunited in Book 5 specifically the happenings and goings on of Sansa and Samwell Tarley . It looks like readers will have to wait for the next installment to see what these characters have been up to . In a similar vein Jamie was hardly mentioned at all.The divergence of story lines between Books 4 and 5 was a challenge as well . As a relative new comer to the series I had the advantage of being able to read the books more or less concurrently I pity those who had to wait over four years between books but even then I frequently found myself going back to _A Feast for Crows_ to reacquaint myself with characters and their stories that I had fogotten all about it having been 500 or 600 or in the case of Daenyrs almost 900 pages since last they were a part of the story . Some sort of prologue other than the pointless prologue involving Wargs and apprentice maesters recaping the story thus far would have been helpful I think.As much as I am tempted to give _A Dance with Dragons_ a onestar rating I ca n't . This is a work in progress I remain hopeful that once the Song of Fire and Ice is completed my objections and complaints will be inconsequential . While I remain frustrated that the story has moved so little over the last two books I also remain optimistic that there will be a payoff in the books to come . Those expectations aside for a 1000 page investment in reading there is precious little payoff for audiences here . ",1
"Excellent continuation of series although somr pov 's missing because of split with Feast . I liked it better on reread after also listening to the audiobook . ",4
"A welcome return to the deep complexities of the first three novels and away from the repetitive fourth tale . The story of Bran becomes more developed and stranger and that of Jon shows a stronger character . Daenerys is still waiting in the wings and it is not yet clear how she and Jon and Tyrion will intersect . ",4
"Such promise in A Game of Thrones . So much anticipation in A Clash of Kings . The warning signals came for me in A Storm of Swords the ratio of story versus rich fabric was reversed and it was perpetuated in A Feast of Crows . I was prepared to abandon the series right then but did n't Martin promise to make it right in A Dance With Dragons ? Instead Martin wrote as if he had no idea where his runaway project was going . Oh and the HBO screenplay is still worse . ",0
"I started this series riveted unable to put the books down even after the author killed Eddard Stark . There were plots within plots that kept you on your toes but this book should have tied together better than it did . There were too many characters too loosely connected and the reader is left wondering to much . What happened to King Stannis Jaime Jon.. ? ? ? ? ? I hope the next book if there is one somehow can pull all of the characters together without killing all of them off . ",2

"So I just finished ploughing my way through all 5 of the Song of Fire and Ice books and I 'm regretfully finding myself in agreement with many of the other reviews here . Despite the breathless reviews posted on the back cover hailing George RR Martin as the American JRR Tolkein what he 's shaping up to be is the next Robert Jordan . This is not a good thing.Like the late Mr. Jordan whose Wheel of Time series was strung out horrifically padded with useless new characters and endless descriptions of clothing and basically milked for all the new volumes it could sell until the author lamentably died before he was anywhere close to a conclusion the Song of Fire and Ice series is showing disturbingly parallel tendencies . While the series started reasonably strong in the first book or two by book 5 it 's clear the author has no idea where he 's going does n't know how to keep the plot moving anymore or even build suspense except by the soapoperalike device of continually having characters you think he 's killed off amazingly resurrected sometimes offstage so you have no idea how this actually occurred and he still maddeningly pads out his prose with endless lists of clans and the heraldry of all those present at any event whether or not those people will actually play a part in the subsequent plot.And like Robert Jordan it is looking as if the author is likely to expire before he can finish . Even in his book jacket photo on Dance With Dragons which would normally be expected to show the author in the most flattering light Mr. Martin does not look well . I am certainly not wishing any ill health on him but I really wish he 'd just get on with it and wrap up all the various plot lines in one final climactic book . Robert Jordan would have written a modern masterpiece if he 'd had the willpower to make it a 6book series George RR Martin would be welladvised to do so.This is really a failure of editing . It 's an understandable problem once an author becomes a wildlysuccessful bestseller no editor has the power or the guts to say George this is a piece of longwinded crap that does n't go anywhere . Take it back and cut it by 50 % and tighten up all the plotlines . But I guess they figure they 'll sell a lot more books this way.As long as the author can survive the experience.Bottom line I think I 'll wait until I hear that the series has actually been completed before I purchase another volume .

"I finished A Dance with Dragons a few weeks ago after reading books 1 through 4 just over a year earlier . When I logged on to see the reviews for the book I decided to sort them by date and I found that all negative reviews are overwhelmingly helpful and all positive reviews overwhelmingly unhelpful . Is there a cult of antiGRRM reviewers just sitting at their computers clicking unhelpful at every reviewer who liked this book ? Seriously get a life and move on . If you did n't like the book then fine that 's your opinion and you are welcome to it . So write your scathing review about how George has turned into a cash cow and about how bad the editing is and how nothing at all happens in the book and then move on with your lives . By sitting around and bumping up all of the negative reviews it just proves that you care so much about this series good or bad that you feel the need to stalk the review page night and day to leave your feedback . So do n't bother saying that you are done with the series because you know darn well that you will be first in line at the bookstore when book 6 is released.If that first paragraph made you angry then just go ahead and click unhelpful but if you are just going to sit here all day anyway then you might as well read the rest of my review . Are there any Tolkien fans out there ? I ask because most people do n't recall that the Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings took 12 years to write . That 's right it took Tolkien 12 years to write 4 books . Sound familiar ? The fact is that the time it took to write a series means absolutely nothing when the series is finally completed . 60 years after the completion of The Lord of the Rings it is held as the pinnacle of the fantasy genre . When all is said and done and GRRM has finally finished A Song of Ice and Fire it will be held up as the best fantasy series since Tolkien and I have absolutely no doubt about that . The reason for the disappointment is because each individual book can not meet the reader 's expectations after such a long wait between books . If you had just finished The Two Towers after a 4 year wait I 'm sure you would be disappointed with that too and how nothing got resolved . That fact is that no one read Tolkien as the books were being released . What must have seemed a curse at the time turned into a blessing as Tolkien 's works became popular in the 70 's and people read the books all at once judging them as one large work . The same thing will happen with GRRM when the Song is finally completed and people start to read the series as one large work without long waits and building expectations between books.Sorry for the rambling review but I gasp actually enjoyed A Dance with Dragons . Was it as good as books 1 through 3 ? No not quite hence the 4 stars instead of 5 . Was it better then book 4 ? Yes it was and it is also head and shoulders above 99 percent of all other fantasy period . GRRM will finish the Song at his own pace and when it is all finally completed Dance will have its own special place in the series . It is a book of transition and growth . It is a book where Westeros recovers from the War of the Five Kings . It is a book where Jon and Dany learn that with leadership comes great responsibility and hardship . It is a book where despicable characters are redeemed and where villainous ones grow even more hated in the reader 's mind . It is a book that held me like no other book I had read in the past year and it reminded me of why I love this series so darn much . I will admit that I was a little disappointed in the end . Not disappointed in the Dance itself but disappointed that I would have to wait a very long time to see the final fates of my favorite characters . However I am confident that 20 years from now I will be sitting contently in a cozy chair next to a warm fire revisiting the events of this beautiful series after it is finally completed and the agony and disappointment of waiting between books will be nothing but a distant memory .

"Look these main characters are really good . We all know by now that Martin can write and he 's not afraid to take leaps that many other writers would never dream of and I applaud that but there are some serious problems here . First it is beyond obvious that Mr. Martin is milking this series out . The last book did literally NOTHING to advance the plot or solidify main characters . Another problem is THERE ARE ENTIRELY TOO MANY CHARACTERS . With it taking so long between books you forget the minor char 's and what has happened . I 'm not at all opposed to an author killing off main characters if it develops the plot or has meaning in some way . However so far we 've seen only 2 main char 's deaths actually mean something relevant to the story . Its like this author is killing main characters just to prove to the reading community or more likely his peers that he is n't afraid to go against the grain . RR Martin is seriously in danger of the Robert Jordan and George Lucas curse in that their popularity has those working with them and for them afraid to do AND constructive editing at all . Someone needs to tell RR Martin to let an editor methodically work thru his drafts to make them better . When I was reading the Wheel of Time books I started wondering who the hell is editing this drivel then I found out it was his wife . Fans of your work are n't the best to add constructive criticism . I can honestly say I think I am done with these books just like I stopped on book 4 of Wheel of Time . ",2
"Goes deeper yet into the wars for the seven kingdoms . Waiting for the next chapter to unfold . Too many twists and turns to describe . ",4
"After five years GRR Martin finally decides to grace us with another book the same time HBO comes out with the TV show . As a fellow fan I ca n't help but pick it up to figure out what happens to the story . But did anything really happen ? That 's an arguable point.Let 's talk about the enjoyable things before getting to the more unpleasant parts of this reviewMartin is a great writer . No matter how slow the story is moving I still did n't want to put the book down . Martin 's writing really brings the world to life . His descriptions of cities and markets and people makes a vivid image in your mind . In the current fictions climate where descriptions are minimal it is a refreshing change but it could also be annoying to the readers who are used to action action and action books instead of a book that brings the world alive with vivid details.It is also hard to think of exceptionally good things about this book just because this is mainly a book that pushes things along at a snail pace . As others have stated things can happen much faster . There 're just chapters and chapters and chapters of events that were useless . Spoiler ahead For example from the beginning to the end war threatens Mereen but does it actually happen ? No . With this long of a book you 'd think there would be more lifechanging well at least more surprising twists around the corner . I 'm not saying there arent but there are just not enough for the length of this book.Martin does have a way to grip readers if only because I want to know what happens even though nothing happens chapter after chapter . After every page for every chapter I keep hoping something important will happen but usually I am left with disappointment . Yet still I go on reading because I do care . I still care about the characters old and the new.Nothing much left to say . If you read the previous ones and is a fan then it 's a must read if only to continue the series . If not then you should n't be looking at this review . Read the first book and decide for yourself . ",3
"I think George R. R. Martin was hungry when he wrote A Dance with Dragons . It 's odd but the thing I remember is page after page describing food . The problem is that outside of eating the characters really do n't do anything else . Indeed it 's the only thing they can do while traveling from one spot to another . The problem is that they never seem to reach their destinations . Other than the ending there 's a whole bunch of nothing going on . Quite a disappointment for everyone who waited years for this tome . Even Tyrion ca n't save this stinker.I was really hopeful that the previous book A Feast for Crows was the rare rotten exception to this otherwise fantastic series but sadly it was n't . The series has become way too fragmented and unfocused . Martin has become a victim of his own success seemingly unable to edit anything from this lengthy volume . I rarely say this but I think the TV show will be better than the book . So far HBO has managed to do a superb job in whittling down a lot of Martin 's narrative bloat.I think it says everything that I bought this book the day it came out and it was n't until almost a year later when I forced myself to finish it . Sadly it became a chore . I 'm still a fan and hope Martin can rekindle the series in the next volume but I 'm afraid it might have already jumped the shark . ",1
"As a longtime of fan of the work of George RR Martin I have of course read every single book of his epic work Songs of Fire and Ice . Creating a complicated medievallike world of knights and bloody battles Martin 's work is always both confusing and mesmerizing . This the fifth in the neverending I hope series is another massive 1000page saga covering not only the original fictional continent Westeros but including ever more lands and peoples all generated by the fecund mind of Martin . Rivaling Dickens in his imaginative names and parade of characters Martin has truly outdone himself in this last book . I heartily recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy or even to anyone who loves fiction . It helps to have read all the other volumes as they mesh and interlink so beautifully but this book can also stand on its own . ",4
"He fancies himself Tolkein however he 's just another wannabe even going so far as to add the second R to his name . He even borrows some things from LOTR for example his Kings Moot compared to Tolkeins Ent Moot . Tolkein was smart keeping the story moving and ending it in three books . Martin will be lucky to finish in seven books if at all . The fourth book was very disappointing because what happened to all the characters ? ? ? ? ? ? I gave it one star should be a 0 since I 'm done now I 've lost interest and wo n't buy any more . ",0
"I was n't more than forty pages into this latest failure of GRMMs when I realised how repetitive and lacking of story advancement it was . It is so full of loose ends a professional seamstress could tie them up . Martins problem is he no longer controls the story the story is controlling him . He appears to be writing whatever garbage pops into his head to fill pages and hopefully find a conclusion one where he can pick it up for the continuance Winds.I 'd like to know if the timeleine of The Winds of Winter will be before Dance with Dragons because in the main part of the book DWD a raven arrives from Lord Ramsey advising that Stannis and his army have been wiped out but in the first pages of Winds we have Stannis back planning his attack on Winterfell . If a boring book that you can skip every second line interests you buy it otherwise give it a BIG miss . Everything that needed to be said in the storyline was said in the first three books.Will I buy Winds no way I might venture to the libary and take it out just to see if he can put an end to this horrific saga.I awarded it two stars on the basis one for content and story and one for length . 1099 pages plus the epilogue a total of 1117 a mammoth effort of writing in circles .

"Although I love these books # 5 is not my favorite not enough Ayra & other favorites for me and too many new characters I do n't care about . Also too much fighting detail and not enough dyrewolves ! Finally when will Dany reach the west and have meaningful interactions with hwe ",3
"Here is my advice If you love the HBO series on television then buy the books and read them . Or if you like stuff like King Arthur Merlin Medieval Times Tolkein then you will enjoy . Just an epic adventure ! With the sex and violence comes the caution that these books are NOT for kids . I think I would say 18+ on the books if your children are asking for them.Only critique is that there are SO many characters added and so many places in the realm I sometimes find myself referring back to another book or to the maps which can be kind of fun too ! . I also missed some of the characters that he killed off or those that did n't make the cut to this book . Ca n't wait for the next one ! Brilliant Author ! ",4
"There is an old story of a fanatical golfer whose partner died on the 10th hole . After returning to the clubhouse he shares with his other buddies the fact of his golf partner 's death . When asked what he did after his partner died he said There was nothing else I could do it was hit the ball and drag Charley ! That 's how I feel about getting through this book . I read the other four of Martin 's books and so I wanted to finish the series . But I must say this one is a chore . I want to get it done to merely to be able to say I read them all so I read for awhile and then switch over to another book just as a change of pace . I come back read a few more chapters and then find another book to read for awhile . But I swear to you the reader I plan to finish it someday . ",2
"Stannis Baratheon marches on Winterfell from the Wall . Daenerys 's empire is threatened from within . Tyrion finds himself enslaved . Cercei finds herself in chains . The Crow 's Eye desires Daenerys for his own but so do several other wouldbe suitors . And Jon Snow faces dissent from his brothers of the WatchIn the latest installment of Incest and Intrigue more of the pieces are placed on the board . Daenerys ca n't trust anyone . Jon Snow ca n't trust anyone . Iron Lords can not trust their own brothers . Sellswords in general can not be trusted . In short no one can trust anyone while the Game of Thrones is being played.This one had its share of memorable moments both good and ill . I really like how Arya 's story is developing but I do n't see how it 's going to tie back into things . The revelation of Young Griff 's true identity was a game changer and its repercussions will be felt in the next couple books . I liked that Brienne is still alive and that Jaime Lannister chose to follow her instead of rushing to Cercei 's defense . Jon Snow getting knifed on the Wall by his sworn brothers did n't sit well with me . I 'm really hoping he 's still alive come next book whenever that may be.It looks like Theon is headed for redemption but I 'd rather see him dead or taking the black . Bran is progressing nicely . Whatever happened to Ricken and that bastard of Robert 's that is n't Gendry ? And who is Cercei 's new champion Robert Strong the Mountain perhaps ? I honestly do n't think Martin will be able to wrap things up in two more books not with all the balls he has in the air . Plus it would be all too easy for him to throw more players into the mix to keep the saga going . Still with A Song of Ice and Fire George R.R . Martin has made an Oathbreaker out of me . I once swore I 'd never get caught up in a neverending fantasy series . In fact I believe I said I 'd rather eat my own testicles . However I 'm pretty caught up in this one . Now if you 'll excuse me I 'm off to join the tent city on George R.R . Martin 's front lawn to wail and gnash my teeth every night until the next book is ready . ",3
"Despite the author being an indescribably evil man who feeds on the tears of his fans the book is great as usual . And best of all now none of you @ # $ @ # can spoil me on the show since I 've already spoiled myself reading the books . ",4
"This is one of those series where it just feels like the author grew to hate everything to do with the world he had created and started wantonly slaughtering the main characters with no thought as to how he was going to fill in the gaps that they left in the story . Between the 5 years it took him to write this and the fact that he is off writing another series of books now I would DEFINITELY advise against buying anything that this author writes until he completely finishes the series or you might just get burned like so many have . Oh and what was the deal with the so many chapters being dedicated to shallow boring characters that had no influence on the overall story . It felt to me like they were just there to add extra chapters to an overly long book in a series that will in all likely hood never be finished due to the author dying of old age half way through the 7th book . That and I do n't know about you but I do n't fee like waiting another decade for books six and seven to be released . ",0
"I have read any reviews for this book and any stressed the message that this was a disappointment and lacked the action of the first three novels . After reading this I will admit it is n't as eventful but it adds a whole new level to Martin 's world . This novel acts as a set up piece for Martin 's sure to be classic final chapters . I can see why people are angry especially since they waited so long for this volume but a work this big requires time . That being said I ca n't wait for the next volume and the resolutions of the many cliffhangers . ",3
"I am completely convinced that the author of A Dance with Dragons is not the same person who wrote A Game of Thrones A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords . Here 's my reasoning . Take the book A Storm of Swords . Open it to any page . Now open A Dance with Dragons to the same page number . Read the page in A Storm of Swords and immediately read the page of A Dance with Dragons . Repeat this process three of four times . A simliar comparison of A Dance with Dragons to A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings is worth the effort.Compare the use of dialog narrative and even punctuation . The difference is amazing is n't it . Most reviews are complaining that A Dance with Dragons is a poor companion to the first three books in the series based on plot and lack of forward momentum but no one is addressing the reason behind the slip in quality . My take is that the difference in the very mechanics of writing between A Dance with Dragons and the first three books is so dramatic the it could not possibly be written by the same author.So who wrote A Dance with Dragons ? If it was truly George R. R. Martin then who wrote the first three books ? It just ca n't be the same guy . ",0
"I picked up the first book and loved it . The second book was okaybut did n't have a purpose beyond expanding the storythen we got into books three to five . Great storiesbut no reason for themnew characters coming out of the wood work and not advancing the plot . This last book was hopelessly the worse one yetnothing happened and the characters never got beyond doing stuffTo be honest George R.R . Martin is a great writer and should stick to short stories or he needs to go back to writing 101 and learn to develop a novelor just go back to book onehe did so much better there . ",0

"Who does not like this series ? I was skeptical but he is such a good creator of very indepth characters and an amazing world . ",4
"I will not forgive GRRM for not killing off Cersei in some horrible way . IF this series goes on long enough if I live long enough to see it happen maybe Tommen will grow up and realize what a treacherous bitch his mother is and have her beheaded for trying to harm Margery . The only reasons I read this book were to find out what happened to Bran the true lord of Winterfell and to find out how Cersei died . SOL on both counts . ",1
"This series is excellent . Ca n't wait for the future books . As it progressed the twists and turns increased with many unexpected events . ",4
"It has been SIX LONG YEARS since George R.R . Martin last released a book in his Song Of Ice And Fire Sequence . That 's a pretty long wait.So was A Dance with Dragons A Song of Ice and Fire Book Five worth the wait ? Well yes and no . It returns to muchbeloved characters like Tyrion Bran and Daenarys and slowly moves us toward the complex treacherous endgame of Westeros ' power struggles . But it 's also very slowmoving and sometimes it feels like events are happening too slowly.After killing his father Tyrion flees his native land and ends up adrift in another dependent on others for safety and shelter . So instead he forges a new destiny for himself . Meanwhile Bran is en route to the Wall only to run into wargs and discover new facets of his mysterious skinchanging power.The new Night Watch commander Jon Snow finds himself facing an incoming horde of wildlings as well as the presence of grouchy King Stannis and his bloodthirsty priestess Melisandre . Jon is determined to keep doing what he thinks is right but his steadfastness may also be his undoing.Having conquered the city of Meereen Daenarys starts learning the ropes of queenship there as well as caring for her three rapidlygrowing dragons . Of course she soon discovers that it 's a lot harder than it sounds as she becomes enmeshed in a deadly tangle of love treason ambition and bloody murder.It 's honestly hard to sum up a George R.R . Martin 's books without giving away far too much or going into countless detailed subplots . However this book is very slow moving and there is n't a lot of forward momentum until the last several chapters . It feels like Martin is arranging his vast chessboard for a the final clash but it 's going to be slow moving until he 's done.However for a Martin book even moving forward slowly is a striking experience . He embroiders this bloodspattered tapestry with vivid poetic prose prose he fluttered like a burning leaf a moth caught in a candle flame mingled with sex and quite a bit of gruesome violence handled very casually when a man is beheaded someone asks Can I have his boots ? .The only very flawed scene that springs to mind is Daenarys ' final scene which is so melodramatic as to be almost silly . And yes it ends on a multiple cliffhanger . Prepare to scream in frustration.As for the vast cast of flawed intriguing characters Martin only handles some of them we see more of Bran 's burgeoning powers as he grows into a young man Jon 's bleak frustrating life as a commander the everembittered Tyrion afloat without his family 's influence and Daenarys ' quiet nature at war with her dragon 's blood . Well he touches on some of the other characters such as Cersei who hits rock bottom but mostly focuses on those four . And without revealing too much yet another muchloved character seems to have bitten the proverbial dust.A Dance of Dragons dances too slowly but it 's still a deeply absorbing read and it feels like George R.R . Martin is arranging the grand finale . Let 's hope the next book does n't take six years . ",3

"This books dust jacket proudly mentions that George R. R. Martin is known as the American Tolkien . With all due respect besides both working in the genre of middle age fantasy they have almost nothing in common . The Tolkien trilogy was published in its entirety in less than two years . The complete story adhered to traditional rules of storytelling with a beginning buildup climax and ending and the reader knew the general path the story was going down and what an expected conclusion would look like destroying the Ring of Doom while Martin 's book is essentially just a chronicling of events in sort of a swords and sorcery soap opera . Martin is now in his fifth book with at least two more planned . The first book was publishing in 1996 and at this pace would likely not finish before 2023 meaning it would optimistically span 27 years and that 's IF Martin actually ends the series after seven books as he 's predicting . I think there 's pretty good odds the series may get extended . My copy of the Lord of the Rings trilogy is 1008 pages long 32 pages less than A Dance with Dragon 's . The audio disc for this book is over TWO SOLID DAYS LONG ! ! ! There is an appendix at the end of the book with a couple lines of dialogue describing each character . It 's 53 pages long . In other works Tolkein 's masterpiece is a quick sprint compared to Martin ultra marathon.I finally finished the marathon that is ` A Dance With Dragons ' and all the criticisms that have been leveled again George R.R . Martin are on display here . Martin is all over the place introducing storylines and characters and then dropping them . This book is the compliment to ` A Feast for Crows ' focusing on the characters and storylines omitted from that book . We revisit Bran Stark Jon Snow Tyrion Lannister . So after 959 pages what exactly happened ? Let me just say a lot less than one might expect given the length . Martin 's writing is as superb as always and this may be his best yet but he writes like he suffers from attention deficit disorder . The storyline with Bran was quite intriguing but before the half way point of the book it just stops . Likewise we spend a bit of time with Davos Seaworth before Martin seems to just forget he exists . Of all the storylines the one with Stannis Baratheon was the one that had me the most riveted but with several hundred pages left in the book Martin stopped writing about Stannis leaving his fate for the next book.Ah the next book ` The Winds of Winter ' . Based on the writer 's current pace I would expect it no earlier than 2017 at which point all the cliffhangers will be distant memories . Martin spends a bit of time in the latter half of the book on the OTHER half of the characters Cersei Jamie Arya etc.. It had been so long since I 'd read ` A Feast for Crows ' that I 'd completely forgotten that Cersei had been imprisoned . It 's really hard to be on the edge of your seat for 6 years . It 's not that I 'm asking George Martin to crank up his productivity but I wish he could focus . The storyline with Davos could have been jettisoned with no effect on the greater book and he is just one of a ton of extraneous characters including Victarion Greyjoy and Quenyn Martell that do little to advance the main storyline . Martin is so good with characterization it feels blasphemous to ask him to trim characters but there has to be a limit or this series will never end which would be tragic for those who have stuck with it for 15 years.As might be evident by the title this book focuses on Daenerys Targaryen and her three dragons who are getting closer to full maturity . Many of the surrounding storylines revolve around this central thread . Tyrion has long since been my favorite character and he 's used tremendously but sadly his role is essentially inconsequential and again could probably have been trimmed . We get to peer within the very mysterious Lady Melisandre but again Martin only seems to tease and just when I really wanted to see more of her Martin gave me less . Sometimes I wonder if I regret ever getting into the series and not because it 's bad but because it 's so good . Time will tell whether we actually ever see an ending but I shall try and patiently wait for the next book and see if my memory can last the length of time until it 's published . ",4

"This series started out great then the second book was ok the third and fourth were pretty bad . This one is middling good . It started out as if it were on fire then the end totally bit . Once again characters who are good and honorable and likeable end up dead . What is Martin 's problem ? Is he clinically depressed ? People have called him the American Tolkien hah . No way . He does n't have half the talent . It seems as if he 's making this up as he goes along . Everytime he seems to have written himself into a corner he pulls some rabbit out of his hat and goes off in another silly direction . I may not even read the rest of the series until it 's in the Kindle bargain bin . I 'm really tired of the endless ways he finds to just drag things out . It snows so everyone stops . We sail from here to there . Even Tyrion is starting to be a boring character . Unlike the Lord of the Rings which this ca n't even hold a remote candle to I get no sense of history from this . He throws a bunch of names about events about how about a LOTR like timeline in the back of the book rather than those endlessly dull repeats of the houses . Does anyone really not know who Robert Strong is ? I 'm surprised he even killed of Tywin Lannister since he seems to hold such love for the evil characters . Now what he does at the wall and leave us hanging well I 'm fed up with this crap . It took him six years to write this ? I think he has a dart board in his office and he hits it and says Ok that 'll happen . This started with such promise and it 's going down hill so fast . The sad thing is for at least half the book it was far better than 3 and 4 the ended just like them . Also little tidbits like Brienne showing up for two paragraphs are not fulfilling . Now we have to wait ? Where 's Bran 's little brother ? I 'm rapidly not giving a damn . I wish Daneyrs would show up with all three dragons and lay waste to all of Westeros so this whole endlessly needing some serious editing series would come to an end . Color me unhappy . ",1
"a caveat from me I did not get into these books until I watched HBO 's A Game of Thrones . At the shows finale I jumped into book 2 and subsequently tore through all the rest concluding with the just read A Dance with Dragons . I.e . there 's been no years between books for me roughly 3800 pages over the summer.Given the connectionsplit of AFFC and ADWD I 'd have to say that AFFC and ADWD should not have been split and Martin 's Editor should have insisted it be condensed and edited to move the story along . Be that as it may I thought the pace and focus of ADWD was much better than AFFC.I am starting to wonder how he 's going to bring all his disparate characters & locations into any sort of conclusion . In trying to keep this spoiler free I can only be vague in wondering how everyone reconnects in Westeros to settle the game of thrones at play and the song of ice and fire being sung from the wall down to dorne across the narrow sea in braavos and the grass sea outside of meereen . I can only guess at howif Ned Stark 's remaining children will come back together and reclaim the north . For that matter will House Targaryen get it together and locate the other two riders needed to saddle up the dragons and reclaim the iron throne ? here 's for hoping HBO does not catch up to the next book before it 's written and published .

"This story line of this book goes on and on and has no ending . All the kingdoms are left in chaos with no end in sight . Because of this I would not recommend this book or the series to anyone . It was very disappointing and the fact of the matter is I felt like I wasted my time reading all five books . ",1
"It was a absolutely chore to dig through this book . I did not read it because it was enjoyable only because I intend to read the next book and missing a hole can be difficult . I hope that Martin has not reached the hubris of Lucas where he begins taking a colossal dump on the good will he built up because no editor has enough stones to tell him that he needs to make some cuts.While I blame the last two book on the author this is really a failure of the editor . An editor should be willing to tell even a strong author that cuts need to be made and areas tightened up . This is his Phantom Menace pray there is no Attack of the Clones to follow . ",1
"NO SPOILERSWhat could possibly go wrong with a book sporting the word Dragons in the title a cool shield that looks like the back of a Mexican peso and the fact that it 's authored by George RR Martin ? Quite a bit unfortunately.As has apparently been the case with many readers finishing A DANCE WITH DRAGONS left me with mixed feelings.On the one hand we get to see some of our favorite characters and the story start to move forward towards greater things.Considering the long 6 years between books I was pleasantly surprised to find that Martin still knows how to equip Tyrion with the cleverest quips and leave the reader begging for the next installment in the series.Unfortunately the vast majority of the book leading up to the end feltno WASextremely drawn out . Just when you start thinking to yourself Yes ! The plot is finally moving forward ! No Martin takes character A or B and sends them off on a tangent . And even this would n't be so bad except for the fact that these tangents were rather boring unless you like reading about cyvasse games and menus of fantasy fare.In addition to main characters chasing rainbows and wasting time Martin throws in the perspective of several other minor characters . Granted some of these characters we 've met in previous volumes but do they really deserve the spotlight so late in the game ? To sum up my feelings for this book it 's one you 'd want to read only once only so you 're fully prepared for what I 'm hoping will be a far superior book 6.Finally as the title of my review states this book ends with a laugh but you wo n't find it within the main body of the text . It 's at the very end of the book and in my opinion is all the convincing I need that Martin is in serious need of an editor.George R.R . Martin sold his first story in 1971 and has been writing professionally every since . ",2
"For The Winds of Winter . Of course Martin has again hooked me into hanging on for the next nailbiter lathered and rabid to learn what is next to befall the characters I love and those I love to hate.Did ADWD answer all or even most of the questions I carry or even give proper time in my opinion to characters I desired progress and movement with ? Well no . Did the novel exceed my expectations by annihilating my expectations and proving that Martin is the master of ASOIAF ? Without doubt . If nothing else this novel blew the lid off the scope I thought I had on this world giving me a greater admiration for Martin 's vision and ability to bring that to his audience with artistry . This is a great big world with great big characters and with this installment Martin proves again that his great big series has plenty of juice.Whilst I did read this one slower first time through clever monkey catches the clues I once again lost nearly a night of sleep as the final third of the book was inescapably unputdownable . Martin 's lovely prose and careful character development are stunning in this installment and he does offer fans a bit of karmic satisfaction though admittedly not nearly enough for my bloodthirsty self . Of course there are even more cliffhangers and even less resolution with additional storylines but I prefer to look at it as all the more to love.I can not fathom what it is that motivates some of the controversy and acrimony of some of the other fans and reviewers especially those airing grievances about the time it took to publish the fate of their fav characters the Tolkien comparisons the list of the utter ridiculous complaints could go on and on . I will not presume to speak to any of these but to say that in reading through the naysaying I found myself struck by Martin 's infamous words are wind line and how apropos the words feel in this instance . Stop whining and rise up all you irritated shortchanged readers and really stick it to the man write and publish your own international best selling series do everything right and show everyone how it is done . We will surely all be the better for your example.For my part rather than taking Martin 's decisions as the storyteller or the length of time he requires to produce a finished product as some manner of personal affront I will thank the man for having a brilliant imagination and outstanding ability as a storyteller and hope he is at the bloody laptop at this very minute cranking out copious pages on TWOW .

"Dance with Dragons was better than Feast For Crows.Feast for Crows felt so mundane in parts with boring perspectives from Dorne and the Iron Islands . Throughout I wanted to yell I DO N'T CARE ! GO BACK TO ARYA ! And so on.Dance with Dragons was a little bit better but of course it 's a parallel to Feast for Crows which means some of the stories I DID like were left unresolved . We still have the boring Dorne stories which it was all I could do to keep from clicking right on through.The stories of Jon Snow and Reek made it worth it . After Sam manipulated Jon into the position of Lord Commander we see how political being in charge is and how Jon is constantly having to balance the needs of the wall with the entitlement from Stannis and his followers . We also see how precarious his position is and how isolated being commander has made him . Ned Stark 's presence is felt here though even four books later particularly where Janos Slynt is involved favorite scene in the book ! .The character of Reek is new but not really . I 'm trying to keep this review mostly spoiler free so I wo n't say too much except that an earlier character has completely changed to an almost Gollum effect.Notice I do n't mention Dany or Tyrion . I felt like the instant Tyrion left Westeros he became boring . Sure he still has his wit but he 's truly too clever a character to be anywhere but a thorn in Cersei 's side . I had fully expected to learn that he 'd been behind Cersei 's imprisonment the whole time or something like that . His development was disappointing.Dany had never been one of my favorite characters . Sure her dragons are interesting but she 's always felt a bit Mary Sue to metoo idealogical . Here I felt she was onenote where her stories bored me about as much as the Iron Island stories did.Obviously A Song of Ice and Fire has ballooned . Martin has wonderful tittilating characters and great plot twists . But it seems when he killed off several main characters in A Storm of Swords he also killed off his reasons the stories were interesting.I 'm hoping The Winds of Winter brings back Arya as she is meant to be that my worries about Jon are for naught that Reek continues to make waves that Sansa is eventually reunited with SOMEONE from her family that Brienne does n't kill Jaime that Cersei dies a horrible death that Dany becomes more interesting that Tyrion goes back to Westeros with his head still on that Sam becomes a Maester and sheesh so much more.I will read every book as it comes out but I 'm hoping the sixth book is of the caliber as Storm of Swords .

"I was addicted to this series and thought I would never tire of reading new installments . But the last two books have become so dark and brutal that I no longer look forward to returning to the story . There is no denying author Martin 's stunning descriptive powers in particular the detailing of Tyrion 's river trip through the eerily fogbound Sorrows with its massive crumbling palace and ruined statuary looming in the mist . However there are simply too many sinners in his books and too few saints . In this survivalofthefittest civilization and I use that word loosely there is far more cruelty than kindness . SOME contrast would be nice . I closed the book before finishing it . I 've found Westeros and its world too grim squalid desperate and violent to want to visit again . ",2
"It was not until the end of book 4 that George R.R . Martin stated that Books 4 & 5 would cover different characters with correlating events . This book helped answer a lot of questions I had after confusion from book 4 and cliff hangers from book 3 . It is well worth the read though it is heavy ! ",4
"UpdateI 've noticed many of the 13 star reviews are written by individuals who either skipped entire chapters in this book did n't finish the book or in some extreme cases did n't read A Feast for Crows . I appreciate the full disclosure but I do n't believe that a reviewer can offer a meaningful credible review without completing the reviewed work in its entirety . I read both AFFC and ADWD completely and I enjoyed both books . Not everyone will enjoy them but I imagine that anyone who skips whole chapters or even whole books will without exception write a negative review . You would have to be critical of it before even starting to skip some of the stories and skipping passages would likely not improve your opinion . I found that characters I cared nothing about before starting this book like Victarion Greyjoy became some of my favorites I would never have known these plots would come to interest me had I skipped chapters I did n't eagerly await . Similarly had I skipped AFFC I would never even have come in contact with Victarion before starting ADWD.ReviewMartin should have cut the book off as soon as the timelines from AFFC and ADWD converged chronologically . Or alternatively completed some of the timelines that end abruptly and in some cases with an easily discernable next step instead of truncating them at 1530 % completion . The former would have made a shorter but still long ! book the latter would have made a substantially longer but better book.Massive spoilers ahead.Some of the plotlines that should have been carried through1 . Cersei 's trial . Ser Robert Strong will certainly win . And in the same vein it 's fairly clear that Ser Robert Strong is a resurrected or preserved Ser Gregor Clegane.2 . Aegon 's attack on Storm 's End.3 . Barristan 's battle at Meereen.4 . Victarion 's arrival in Meereen . Why end with him floating in the straits ? 5 . Bran 's further learning from Bloodraven . Seemed to end abruptly in the middle of the teaching.5 . Theon and Jeyne 's time in Stannis ' camp from Theon 's viewpoint.I 'm glad that certain other plots ended where they did as the ending clearly segued into the next segment . They are1 . Jon 's possible death . I think it likely Melisandre will heal him as the red priests clearly possess this power but it 's a good natural finish.2 . Arya 's completion of training at the Temple of Black and White . Her tutelage with her first mentor is a good beginning for her story in the next book.3 . Davos ' setting off for Skagos . This storyline will begin and hopefully end in TWOW.4 . Tyrion 's solicitation of the Second Sons . We do n't know his plans but it 's a good finish to his time in Meereen.5 . Quentyn 's death . Seems apt.6 . Lady Nym setting off for King 's Landing.7 . Daenerys ' rescuecapture by Khal Jhoqo and Mago.I 'm also glad Martin left certain stories out entirely . They will make for interesting plots in the next book . They are1 . Sansa 's engagement to Harry the Heir.2 . Brienne and Lady Stoneheart 's plans.3 . Loras Tyrell . ",3
"I 'm beginning this reviewalthough it is more accurately a letter of complaint before I 've finished the book . At this point I 'm 62 chapters in and 81 % done and I 'm sick to death of it . I 'm struggling to finish and I never not finish books . The only book I ever did n't finish in disgust was the first Wraethlu book and this is nearly as bad as that . I do n't ever remember waiting this long for a book and being so disappointed . Even the Deathly Hallows did n't disappoint me as much as this and thatif you 'll remember my horror at that bookis saying something.I have now finished and while the book took a minor turn for the better it soon plummeted back into disappointing.The main problem to me is that it 's bloated beyond control . I ca n't blame the editors for this because I understand they had very little time to manage a monster of a book and it had already been cut down by about a third apparently but there 's so much padding it suffocates under its own weight like Lord Manderley falling asleep on his wife or something.Plus I would suspect that the editors worked on an arc or a pov and did n't see the book as a wholebut even if that was the case there 's no excuse for the repetition and rehashing Facts are repeated within the same POV we are told a dozen maybe two dozen times how Tyrion killed his father and Shae as if we 'd forgotten not only since reading the book where that happened but since reading Tyrion 's previous chapter . We are reminded over and over and over and in fact over who is leal to Winterfell and who has turned their cloak and who are enemiesso many times that I just wanted to scream . Even Asha who in previous books knows nothing of the grasssoft lords and their history suddenly seems an expert and we are reminded YET AGAIN what the position is regarding the Karstarks.Every time we see Davos and as much as I like Davos as a character I was glad we did n't see him more than we did or I would have given up reading altogether we are reminded over and over and indeed over and over again that he had seven sons and he 's lost four and about his fingers.and every single thing else we 've ever learned about this insignificant character . It 's not as if this fact is pigging relevant . Then when we are invested with all this time with Davos he 's dropped and we do n't see where he goes who he 's with blah de blah de blah . He 's a deus ex machina simply there to show plot points as they move on.So many chapters are not only rehashing as you know Bob narration and dialogue but are entirely unnecessary . It seems that GRRM thought well x person has got to get to x place so I 'd better show the journey . And the actual journeys are pointless.Seriously . Tyrion 's entire story of hundreds of pages could have started Tyrion woke up and found he did n't like being a slave . Yesthere was one vital character he met on his travels but his interaction with him was inconsequential and we did need the whole journey and the turtles . Ditto for Quentyn 's journey . Ditto for Victarian 's journey.This is a classic example of his padding in miniaturethe sky above Meereen was the colour of corpse flesh dull and white and heavy a mass of unbroken cloud from horizon to horizon . The sun was hidden behind a wall of cloud . it would set unseen as it had risen unseen that morning.You see what I mean . We 've had a literary description of the wall of cloud in teh sky then for people who do n't quite get it we get it 's cloudy Then for the complete thickos we are told what the consequence of this will be.I am not judging the book on this one section merely holding it up as a classic example of GRRM taking two or three ways to say the same thing . I have been tweeting over and over that nothing has happened yet and while that 's not entirely true it certainly felt like itprobably due to the overweighted and bloated chapters that are nothing more than description and travelogue and internal repetitious dialogue and angsting and telling us crap we already know and listing everyone in the scene and every merchant and every turtle and every type of food and every mercenaryI have learned that if you can take out a scene or a chapter entirely and it makes no difference at all to the plotthen that scene is entirely irrelevant and shouldmustbe excised . Now of course I do n't know GRRMS plan it might be that there 's a very good reason he left all the boring tripe in but it did n't help to make this the kind of book that the first 3 were.The problem with the chapters that are probably essential is everyone 's so bloody PASSIVE . There 's a reason Jon is so that did n't bother me but what the hell happened to Dany and Tyrion ? Did they both have lobotomies somewhere between books 4 and 5 ? Dany has gone down with a case of Tonksitis . Tonks from Harry Potter was a smart feisty auror that alone meant she was in the top 3percent of her classwho rocked in the fighting department.She was clever witty and amusing . Then in later books she fell in lurve lost her powers became nothing more than a weepy clinging woman and consequently died . Even when we see Ghost ! Remus later on she 's not with him . And Dany has gone the same way . She won a Horse Lord 's heart and his followers and thousands of poorfolk 's hearts then turns into nothing more than a girl in love led by men.Love does n't do well in this seriesas a matter of course . Of course I know that the good side does n't always win but sheesh sometimes they do . But there 's no character here who falls in love who gets a fair deal . In fact GRRM goes so far to list a whole heap of people who married for love and allthe appalling things that happened to them . that 's on top of the main characters who married for love and died horribly . CatNed Lysa DanyDrogo TyrionTysha and the others who loved without marriage and died horribly Add to that the sudden homophobia from all cornerswhen it had been much more accepted before . No love does n't do well.LISTs What was the point of all the lists ? Naming every hostage that came through the wall ? All the irritating hostages at irritating Meereen is there a point to Meereen ? All with too many Zs in their names.There were a paltry few chapters I liked . Perhaps ten out of 70 PLUS . But they do n't save this book which could have been cut in half and would n't have lost a thing.I will not be buying the next one . I 'll get it from the library . ",1
"EDIT Review revised based on helpful user feedbackI believe Dance With Dragons presents another strong entry into George Martin 's world . My enjoyment was heightened partially do to anticipation just to get my hands on another entry after waiting so long after the last book . If you are reading the series for the first time back to back then you may not share this same sense of 'giddiness'.After A Feast For Crows I relished the opportunity to get reacquainted with quite a few character 's POV chapters that were absent in the previous entry . It felt like getting to see an old friend again after spending some time away.I was happy with the progress Martin made in this entry and believe it sets up 'Winds Of Winter ' to begin the conclusion of the overall plot.I originally had this review as five stars but after reading some of the criticism from fellow users I have to agree on one point in particular . Martin far too often repeats words or phrases for certain characters to the point where it annoys and especially makes rereading difficult . At this point we do n't need to be reminded that Dany is a somewhat naive young girl or that Tyrion is upset with his father repeating 'Where do whores go ' a ridiculous amount . Martin seems to forget sometimes that we have already read 4000 pages of this saga before ever picking up book five.Otherwise I enjoyed the book very much and look forward to picking up the next entry two years from now . Thanks to all the users who left feedback to my original review as well . ",3
"George R. R. Martin is considered by many to be the Tolkien of the modern day . If you do n't know what that means please go read Lord of the Rings like everyone else on earth you 're probably the only one that has n't . Martin is well known for being able to craft extremely realistic worlds and characters and for not following generally any story archetypes preferring to come up with stories that might actually have happened in real life long long ago . He is also famous for ruthlessly killing off main characters in rather pointless ways to illustrate that no one person is any more important than any other be he king or beggar . This adds a further sense of realism to his books because in real life even those important to the story of your life are not immune to death.Like many grand fantasy epics A Song of Ice and Fire began as a trilogy but A Dance with Dragons was book five in said numerically challenged trilogy and there is no end in sight . Whilst writing book four Martin realized that the story he had outlined for that book was far too long to fit in a single volume . And so he decided that he could either write half of the story for all of the characters or write the whole story for half of the characters . Eventually he decided on the latter taking most of the characters I did n't care for and bundling their stories all into one book . This made for a rather painful reading experience though it did bring me around to one or two characters that I previously had no love for.After a six year wait book five has finally been released the second half of the story that was to be part of book four . I can not tell you how long I have been waiting for this book to come out . All of my favorite characters in the series that were woefully absent from the last volume are back and none of the characters I disliked make an appearance at all . It was almost worth the wait.A Dance with Dragons takes up where book three left on in the lives of Davos Seaworth Jon Snow the various Greyjoys Daenerys Targaryen Stannis Baratheon Bran Stark and Tyrion Lannister . Some plotlines introduced by characters in book four continue on during this book . This book is not a what happens next in the series sort of thing it 's what is happening with the rest of the characters during the previous book.Jon Snow grapples with being Lord Commander of the Knight 's Watch and guarding the wall while King Stannis tries to undermine his authority and take what he needs from the Watch to continue his war for the rightful claim to the throne . Winter is coming and with it the Others and their undead servants the Whites . Food is scarce money is even scarcer civil war tears the seven kingdoms apart and none can hear his calls for aid . He is forced to take the Wilding people from beyond the wall to help man it against the Others . He lets the ancient enemies of the Knight 's Watch those who have fought against and killed many of his friends on the wall through to help man it against their common foe but his own men whisper that when the crisis is averted they will be surrounded by enemies in their own strongholds.Tyrion Lannister has many misadventures fleeing the Seven Kingdoms after murdering his father plotting to return and kill the rest of his family as well . He seeks to join with Daenerys as she gathers her forces to protect the city she 's taken as her own to learn how to rule before returning to the Seven Kingdoms to take the throne that is hers.King Stannis gathers the forces of the North to march on Winterfell to rescue the girl whom he believes to be the last surviving child of Eddard Stark from her marriage to Ramsy Bolton . Elsewhere the young prince grandson of the former king who was overthrown fifteen years ago reveals himself with an army to conquer the lands that should rightfully be his . He was reported dead as an infant during the rebellion that brought down the monarchy but through treachery managed to be hidden away in safety awaiting the chance to reclaim what was taken from his family.And north of the wall Bran Stark finally comes to the home of the fabled Children of the Forest and the Three Eyed Crow who has called to him since he lost the use of his legs.The good ? After the last book which had only one character I liked in it A Dance with Dragons had all of my other favorite characters and only my favorite characters . The world that George R. R. Martin has created for this series is extremely realistic and well thought out . His sparing use of magic as more of a superstitious sort of thing that only undesirables seek after is a refreshing change from fantasy books where magic is the solution to every problem . His grasp of politics and his extremely realistic characters make for a very believable civil war and illustrate enmities between characters perfectly . Every one of the characters is distinct with different personalities and goals . His female characters tend to think and act like real women rather than like how men think women act.The bad ? The cast of characters for these books is huge . There are literally hundreds of named characters each with his own history that Martin will give once and expect you to remember . To further confuse matters many characters also have the same name or are named after historical figures or places in his world . For example . There are two men named Pike a place named Pike and a Battle of Pike all of whom are referred to simply as Pike . You 're left to figure out on your own which one he means by the context and it is not always clear from the context which he 's talking about.There is a lot of rather harsh language including the F word and the S word as well as quite a few other offensive terms for genitalia and other such things . Practically every single one of the characters in this series says or thinks at least a few words of harsh language during the course of the story.There is a lot of sex and crude talk of sex . The actual sex scenes are typically not graphic but the language the characters use to speak of it usually is . HBO recently made a miniseries out of the first book in the series andsurprise surpriseit has more nudity in it than any other TV show or movie ever created outside of pornography . If these things offend you you might want to steer clear . However do n't get the idea that this entire series is about nothing but sex cursing and nudity . That 's really a very small part of the overall story . I would say read one of the books for yourself and be the judge of whether it 's too much for you or not.George R. R. Martin has a strange sort of rambling way of telling a story . The way he talks about things is kind of like listening to a senile old man telling stories of his life that do n't have much to do with anything . However if you 're not paying attention to pretty much everything during these ramblings you 'll miss something important for when he tightens the strings and pulls the story together at the end in a way that makes all of the rambling make sense . Some people I know have a big problem with that style of writing and have a hard time getting through things that they feel are unimportant only to find at the end that they were incredibly important.The ugly ? This book is yet another in a disturbing trend amongst fantasy series of late in that it does n't have a clear climactic ending . The first book I noticed this in was Crossroads of Twilight by Robert Jordan but other authors such as Patrick Rothfuss Terry Goodkind Orson Scott Card and now George R. R. Martin have begun to do this as well . The climax is arguably the most important element in the plot . Everything builds toward it until it all comes crashing down in an avalanche of awesomeness . It 's like the reward for finishing the book you get a clear victory or defeat something is resolved and it 's usually in a grand climactic fashion . Many authors of late who are writing series seem to believe that since their book is in the middle of the series it does n't need a climax to end with because it 's not the end of the story but this is very wrong . Each and every book needs a climactic ending and no a simple cliffhanger is not a climactic ending . It 's just a lazy way of covering up that your book did n't have a proper ending . I know that George R. R. Martin is capable of coming up with epic climaxes for his books . Game of Thrones ended with the splitting of the Seven Kingdoms and the Crowning of the King in the North . A Clash of Kings ended with the Battle of King 's Landing . A Storm of Swords ended with the Red Wedding and the Wilding assault on the wall . A Feast for Crows ended with Cersei 's plots falling apart and the last supporters of King Robb being wiped out . All of those were epic climaxes to epic books however A Dance with Dragons basically just ended mid story with vague cliffhangers for each and every one of the characters rather than a clear climactic throwdown . Writers need to stop doing things like this . It takes a great deal of enjoyment out of reading their books when the reader does n't get anything to reward them for reading it at the end . The reason people read books is for the ending and this one did n't have one.The length between books in this series is ridiculous . I think the shortest time between any of them was four years . This one took six years to get out and to make things worse there was another book between this one and the previous one about these characters so the total wait time for the things happening in this book was about ten years . George R. R. Martin seems like he is a perfectionist and wants everything to be absolutely perfect before publishing a book . It takes him an extremely long time to do that as it is but he also stops to write side projects and publish them . Between A Dance with Dragons and the previous volume in this series he published three other unrelated books . The message boards on his web site are full of basically nothing but people complaining about how incredibly slow he is at getting books in this series out.To recap yes this book does have its vices and it is not for everyone . Many people do not like Martin 's style of writing . It did n't have a clear climax at the ending and far too many cliffhangers . However one thing that should be mentioned again is that this is half of the story that was supposed to be in a single book . Therefore the climax of the previous book was likely intended to cover this book as well . Martin will likely return to form with the next book in the series granted that he does not split the next book into two as well . Despite the lack of a clear ending where something has happened this was still an extremely enjoyable book to read and finally getting to what happens next with all of the good characters was almost worth not having a clear ending for any of them.I 'm giving this book 4 out of 5 stars due to its lack of a climax and the use of quite graphic sexual slang and language as well as other bad language and the gratuitous number of sex scenes . Martin is a great writer with great ideas but he sure does have a filthy mind sometimes . ",3
"I ca n't wait until Martin finishes book six . So many questions left unanswered . So many plots and story twists . Well worth the read ! ! ! ",4
"First the obvious . Martin takes way too much time to write these books . By the time the next one comes I 've completely forgotten everything but the major plot points . It takes about half of the book to start remembering who is who and what is what . A Song of Ice and Fire is just too dark of a series to go back and reread the first four books to get back up to slow speed.Martin spends lots of time in this book making characters do precisely nothing . Yes it 's well written yes it does keep you mostly interested but by the end of the book you wonder why you read it . Nobody progressed much of anything with regards to the story.The worst part is that at least one really cool thing does happen finally . But then near the end of the book Martin pretty much takes it all back again signalling that it will have to rehappen sometime in a far future book . The one word I would use to describe this book is frustrating.ASoIaF is a must read but it 's also amazingly difficult to do so . ",2
"Love this whole series and am patiently sort of waiting for the next instalment . One of the best fantasyadventure series that i 've ever read . ",4
"I found the last book somewhat lacking direction or stream of consciousness . This was the hardest book to follow since it was tied to the fourth book but lacking sequence . ",2
"I absolutely love Game of Thrones . I love the rich characterization and madeup history . I love that Martin keeps surprising me . And he managed to do that yet again a few times in book 5 . I loved it ! That being said I feel like George is spreading himself a bit too thin . I managed to work my mind around book 4 and book 5 being parallel stories but the fact is there just might be too many characters to keep track of . Though the story is rich and varied the overall timeline of the story advances very little in this book . We visit our favourite characters very seldom making room for ever more new faces and their own baggage . And can we say cliffhangers ? I estimate about the last 10 chapters end in serious unresolved problems ! Perhaps this is just great strategy on George R. R. Martin 's part . After all I 'm joining my voice with the masses of anxious fans asking When ? Hurry up please Mr. Martin ! We ca n't wait for book 6 . ",3
"Read these books . You wo n't regret it . I started reading the book and yes they are a little confusing at first with all the characters but once you get into them . Wow ! Great books . I think the show is a good cliff notes of the books ",4
"When I first started this series the thing that most amazed me was the sweep of emotions that it evoked in me . From the highest highs to the lowest lows . And the intense focus on the StarkLannister conflict meant that whenever one side was happy the other was unhappyand with characters on both sides to love at least one of my favorite characters would be doing well at any given moment.Wellnot anymore . The 'expanding world ' of the Song of Ice and Fire series means that now with so many splintering factions EVERYONE I love can be miserable at once . And GRR Martin 's ability to keep me on my toes seesawing between emotional extremes has devolved into a sort of dysfunctional relationship . Somewhere around the halfway point of A DANCE WITH DRAGONS I just gave up . I realized that whatever I most anticipated in the series would be denied that whatever I most dreaded would come to pass and I stopped having fun.I feel like a dog that 's been kicked too many times . I 'm numb to it desensitized . A kick from GRRM is just the status quo and my only reaction is resigned acceptance.A DANCE WITH DRAGONS had maybe three moments that really made me happy or excited . While I ca n't count how many times I just sighed and thought Of course . Of course this terrible thing has happened.It 's still an amazing world . And a fantastically intricate plot . Stuffed with compelling characters . But what does any of that matter if I 've been trained not to care for those characters or root for them or hope for them ? ",2
"Never have I enjoyed a book or series of books as much as I have in reading the 'The Game of Thrones ' series . I have never read anything that draws one into the characters and makes you feel a part of the story as this series does . You come to love every character good or evil and you want to be a part of their lives . This is one adventure that everyone should experience . A Masterpiece of writing . ",4
"If you liked any of the past books then you will like this one as well . It just furthers the stories along . I was hoping for a little more progression on some of the storylines as Mr. Martin is getting older and I want to know what happens for certain characters . I do n't want to go into much detail as that would ruin some surprises . Bottom line unless you do n't like GOT which if you do n't why did you read the last four books ? Get this book . ",4
"The first three books in this series were fastpaced with lots of huge gamechanging events per book and that was part of the draw for me . A Feast for Crows and now A Dance With Dragons are n't like that they 're slower more contemplative more thematicallydriven rather than plotdriven . It 's certainly a change and I was initially a bit disappointed . But ultimately I really liked A Dance With Dragons and I ranked AFFC at 3.5.There is n't as much plot momentum here as in previous books and at times I found that frustrating although it helped to know about it going in . But I never found the book less than compelling the character development is solid the worldbuilding excellent the writing good and the thematics strong and enough happened to keep me interested . I enjoyed visiting new places on Martin 's map and the immersive descriptions it 's as if I actually visited many of these places something I value highly in any book . And I really enjoyed the look at the realities of leadership seeing the characters grow and change and gradually learning more about some of the backstory mysteries.It makes the most sense to discuss this book in terms of specific storylines so I 'll break it down no spoilers ! DAENERYS Unlike many readers I found her chapters to be among the most interesting in the book . Previously she 's done a lot of traveling and it was cool to see her actually ruling here . The conflict between her values and principles and the realities of her situation was fascinating . A lot of people have been frustrated with her relationship with Daario but despite his manifest unattractiveness I liked that too Dany 's at the age where this often happens and how many fantasy heroines are allowed to have a fling ? Also this storyline let Martin flesh out Meereen more than he 'd previously done with anyplace outside Westeros in previous books I found Dany 's eastern surroundings somewhat twodimensional but while the local characters still are n't as vivid as the Westerosi here he goes a long way toward closing that gap.JON Paralleling Dany 's storyline we see him trying to rule and the myriad difficulties he faces . Both he and Dany are faced with hard decisions and break new ground trying to do what they see as right which did n't fail to keep my interest . Ends on a ridiculous cliffhangerbut while I 've never liked Martin 's ending books this way he 's done it since the beginning and I 've gotten used to it.TYRION His arc resembles Arya 's in A Clash of Kings he spends the book journeying toward a specific destination Daenerys in his case and along the way he meets interesting people develops as a character and faces a lot of personal reversals and changes of fortune . without reaching his destination . I was a bit frustrated by this in both books it 's hard not to be . But there 's a lot there and it 's interesting to see Tyrion try to make it without being able to call on the Lannister name or the wealth of Casterly Rock every time things go sour.THEONREEK Martin likes to challenge your opinion of a character . I did n't like this arc as much as many others Ramsay is so twodimensionally sociopathic and evil that it was hard to summon up any feelings toward him and having hated Theon in previous books I wonder if being victimized has really improved him . The jury 's still out on that.ARYA BRAN DAVOS JAIME CERSEI Only get a couple chapters each although they 're interesting . This book is certainly sprawling there are so many characters in so many different places that it just is n't as unified as say A Game of Thrones.QUENTYN Has an interesting storyline and a complete arc . He himself is rather dull but he was intended to be . A thoughtful examination of the forces at work on somebody in his position.SELMY Meh kind of a less interesting copy of Eddard Stark . He 's more another pair of eyes on Meereen than an important character in his own right.ASHA Not many chapters but hardhitting and atmospheric . We get a taste of Westeros winter here and it 's a scary thing . Also Asha herself is awesome.VICTARION Also does n't reach his destination but there are some fascinating things going on in his chapters . I still hope somebody stabs him though.ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE Yes there are more . It 's a big book . The downside is that when a chapter ends we often have to go 100 pages or more before seeing that character again the upside that there 's a lot going on.Ultimately a lot of this book is setup and I 'm not thrilled with that when most of the best books of all time are significantly shorter than this does Martin really need nearly 1000 pages for setups and transition ? It 's easy for fantasy series to become selfindulgent and here a couple arcs seem to have their climaxes deferred others simply do n't go where I thought they would and that 's fine.It 's not a perfect book aside from thatthere are some important secondary characters who are n't very vividly drawn especially true in Dany 's chapters but then there are great bitpart characters of the sort I 've come to expect from Martin . I have some reservations about his treatment of gender issuesfor the most part he does all right and at least he 's thinking about it but at times he falls flat because he 's just so entrenched in the male gaze.Despite all that I enjoyed the two weeks or so I spent with this book . It 's a wellwritten intelligent novel and enough twists and turns are thrown at the reader to keep me satisfied . None of the characters are the same as they were at the beginning of this book nor are their storylines . A solid four stars . ",3
"You can tell that the end is near and the loose ends are about to be tied . So many questions are left to be answered and this is why George RR Martin is a genius ! One of the best epilogues I 've ever read . I ca n't wait for Book 6 ! ",4
"I am sincerely hoping that Mr. Martin continues writing this series . I love how he keeps changing characters in the books and killing people you do n't expect . Great twists in the writing . ",4
"It is not my practice to post reviews when my Kindle says I have read only 48 % of the book in question . I am making an exception hoping that things are going to improve . Right now I am not hoping I am prayingto the old gods to R'hllor anyonethat GRRM has become a factory operation like Thomas Kinkade Painter of Light and that he has a horde of apprentices racketing away at their keyboards occasionally pausing so that He Himself can insert telling phrases like Words are wind to lend authenticity to the product . At this stage of the narrative I know a jape we have Tyrion penned up on The Stinky Steward with Penny I used to know an irritating one I dubbed Small Change and I pass that along and a sow named Pretty Pig . Now that 's harsh even for crossbowing your evil father in the gut . I think . And it 's not as though we have n't witnessed Tyrion 's remorse for the deed again and again and again Right now this is n't A Dance With Dragons it 's a Plod With a Pig . And achingly unreadable . Thanked be fortune it hath ben otherwise Asha dead or alive got a worldclass shag out of young what'shisname before the northmen arrived I applaud the chapter which made Melisandre actually pretty sympathetic which I did not previously believe to be possible still ca n't quite get the interplay of Mance Rayder and Rattleshirt but hell details and as long as I can quit thinking This is just like American Graffiti with all the feckless adolescents cruising after the semimystical Blonde in the White Convertible things are going along . Sort of . Except for this wish I have that someone Daario is my candidate would tie Dany up and tell the Unsullied to let those dragons loose after allowing sufficient time for prediction and handicapping on a citywide basis.I am going to finish this book somehow . My prediction is that there 's no way all of these stories are going to wrap in only two more volumes . Keep those apprentices typing and call Pizza Hut . ",2
"My issue with this book is that it 's been years since the last one was released . And since this book is actually picking up from where Book 3 left off it 's been even longer since that one . A synopsis of what had happened in the previous books would have been helpful . As it was since I did n't reread the other ones prior to this one I could n't even remember who some of the characters were or what had happened to them . Too many names . I should n't have to resort to Wikipedia or Google to try and remember who someone is . I also would have appreciated an alphabetical index of characters at the back instead of the way he formatted it . I ca n't even count the number of times I flipped to those lists of names at the back and would search it hoping to see the name I was trying to identify.All that being said I found the book a little slow at times . But the detail and the imagery is astounding . The world he has created is vast and I was constantly amazed at how he puts so much into his words . ",2
"I liked reading it . I like the characters the world they live in the different cultures . I like GMMR 's style and writing . I was curious about how the story would progress . The short version of the premises Seven kingdoms vie for the throne as the long season of Winter approaches and with it an old threat from the north.The book puts a spotlight on a too large cast of characters while none of the contenders for the throne get anywhere . We literally learn nothing about the threat from the north . It is well crafted at the same time to this reader does not meet its purpose well . ",2
"This morning I finished the last page of A Dance With Dragons and am left with an empty hole to fill . There a few writers that can spin this kind of epic fantasy stories without falling into cliche . My previous favorites like Raymond Feist and David Eddings are great and easy readings but they do n't influence me like A Song of Ice and Fire or Lord of the Rings . A Dance With Dragons like it 's predecessors is not to be taken lightly . One does not simply read these books Martin takes a wondrous children tale shakes out the wizards and the blackandwhite moral that forms the foundation of fantasy since Tolkien and describes a bleak cold world filled with people in all shades of grey . The greyness only adds to the depth of the characters . Like reality this is not a simple story of good vs evil . Rape is common as is torture and decease is rife . You better not be lowborn in Westeros or you can look forward to fight for your life virtue andor possessions almost every day . The real dark ages were n't any different though so you ca n't blame Martin for depicting a realistic setting.It is the constantly changing storyline that makes the books so attractive . Nothing and nobody is spared failure . Ned Stark one of the main characters in a game of Thrones has been killed which started a war that soon took precedent over the supernatural threat from the North . Even after five books the white walkers remain mysterious . Daenerys Targaryen is losing control of her dragons and finds out that there is more to being a dragon queen then just sit on a throne and rule . Jon is having trouble on the wall . Tyrion is as cunning as ever but finds himself in dire straits after being accused of killing his nephew and actually killing his father . He remains himself though and always knows how to make the best of a situation . Even Cersei finds that despite cunningly building her powerbase for thousands of pages it just takes a paragraph to change it . Nothing is sacred and as a reader you better not get too attached to any character in the book.If you 're looking for a fairytale with elves and bearded dwarves and a magical ending look elsewhere . If you like your dwarves without a nose and a grim story where courageous people fight and sometimes die with endless intrigue and power struggles and twists and turns where you least expect it invest some time and read this book . Be prepared to wait a few years for the next volume though as this one took 6 years ! ",4
"SPOILER ALERT George r.r . martin is a putz . Any author that kills off the main character at the END of a book should neverbe published again . PERIOD . Note it 's been 3 years since he wrote it with no resolution . I will never read anotherGeorge rr f.ing Martin book again . ",0
"While reading the first 4 books in A Song of Ice and Fire Series I just could n't put them down . But while reading a Dance With Dragons I have to make myself read in order to finish the book.The book has too many pointless descriptions of places clothes and food . There are also too many pointless dialogues and things who could have been told in one chapter takes 3 or 4 . Besides that something rarely happens . ",0
"Totally great writing and multiple story lines . I will be sad when the last book is written you must read them all ",4
"This book had way too many characters that I could care less about . I am talking about CHAPTER after CHAPTER of utterly useless and boring information on boring characters . Nothing happens until the end of the book . This book DOES NOT MOVE much at all . I was seriously disappointed and skipped entire chapters just to find tidbits of interesting chapters towards the end.No I did not buy it . Otherwise I would be even more pissed . ",2
"Book five just like book four more characters take charge more die more are in other states . Not that it is n't good or that it is bad it just is . You rout for one then get broken hearted and curse as your hero just bit the bullet . It 's an interesting way of writing reel you in then behead them . Will I read the next one ? Yes but only because I want to see the twisted end ",3
"I loved this book and the whole series . I am so sad that I am done now and that I 'll have to wait for who knows how long until I get to continue the saga . I 've got to say Mr Martin could do a little less sexual assault because frankly that is not entertaining to me . However he does weave an intricate web of a plot among all these characters . This book makes book four make so much more sense but I still do n't like the Arya plotline . ",4
"Well it had to be read because of the unfinished stories leading up to this book . BUT oh my goodness how disappointing . The stories led nowhere . All the main characters die . ",2
"Before everyone gets their nickers in a twist I want to start this review off by saying that I am a huge fan of the series . I started reading the series back in college and fell in love with the story the world and the characters well before there was even a smidgen of a thought that this would be turned into a HBO series . Or any series other than a book series for that matter . Martin 's exceptional style and captivating writing has entranced the world including myself . Fantasy lovers get their fix and nonfantasy lovers find themselves enthralled against their earlier judgment.A Dance with Dragons is the fifth book in what should be a seven part series if Martin does n't retire or kick the bucket anytime soon . The previous book A Storm of Swords was lackluster at best with many of our characters having been removed from the story for a time . We were excited anticipatory and downright anxious for Dance to come out so that we might get our fix of some of our favorite characters . And when we finally did we got 1000 pages of filler . Note the use of the term good in the title of this review because I actually mean it . Despite the fact that the book was n't what I wanted it to be it was still good . Martin is too powerful of a writer to have more than one star taken from him for the somewhat lackluster book . Besides like its companion novel A Storm of Swords it is clearly setting up . The problem is Martin more than likely could have set up by combining Storm and Dance together into one 1000 page novel instead of two . C'est la vie.In his defense his 2000 pages of filler between Storm and Dance gives us a fuller more realistic view of the characters the world and the history involved in shaping the world . In fact this novel tends towards a more historical perspective swooping in with tales of Dorne Valyria the Free Cities and the slaveryled ones . What 's more is that Martin gives us a few new characters and a few new plots and a few new holy crap that 's going to change everything moments . That alone helps the story along and keeps his starrating towards the right hand side of the screen and not the left.Martin still has us transfixed and despite the long journey we are hooked . My only regret is having to wait x number of years before Winds of Winter even thinks about hitting the printing presses . ",3
"Well done . More appealing and catching than book 4 . The story is more involving and moving forward in a better . ",4
"I gave it 5 stars because I was tired of rating items that I have not even received yet.You really need to keep up with your quality control a little better . I mean.you are the ones that send out the delivery date ",4
"Glancing at the ratings for his 5 books in the series one would think these are just good books . They are masterpieces . 13 & 5 were slamdunk 5 star books . They were every bit as good as the Asimov Foundation and Robot Series better than Frank Herbert 's Dune masterpieces in fact some of the best scififantasy I have ever read . Note I did not mention Tolkien 's Lord of the Rings . As it was my intro into science fiction after Andre Norton 's great Daybreak 2250 it will hold a special place and no flaw other than the running after Saruman 's orcs for chapters will be heard by me . I also left volume 4 for last . I am probably the wrong person to ask . Basically most of the characters in that book were ones I did not like much the villains more or less . Since my favorite characters had little roles I rated it was a 4 . Book # 5 started BOOM and was a 5 star all the way through.because it returned to the complete story slowly advanced the story significantly explained moves by each of the players of GOT brought back a couple players thought removed and left us hanging with the mother of all cliffhangers . Get it get it quick keep it safe..shu ",4
"let me just say this book was almost a complete waste of time and if the 6th book does n't tidy up the story line I will not be reading anymore of his books ",1
"If you 're looking for complex development across a large array of characters or amazing descriptions of settings this is your book ! If you 're seeking plot advancement this book is like watching grass growon Quaaludes . It seems to me that Martin started off this series strong but lost control over his storyline over the past two installments . Things have gotten a little too complex to move the story forward smoothly . And given the pace at which Martin writes it 's a gamble as to whether or not I 'll live long enough to see him finish this series off I 'm 55 really just jabbing here at the years between book releases . I hope Martin regains the magic in the next book.2 starszzzzzzzzzzzzz . ",1
"Read all five books from Game of Thrones and excited to read book six which we hear might be out soon ? Hopefully ? The writer keeps you on the edge of your seat has chapters dedicated to each player in the game . Is educational exciting and captivating . Love it ! ! ",4
"Wish he would finish the series already too much going on and the next book needs to conclude this mess . ",2
"Great book ! Not quite as good as book 3 but still a great read ! Ca n't wait for the next one ! ",3
"Ok I read it . I discovered these books only this year after the HBO series premiered . I devoured the first two in days and have read all of the many many thousands of pages since spring . But really even for me unintimidated by length and lover of complexity this has to stop . Someone needed to tell Mr. Martin 3 or 4 books ago that editing can be a gift to the writer . I did not buy this volume having decided that I 've spent enough on the series with no end in sight . Libraries a gift to the exasperated . Still well written still full of dark complexity but I really want him to get to the end . I find the characters interesting less so with repetition and I find the politics interesting less so with repetition and I find the world dark and compelling less so with repetition . Oh have I mentioned the repetition ? One other flaw with the exception of Tyrion Lannister and a short time in Book 1 in the Stark family castle this is the most relentlessly dark and unhappy group of people ever to grace literature . There is always excepting Tyrion ZERO humor . A dose of Prozac before embarking on a tour of Westeros would be a wise move . Nevertheless I will certainly read though not buy the finale if there is a finale.Talent and vision are best yoked to discipline and Martin 's lack of discipline in editing himself has made the series suffer . I started this in the spring and now Winter is indeed coming and I have almost lost my patience . ",3
"This is essentially the second half of Book 4 . There are some great reviews of it so I wo n't go into great detail . Some people love it some hate it . You have to understand what 's going on with the series . The land is recovering from a devastating war . The characters have all scattered to survive and are rebuilding their lives . These two books update the activities of the main characters in their new situations . I have faith that Book 6 will bring everyone back together and their saga will continue in a more organized manner . Book 3 is still the best of the series . ",4
"Several years ago I read A Game of thrones . I simply loved it . Martin created a world that was alive and more real than our own because unlike most books of the genre both the narrative and characterization were realistic even if the setting was a world where each season lasted several decades.A Dance with Dragons in comparison but also on its own is a pretty bad book a promise unfulfilled . In a thousand pages the characters of this book travel thousands of miles they depart from nowhere and they arrive nowhere too . I do n't want to spoil anything but one new character seemed to be created only because Martin is running out of characters to kill and he still has apparently two books to go.He created a Red Shirt.This was a great series but the last two books were a disaster worse they were boring . It pains me a lot buy I only gave it one star because that is the lowest rating available . ",0
"Is he going to leave this way.. When 's the next book ? He ca n't die ! He must go on writing ! Do n't stop ! ",4
"This book does an excellent job of continuing with the characters and introducing new ones moves a little slow in some areas but overall I find it as exciting and entertaining as the first four books ! ",3
"The Game of Thrones series is a delight . These books are long but fascinating every step of the way . Mutliple characters great story telling . Hop on board . ",4
"I read the first book of this extravaganza with my book club and have n't quit ! Not much of a fantasy reader in general but these books have really grabbed my attention and I will be waiting for Six and Seven to wrap up the many loose endscharacters ! I especially appreciate how the author has continued to surprise me with the many plot twists and turns and how my feelings about specific characters have changed from Book One to Book Five I 'm now rooting for people I dispised . As all of these books are such tomes it is something of a relief to take a break and read something else work in my gardens etc . ",3
"For a 5 book series with a huge cast of characters the author seems as though he just gave up tying it all together . If the purpose was to suck me into a 6th book forget it ! But it seemed like he just got tired . Adios George I wo n't be seeing you in your next realm . ",0
"I love this series this epic tale this world and all its characterseven the ones we love to hatebut I agree with several other reviewers that Book Five got a whole lot o & # 8217 nothing done in a whole pile o & # 8217 pages . It was a very interesting pile o & # 8217 nothing but it did bog down in spots . I even took a break in the middle to read a free indie book . We really did go nowhere but we had a helluva time doing it . I will patiently await the next book and will most faithfully watch the series . Thank you Mr. Martin for the tale both in book and television form . ",3
"This book had all the greatness you would expect from the Ice and Fire series . Ca n't wait for the next one to come out ! ",4
"What can I say ? All the George R R Martin books are terrific and this is why they were made into the TV epic Game of Thrones . ",4
"A fantastic story with twists turns and many changeups . The Author had many heros and just as many if not more villians doing all kinds of mean and nasty things to the characters.I could n't wait to pick up the next book ! ",4
"This series was recommended to me by my 15 year old grandson . I am enjoying it immensely and hope the author completes the next book before I forget the characters and their relationships forget where we are in the unusual number of storylines and before my grandson ages into his 20 's . ",4
"Martin continues the saga at the same level of excellence . Love some characters hate others . Hope book 6 is out soon ! ",4
"I found it difficult to finish this book because I did n't care about most of the characters . I enjoyed the Arya and Jon segments but the others rarely held my interest . I have fond memories of reading the earlier books but that thrill was largely absent here . ",1
"This is more than I can or could have asked for oil terribly.thankful for his work of words surpassing much and more . ",4
"Martin continues his tradition of dragging out plotlines to the point where you want to skip whole chapters to find something significant happening . His writing skills are excellent but I 've finally realized I do n't care for his storytelling . With so many pointofview characters it 's no wonder that his books crawl . I have come to believe that he keeps adding characters simply because he runs out of people to kill.I was so disappointed in the ending after taking so much effort to finish the book that is the last of his novels I will read . I am clearing the others out of my library.Read at your own risk and do n't expect much in the way of a conclusion . Then again that 's the way all of Martin 's books are so I 'm sure you know this already . ",0
"11 yrs with no Jon Tyrion Daenerys or even Stannis and after 900 hundred pages NOTHING HAPPENS ! This book keeps working towards a good ending and then stops right before it . And the funny thing is the book did not have to be 900 pages . All three of the main characters had chapters where nothing happened GRRM could have removed around 200 pages by cutting some of the extra fat.Thank god for the HBO miniseries seasons 2 and 3 should ROCK ! ! ! SpoilerGRRM IF YOU KILL OFF JON SNOW I WILL BURN YOUR BOOK AND NEVER BUY OR READ ANOTHER BOOK BY YOU AGAIN ! ",2
"anything that has to do with game of thrones I love this is a great book and story is to cant wait for next installment ! a+ thanks ",4
"A good story but I long for a satisfying end . Almost all the characters I like are dead or trivialized . Do n't know if it is worth slogging through another volume . ",3
"While I can understand some of the negative reviews I thought the novel was a worthy addition in the series . It moved the story along enough to set up the final two novels . ",3
"Books 13 were engrossing and broke so many accepted standards for fiction in a good way . Book 4 was acceptable but overly long for the actual plots progression . Book 5 barely moves any plot forward and makes me wonder if GRRM has totally given up on the series as a whole . It seems more like he is simply writing to fulfill some publisher 's obligation . Mark Twain once wrote a long letter and apologized that he did n't have time to write a short letter . That 's how this book feels GRRM did n't have time to write a a good sequel and ended up just rambling all over the place including every thought he ever had about the story line . And to think I waited five years for this ! I feel totally betrayed by the author . ",0
"I waited too long to buy fook five . I enjoyed the entire book and it fit well with the series . I know some people complain when their favorite character is not given amount of attention they would prefer but I find the book continues to develop the characters addressed in an interesting fashion . ",3
"Great book . Gets back to the usual characters after the departure from boo 4 . Typical GRRM twists and turns Love the entire series . ",4
"Addicted to this saga . Is there anything else as exciting creative and fresh ? Boy there are so many twists and turns ! Now I must go withdrawal after reading the first give in 6 months ! ",4
"I enjoyed these books . I am a fan of them . The richness of character and the diversity of Mr. Martin 's world are aspects I greatly enjoyed . When I say diversity I mean in fleshed out religious plurality ethnic racial etc . It mirrors much of for myself what I love about our own world . However I must say Mr. Martin 's lens of reality is very nihilistic . That within each of these aspects of diversity and even within the particular lives of the charactersMeaning is punished . Most of all the reflections of the diversity are either the bad rape murder blood lust or tragictragic in the sense that honor fidelity love etc . are seen as anachronistic in some parts . For the most part though the best of our Human traditions are shown to be foolish and punished terriblyany form of belief is shown by the 'fates ' in this world to be worthless practiced by fools honorable fools but fools nonetheless.I would recommend this series for anyone that is stronger in or has experienced the opposite of the truth that Mr. Martin is portraying . For these particular people I think it can be a dark but fun jaunt through a bitter world we are glad is not totally reflected in our own . Yes all of the horror occurs here but despite it seemingly endless and continuous we see love fidelity and honor arise . Not in the abundance of its other and yet as I have seen it if not in equal quantity it is its match in strength.Fun read.for particular people ",3
"Ca n't put it down . Book 4 was tough to get thru and now I am soaring on a dragon . A must ! ",4
"Have you ever gone to a movie of an established franchise and felt like the movie you were sitting through was just one long shameless trailer for the next movie ? This is n't quite the biter taste in my mouth that I had with Feast but its not a pleasant sensation either . How can a book that is nearly 1000 pages feel like it 300 pages to short ? The story is good when it centers on the northDevros Bran Reek and John and the IronbornMiddle of the road is probably Tyrion who does n't do much except travel from one place to another and never quite arrives at the place he needs to be . I also have to give credit where I can in the three Cersei chapters we are presented with she manages to come across as less intense and insane then she did in Feast.There were also several more POVs that were captivating its two bad we only had 2 max of each of them.Downright frustrating is Daenerys who regresses quite a bit in this book and it is just as confusing that in the end Martin simply pushes the reset button . I guess dealing with the knot bynot dealing with it yet is one way to manage it.OverallMartin writes really well and that is almost enough to mask the fact that nothing of many major substance is accomplished in this installment . If anyone has read the Dark Tower by Stephen King you should be familiar with the feeling . The first books were full of much promise but considering what this series has evolved into I ca n't recommend getting emotionally invested . ",2
"Gripping story . Sad to say goodbye to dear friends . Ca n't wait for the next chapter.Bring it on asap please.Thanks . ",4
"I have to preface by saying I loved book 1 but have been increasingly disappointed with subsequent novels . OK maybe book 3 was reasonable . It is sad to see a series where each book is about half as good as the one before it . Martin needs an editor with an iron fist . This book makes watching grass grow exciting . Really why take every character that you have built over many books and either degrade them make them unpleasant and unlikable or just slit their throat . And while you are at it throw in some brand new characters who meander around contributing nothing to the overarching storyline.I so enjoyed the first book . I survived the death of so many main characters in the next few books . But now I just ca n't be bothered anymore . The whole series should have stayed a trilogy . I ca n't make the effort to wade through chapters of nothing to get the odd tidbit of plot progression.Can someone tell me after they finish the series if anyone worth caring for survives ? Do the dragons come and melt the icy bad guys ? Does Tyrion get to be King ? Do I really care ? ",0
"I 'm a big fan of good guys getting the beautiful girl and really bad guys getting their just deserts . George Martin comes through on both counts once again . Of course I took that on line quiz thing on facebook and found that I 'm Ned Stark and fans of the series know that Ned got the big haircut in the first book . I 'm hoping the 6th book will come out real soon ! ",4
"Maybe it 's because I came late to the George RR Martin opus and did n't have to wait years for the fifth novel but I am amazed that so many fans seem to hate this book . I LOVED it . And I think the fans who write four and five page rants are just disappointed that it did n't turn out as they imagined . If you want a different book go write your own ! ",4
"Fantastic ingenious Great Read a sure page turner . A pure entertainment at nonstop intervals . Could not stop reading it.Highly Recommended.Author George Wilder Jr.Nobody Knows ",3
"Keeps me guessing but do not always like who dies . In some ways the writing is too dark for me but I find it hard to put the book down . Very interesting characters and I like the strong women . ",3
"Last book I wo n't be a spoiler . The story continues this is a complex multi threaded tale . Great charactersgood plots Audio version great voices though alittle confusing at first to American ears . ",3
"Well Kindle + Game of Thrones = awesome.The book is amazing and kindle also . Online delivery for the book worked as it was expected interesting story . ",4
"This was my second reading of A Dance with Dragons and I loved it and hated it as much as the first . Such rich and varied characters and settingsit 's hard to remember that this is fiction . The way Martin makes you love and root for a character and then deals them tragedy even death is just stunning . On goodreads someone dubbed him George Really Ruthless Martin and I have to agree . The worst part is how long we 'll have to wait for the next installment . I may have to start all over with Game of Thrones . ",4
"I waited how long for A Dance With Dragons ? It is not poorly written and there are some very good moments in the novel but it is ultimately filler . Perhaps these pages will be meaningful come book six but from where we as readers came A Dance With Dragons is tough to appreciate . ",2
"George Martin is an exceptional storyteller who is incredibly detailed in describing all of the characters in the Game of Thrones . The ongoing and intertwining plots and subplots keeps the reader coming back for more ",4
"I found this to be the weakest of the series so far . Martin 's writing is as spellbinding as ever but when you look back not much happened in the story . I will say the last third of the book picked up quite a bit but for a book this size you want a little more progression . I found the epilogue to be especially teasing . Volumes 4 and 5 seem to be great illustrations of Martin 's facility with words but both lacked the energy of the first three books . Still when the writing is this good I will be among the audience . ",3
"The story line is easy to follow . The characters have depth and can make you create feelings towards your favorites.NOW HURRY UP AND WRITE THE NEXT ONE . ",4
"The initial story line appeared to be sound and could possibly be interesting . But the author 's treatment of the characters and twisted scenarios left me cold and disgusted . I never actually got to book five having given up and abandoned the story on book two . There are good sword and sorcery tales out there but this is not one as far as I am concerned . ",0
"Reality can be harsh to happy endings . Evil is not always defeated the hero does not always get the girl and nobody ever really lives happily ever after . That 's fantasy.Take for example the tale of a plucky fantasy author battling to finish his life 's work who overcomes a sixyearlong bout of writer 's block to at last complete the fifth installment in his epic . It would be nice to think that the book thus produced was worth the wait . That would be the happy ending . But reality can be harsh to happy endings . A Dance with Dragons is not the book I waited six years to read and to wish otherwise would be fantasy.George R. R. Martin 's A Song of Ice and Fire series was never mere fantasy but with each new volume it is becoming more and more a daytime soap opera.Mr Martin famously spent the second half of the 80s working in television and if I may jump to unwarranted conclusions this experience seems to have helped him break new ground by infusing fantasy with some of the best aspects of TVsharplydrawn sympathetic characters crisp witty dialogue and intricate plotting.He 's also made clever use of catchphrases and personal mottoes to provide a kind of leitmotif to each character 's story and give a sense of continuity and cohesion to the tale A Lannister always pays his debts If I look back I am lost You know nothing Jon Snow . More famously he 's gotten good mileage from his willingness to kill off seemingly key characters at surprising moments.Maintaining such a high standard of writing for even one book would have been an impressive feat . Mr Martin managed it for three stumbled on the fourth and after 20odd years working on the series the fatigue is beginning to show.The personal catchphrases continue to get good airtime with a Lannister always pays his debts featuring five times If I look back I am lost or doomed six times and You know nothing Jon Snow an impressive 13 . However much of the other writing has become simply repetitive and lazy . The phrase words are wind also pops up 13 times in various character 's mouths much and more meaning a lot gets used as hefty 30 times but this is pipped for the number one spot by she was not wrong at a teethgritting 33 times . These phrases have become less a leitmotif more a pianist banging the same three chords over and over again.As part of the series ' gritty image Mr Martin has never been shy about including sex in his stories but now he appears to be shoehorning it in simply for its own sake . One character spends the night before a siege having graphic sex . Another pays a surprise visit to one of his generalsand interrupts the latter midcoitus . A description of a man being burned at the stake takes time out to tell us what happens when the fire reaches his genitals.The habit of killing off characters has likewise devolved into selfparody . Having already killed off most of the expendables Mr Martin spends most of A Dance with Dragons only appearing to kill off characters but not really . One is apparently executed but is n't . Another appears to drown but does n't . Yet another seems to be beheaded butwell you get the idea . The effect is a bit like the boy who cried wolf and cheapens the book 's finale in which two key characters appear to die since by then the reader does n't believe for minute Mr Martin will actually follow through.The other major drawback to the wholesale slaughter among named characters is that Mr Martin spends much time introducing a slate of new characters in much the same way that the old Star Trek series used to introduce new redshirts.What is left ? Plot but not much of it . Most of the characters spend their time somnolently staggering from A to B . There are sporadic bouts of frenetic action to be sure but the story itself continues to plod along fairly aimlessly as far as I can see . With no resolution to any of the major plot lines anywhere in sight it 's increasingly hard to care about any of the latest crop of characters knowing they probably wo n't live much longer than halfway through the next book when and if it is ever published . It 's only in the handful of chapters that Dance with Dragons shakes off its lethargy and wraps up in a number of cliffhanger endings.I would like to believe the series will get better that all questions will be answered all the plot lines will come together but if there 's one thing Mr Martin has taught me it 's not to believe in happy endings . ",1
"I know a LOT of people are professing their disappointment in A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons stating that the books are nothing more than stalling and the characters are n't truly going anywhere . But I have to state for the record that George R.R . Martin 's worst book is still better than some of the best books I 've read by many other authors who try to imitate him.The characters continue to grow and mature and I think that was more important than jumping on to the next big issue in the book . It 's called development and in a novel it takes a chapter or two eventually leading the novel to a much bigger and better conclusion . Unfortunately some people want instant gratification and that is n't something you 're going to get from this book . What you will get is more background history and development of characters . You 'll start to feel empathy for some of the characters you hate and frustration with some of the characters you love . They make decisions and go places we did n't forsee in the earlier books . And with an epic series of this kind it sometimes takes an entire novel to build the story up rather than a few chapters in a novel.I for one was extremely satisfied at the end of A Dance with Dragons . It left me aching for more and frustrated that I have to wait for the next installment . I hope this series continues to develop and grow and does n't come to a cataclysmic end . We 've spent so many books anticipating the coming of winter that I want to live through the winter and see the spring with these characters I 've come to know ! I highly recommend this bookseries to anyone who enjoys fantasy and historical novels . From teen to adult I think anyone would enjoy them.Happy Reading = ",3
"My husband read these and loved them . I picked up the first one and read a chapter or two and set it down . Now that I have a Kindle it is hard to read 'real ' books . It is n't really my genre anyway . Then the series came out on TV and I was hooked and read them all . I will say had struggled a bit with all of the people to keep track of and I 'm not certain his transitions are as good as they could be . My suggestion to him would be that if you have that many character and story lines that adding some clues would help along with better transitions . I suspect that the editor has his hands tied and is n't allowed the full capacity of his job.So it is hard to say whether I just did n't want to read the book the first time or the author did n't visualize them enough for me so keep that in mind while deciding to consider my rating . There were moments when I passed the series and had to go back a bit or rework things . If I had one thing to say to George RR Martin is do n't change your mind . If it happened in the book and you second guess yourself and wish you 'd done something else let it go and stick with the book . Makes it a bit confusing . ",4
"Oh George ! I read all five of your books in a row and I am hooked but oh so mad ! You left me hanging regarding some of my favorite characters AGAIN ! I admit I was not as happy with book four and all the new characters featured . I do n't want to care about the fate of any new characters . I have my quota with the original characters . Thank heavens you got back to them in book five . Hooray ! Seriously book five advanced the action for Daenerys the Starks and the Lannisters in dramatic and at times shocking ways . George your extraordinary creativity in crafting unusual environments and interactions while keeping the characters very recognizably human shines in Dragons . The surprise to me at the turns of events in the latter parts of the book has me completely puzzled as to where you will take the multile plots . When does book six come out ? ",4
"Liked the book loved the series . The last book seemed to be a little too long but that 's just my opinion . Not long as in too many pages but long as in drug out . ",3
"Not as quick a read as the previous books.You absolutely would be lost if you had not read the first four books . I am enjoying it but that is mostly because it continues the story ",2
"This story line could have been wrapped up a lot quicker than it has been . I 'm actually starting to find it tedious to read it . ",2
"I am getting a little impatient with this series . I want to like it but really must every likeable character get the shaft ? And I feel that the plot has run away with itself . ",1
"It has been so long since the last book of the series it 's hard to remember some of the details he is talking about . But so far the story is living up to the rest of the series . I am about 13 of the way through the book now and ca n't wait to pick it up again . I take it everywhere with me so if I have even 5 minutes I can see what 's happening next ! ",3
"Books 1 2 3works of genius . Amazing ! Spellbinding ! Could n't shut up about them . Book 4 ? Hmmm . Maybe it 's a fluke . Maybe the author has been ill . But here now we have Book 5 and the realization that it 's no fluke . Martin has lost his way.Like every other reader I want the original characters and families to come back ! I want them to evolve grow up turn evil go mad save the world destroy the worldanything ! I could give two figs about the hundreds of new irrelevant windowdressing characters that were introduced in 4 and 5 OneEyed This OneArmed That the Giant the Forked Beard Green Grace Blue Grace Kindly Man . It 's exhausting . If there 's a prize for 'Most Useless Characters in a Single Novel ' Martin wins.The power house families have crumbled but rather than rebuild them Lady Catelyn appears only briefly in Book 4 despite her character 's fantastic potential for vengeance and villainry ! ! Martin has thrown us bones like Ramsay and Daario hoping that we will keep gnawing.Seriously I love George Martin 's writing and he tells a wonderful story but I 'm not sure I can endure a Number 6 . Maybe we 're all better off watching where HBO takes the story . ",0
"So many unfinished story lines . I do n't like being left hanging . Another exciting read . I read all the available books one right after the other . The best books i have read in a long time . I am already itching for the next book . Much better than the show . ",4
"This story is gripping . I look forward to reading this again . The plot has many unexpected turns . The experiences of the characters is palpable . ",3
"Awesome extension to the series hopefully we wo n't have to wait a million years for the next one like we did for this one ",3
"My husband enjoys this series of books.he s read all of them and looks forward to the rest in the series Thank you1 ",4
"After my husband and I read the first four books he wanted to read the last in this series . He loved it . I have not yet read the book but I am sure to those people who love the series and TV series will love it . ",4
"I liked all the books in this series . The characters are engaging and the writing is great . I 'm looking forward to the next book . ",3
"I read many of the negative reviews and I find that I can only agree with some who felt that a lot of the chapters dealing with Dany 's court problems were too long and quite tedious . The other great compliant I read was about the story not being moved forward . I disagree in that Martin has set out to create a world populated with characters you can believe in . In real life as you grow from youth into adulthood and then old age each of us encounters a myriad of characters . Some play a major role in our lives most do not . But all of them combine to contribute to the richness of our experience . I felt Martin was emulating life to a great degree in this fashion and what I took away from this read was the enjoyment of being given a further tour of a world that had captured my attention from the first volume of this saga . If Martin was any less adept at painting scenes with words this book would have been horrendously boring . As it is he still has the talent to whisk a reader away and show them the marvels of a world capable of harboring dragons . I just wish he was able to crank out the books faster but if the time waiting is needed in order to achieve this level of wordsmithing I can be patient . ",4
"I am pretty amazed by the number of people that say this is what I want to happen in the book or this is how I think this book should proceed ! . Oh really ! ! ! Attention all current and future readers of THE SONG OF FIRE AND ICE . This is George Martins book he is God of this books world and he will write the story and decide what happens that 's all . ",4
"What the heck George ? What are you trying to do to me ? I have invested my time and energy into these characters and them you kill them off like they are cannon fodder ! ! ! ! ! I waited forever for A Dance with Dragons to come out in paper back . I was not disappointed . It kept my attention right from the beginning until the end.waiting for something to happen.and I waited.I can not think of another author who can write a tomb of over one thousand pages who resolves nothing and leaves you wanting more . Where is the next book I want it now ! ! ! I need to know who wins the Game of Thrones . ",4
"It 's autumn in Westeros blizzards are already blasting the Seven Kingdoms with brutal force and winter is coming . Jon Snow is treading a dangerously fine line between keeping the vows of the Brothers of the Night 's Watch and involvement with King Stannis ' revolt . Tyrion is on the run for his life and hopes to find an ally with Queen Daenerys but as is always the case with the Imp he just manages to trade one peril for greater ones . It is Daenerys ' destiny to reclaim the Iron Throne for the Targaryens but doing so now means leaving her conquered city to her enemies and the slaves she has freed to their former masters . Meanwhile her dragons are growing bigger and more unmanageable . As all the great houses make their bid for who will rule the Seven Kingdoms north of the Wall the restless dead are gathering en masse to invade with the winter storms adding slain victims to their ranks.Just as all the previous books in A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE have been A Dance with Dragons is a tombstonesized doorstopper of a book . I purchased the Amazon Kindle version and I swear my Kindle was heavier after I uploaded it . An age has passed since A Game of Thrones kicked off what just might become the most influential series in fantasy since LORD OF THE RINGS . I 've been anticipating A Dance with Dragons ever since I read the last sentence of the last book A Feast for Crows almost six years ago.A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE is a colossalsized epic . There is no getting around the fact that this series is really one long book . I think Mr. Martin 's idea of a conclusion for each book has been to build up to the most shockingly climactic outcome imaginable and then leave the readers in a nearly painful lurch of a cliffhanger . Fair warning the ending of A Dance with Dragons is no exception . This is made almost intolerable by the fact that fans will be lucky to get more than one installment per decade.But if you can put all that aside and just take the events as they happen in A Dance with Dragons there 's no denying it 's another grand adventure.George R.R . Martin is one of those authors who could write the Yellow Pages and make it exciting . As complex and as largeaslife as this story is and even considering how long it 's been since I last visited his world I had no problem keeping up with A Dance with Dragons.Martin has created some of the most interesting characters ever and there are so many of them . It 's amazing how he can tell a story from so many unique perspectives . I 'm not sure I even know as many people living in the real world as there are living and dying within these books.He draws the plot out like a sharp blade from a scabbard one that will easily cut the careless . His underlying theme that every hero is the other side 's villain is profound and believable . All the players in this deadly game of thrones have a strategy that seems like a guaranteed victory . But since Martin solidly established early on that no one I repeat no one is safe it 's anyone 's guess who will hold the Iron Throne when this is done . Providing there will even be a throne to win . That will depend on the Crows holding the Wall against the wights and other monsters that have yet to strike in full force.It almost seems impossible that Martin will actually be able to wrap this thing up with a worthy conclusion and do it in both his and his readership 's lifetime . Call me crazy but I think he can . Afterwards blurbs on fantasy bookcovers will claim comparisons to George R.R . Martin and A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE like they do now for J.R.R . Tolkien and LORD OF THE RINGS . ",3
"Expect the unexpected . Martin writes a roller coaster story that will have you excited and anxious for the next page one moment and then screw with your emotions by killing one of your favorite characters . If you 're looking for a feel good read skip this book and shop the romance section . If what you want is drama action unexpected events and emotion read this series . Please George I need the next book . I 'm totally addicted . ",4
"After waiting what seemed to be forever for this installment to the Game of Thrones series I was rather disappointed . This piece of the story is typical Martin style and has the excellent flow to it . What it was lacking was the normal progress through the story line that we were so used to . A Feast for Crows and Dance with Dragons really should be combined into one book it would be humongous because after all they 're almost a reflection of each other but from opposite sides of the mirror . I guess Game of Thrones fans will have to wait another 4+ years for any progress on the story line to be made . ",2
"Great read . I cant wait for the last Book in this Series . I was very dissapointed that it will not be puplished in 2014 . ",4
"I really have grown to like the characters and look forward to see what happens to them next . The author has a lot of imagination . ",4
"With this latest book Martin has found a steady predictable pattern . It goes like thisStalling stalling stalling stalling interesting boring stalling stalling exciting a few paragraphs not a chapter boring boring boring stalling interesting boring stalling stalling exciting again only a few paragraphs boring boring boring stalling stalling stalling depressing depressing depressing.You come to realize that when something exciting happens you will turn the page the chapter will end abruptly and you will be whisked away to the most boring threads he has even if he has to make a few new irrelevant threads to do it.What I have come to realize is that my initial expectations were wrong . I expected an epic adventure but Martins intent does not seem to be to write a story in the usual sense . That is to say it is n't meant to have a beginning a middle and an end . There is no character who comes from humble beginnings works through his trials and saves Westeros in the end . What Martin is writing is more like one of those generational dramas . The characters mill about and then die and their sons and cousins mill about and then die . The value in this type of book is that it gives you a thorough look at life in an interesting time and place but they are seldom what I would call entertaining.If I had known this would be a generational drama instead of an epic adventure I would not have bothered in the first place . Martin can be a great writer when he wants to but he is in desperate need of a strong editor who can help him with plotting and pacing . I will not be buying the next books when they come out . Instead if by some miracle he lives long enough to finish them all I will have a look at the final chapters and decide then if there is enough payoff to justify sludging through the final books . ",1
"Very disappointing . A huge let down from previous books in the series . Not sure I will buy the next book . ",1
"Not to the level of the first three books.not by far . Dance was long ponderous with little action of forward movement . The characters were stuck.doing nothing . Pages and pages of traveling on ships pining for cute sellswords worrying about food and making beds for wildings etc . The major characters are on the way to do something but all we get is..on the way.What is most depressing is knowing that we have to wait for five years for the next book..so I have to live with this bad taste in my mouth for that long.Dissapointing for Martin who is a great writer but better than the average book . ",2
"The story just keeps going and I love the movie based on these books but they ca n't keep either of them coming out quick enough for me . ",4
"When George started killing characters that I loved I bit the bullet and plowed on thinking that it would be all right in the end that some of them would prevail and win if you will but it seems as if he knows no other plot twist than to kill off many of the characters and then maybe bring them back with the magic we were told was not that prevalent in this world . Martin has lost the plot quite literally . He has lost control of his characters and the narrative and knows no way to contritely wrap up a storyline . The story goes nowhere in book five and a character that I have been rooting for since book one may have been killed off making all of his efforts wasted if this is so it is a disgrace but even more so if he is brought back by some mystical rite . I have lost all faith in this series add another onestar to the pile . ",0
"Overall Its worth 5 stars but this comes with the frustrations of several dangling story lines that wo n't be continued until the next book in the series possibly out in 2014 . Some story lines were enjoyable while others were difficult to accept . The story lines that I look forward to the most pertain to Arrya Tyrion and Brienne . ",4
"Wow I am enthralled by this series . The story landscape and characters are exciting . I hope Mr. Martin can produce the next book in the next year of two . Thank goodness for the TV series . ",4
"I liked this better than a feast of crows I can also understand some of the bad reviews but with this series it 's not so much about the minor endings as the journey . ",3
"So nice to read about the main characters form the first book again . Everything starts adding together . Looking forward every time my eyes close for the night and to the next evening where I get the opportunity to read the book again ",3
"I am completely hooked on the Game of Thrones series but somewhat disappointed with Dance With Dragons . Just ca n't get past the feeling the author is introducing many new characters to keep the series going while sacrificing the more important plot introduced in the first book . The author makes excuses for some chapters being out of sequence and it 's just that.an excuse.Hey Amazon you charged me more for Dance With Dragons for my Kindle than I would pay for a paperback ! ! Do n't think we have n't noticed ! ",2
"Great book . No character is sacred . This allows for true suspense and emotion as you connect with the characters . Great read ",4
"This is likely the last one of the series I will read . I understand that our lives often seem to be an endless circling around issues and seeking after elusive goals but somehow reading endless anecdotes of characters with whom we 've become involved is not my idea of a great read . I wanted some resolution to the chaos of their livesbut it only happened with one Jon Snow . ",3
"I feel that the author has lost interest in the real story in book 5 and is just interested in adding new people just to keep the books going . keeps killing off the people that you become familiar with just to add new people . I did like the other 4 books . ",2
"As a continuation of characters I 've grown to love and a connection to what I am guessing may happen in future books this held its ground . I adore this seriesthe world the ruthlessness with which Martin orchestrates it and the way he has sucked me fully and completely into anticipating future outcomes . I have theories I want to talk to people about it . Not since Harry Potter have I been so invested.But this book does n't stand alone . It is a piece of a whole so as a book it falls down a little . The first three of the series were sublime the 4th and 5th less sohe has sprawled the story a bit too thin . I just hope that in the last two he is able to pull back to the magic he created initially . I believe he will middles are often unruly but I suspect less patient people may be annoyed . ",3
"I love this series . Only gripe is that the story is so long that I ca n't remember half the plot of what I already read . Ca n't wait to read the next 2 . ",4
"It saddens me to say this but GRRM has fallen from the throne of the best writer . Where the first three books were pieces of art A Dance with Dragons just like its predecessor represents a continued downward spiral of a once great series . I absolutely can not understand how an author with consistent good writing in first three books can mess up so badly . Suffice it say I found myself skipping through the book . The book was too long and accomplished too little . The POV characters seem to be frozen in time while we are reading about other POV characters . It is safe to say that GRRM has hit a writer 's block because only that can explain this disaster of a book . I say disaster because I had high expectations from GRRM honestly speaking this was an average fantasy book but it does n't deserve to be in the same series as a Game of thrones Feast for Crows and Storm of Swords . All I have left to say is that its high time to let this dying horse to be put out of its misery . ",1
"As always another great book written . Now on to the next ! I always hate go be left hanging on for the next book . ",4
"I thought this book was a great addition to this seriesI was upset at the end when it seemed that my favorite character is murdered . However I enjoyed the journey ",4
"I bought them separately instead of in the group so it is easier to find which book I am in . Highly recommend them if you like the scififantasy genre . So much vivid detail good storytelling and even better than the TV adaptation . ",4
"Ok I just finished DwD and I wanted to share my thoughts . But before I do a little background infoI started with the HBO series and was just awestruck by it . After watching all ten episodes on HBOGoin 3 days ! I knew I had to read the bookslike yesterday . I am not a fan of fantasy novels and less so of series which require so much of its readers . Regardless I jumped in head first . I started GoT a month ago and much to the horror of my husband and kids did n't come up for air until I had finished DwD.I have read the reviews and while I understand why some people would n't like the pace as much as the other books I have to say that I was not disappointed . Yes its slower and YES I heeded the warnings and skipped most of Dany 's chapters as well as large portions of Tyrion's.Im still giving this book 4 stars . I wont go into a detailed review as there are fans who have done that and better than I could . I just want to say that if youre invested in the series you will be doing yourself a disservice by skipping this . GRRM has n't let us down only changed our course a bit.There were some slow parts granted . But the story . Oh the story ! Im still lost in the world he created still rooting for DanyTyrion the remaining Starks and my sweet hero Jon Snowor whoever he may actually be . Im also rooting for characters I had long written off as unlikable or worse . I believe in GRRM and Im just as engrossed with ASOIF as ever . ",3
"A lot of what the other reviewers say has merit . The story does not progress much from the last book and it could have used a bit more editing . I never got to a point in this book where I absolutely could n't put it down even to go to sleep a point I reached many many times in the first 3 books in the series but I also never had to force myself to pick it up again like I did for the first half of a Feast for Crows The second half of Feast totally redeemed the book for me though . A lot of Dance for Dragons is a build up to the next book but there is enough new food for thought to keep it interesting and Martin 's writing is so good his characters and the universe that they inhabit so rich that the book is still thoroughly enjoyable . ",3
"I have n't quite finished the book as yet but I am loving it as much as I loved all the others . The attention to detail as well as the unpredictability of the story has me on the edge of my chair . I am just wondering how long we have to wait for book 6 and from what I understand book 7 ? Keep up the good work Mr. Martin you are amazing . ",4
"I loved all the books this one is no exception . It actually gets better and I would recommend it to everyone . If you wonder if the series is worth watching if you watched the TV show then yes it is . I started with the show and then bought all the books and read them in a matter of 4 or 5 weeks . It 's this kind of addictive books you ca n't stop reading . Trust me Mr Martin is awesome . ",4
"I enjoyed the first three books of the series but the last two left me feeling cheated and sorry that I had ever started reading A Song of Ice and Fire . I feel like Martin could have cut out a lot of pointless material and given us a satisfying trilogy with a real ending . Instead I wasted a lot of time and money as I slogged to the end hoping for resolution . I have told my husband who has watched the TV series not to bother reading it.The best thing I can say about the series as a whole is that the books had really good titles.A Dance with Dragons was the worst of the series . It goes round and round like water down a toilet bowl . I kept thinking at least one story line would reach a satisfying conclusion but alas it appears Mr. Martin just gave up.Normally when I read a series that I enjoy I seek out everything else that author has written . Even though I have heard good things about Martin 's earlier work this series has left me with no desire to investigate . ",1
"As with any series I recommend you read the books in order . Because this is how I read I ca n't remember where this particular book begins and where the previous one ends . A Song of Fire And Ice is an exceptional story and I recommend it to anyone who will listen . The only thing that is difficult is it is SO detailed and there are SO many characters it 's easy to get lost and feel like you need some sort of reference guide . Which you actually have in the back of the book I 've never been much of a fantasy reader but my sister is and this has been her favorite series since the 1990 's when she first discovered A Clash of Kings . The first book I will warn you tho this series has yet to be completed and with the author continuing to write and publish other stories right now it 's easy to start feeling an inappropriate hatred and annoyance for the author as it seems he knows about and is therefore flaunting the power he has over his readers . ",3
"The whole series is fabulous . I started reading the book because the TV series progressed too slowly I like the way mr Martin tells the story and even though he is criticized for being overly descriptive if blood lines and the composition of dinner menus I enjoy how he builds an image of a coherent world with different cultures that can be sensed through various aspects . The story telling has gained some pace and this book like the others in the series have some amazing plot twists that you can not expect at all unless you 've heard spoilers but still they surprise you.A must read for every fantasy book lover .

"I 've actually read this book and have updated my review accordingly . the first time I read the book I found it very slow and meandering compared to the previous installments . However having decided to give it another chance I realized that I was a little hasty in my judgement . The book though not as good as the first three is still beautifully written and the Reek story line in particular is touching . ca n't help thinking the ending was a bit of a let down but then we do have the next book still to come !

"once again mr martin has strayed off the story and A dance of dragons was a disappointment . I had been waiting for some closure . Where is the war that was due ? what happened to those characters we fell in love with in westeros ? ? book 4 went over the cliff and book 5 hit rock bottom.Please Mr. Martin get back in the groove take us back to westerow and finish what was a stunning colorful whole heeated story so many of us fell in love with ",1
"I want to get to the end now and I never want to get to the end of this book ! And I hope this book series never ends . The TV series are good but as always the books are far better . ",4
"That 's what reading reviews on Amazon can do to you I had been enjoying with strong enthusiasm the serie up to the fourth where I started struggling with lesser characters too much of Cercei and a lack of the more interesting ones . Then I started checking about it on Amazon and a very good review started to give me doubts . It stated that the serie was very unlikely to end due to the very slow pace of writing of Mr Martin . As I was tired by my reading of the fourth I did put the reading of the fifth on standby.What a mistake ! In fact A dance with Dragons fits in the serie perfectly well . I wo n't spoil anything which means I wo n't say much by consequence about the story . Enough to say that Jon Tyrion Daenarys Arya are here again . There are many very nice moments where my heart started beating faster.Let me assume that you have read up to the end of the fourth at this stage . I will state that A Dance with Dragons is the complement of the fourth as books intended to set the stage properly before continuing with the story.I do personally like the writing style of Mr Martin so I wo n't complain about him taking too long . I guess it is a question of taste if you want a fast paced serie this one may not be for you . I do enjoy when the story stretches specifically when the characters are interesting . It creates a kind of intimacy for me with them.Do not get fooled by believing that nothing happens in the book . The story develops itself in many different directions some kind of expected and some absolutely not foreseen by me.If my memory is correct and if there have not been any updates since the last time I checked the six one is supposed to be a few years after the end of the fifth . I am impatientely waiting for it I am still afraid it may take the author as many years to write the next book than for this one . This means five years ! ! ! Hopefully HBO 's interest may lead him to increase his pace but I am just speculating.ConclusionIf you have come up to the fifth book of the serie you can not be anything else but a fan . Or you like torturing yourself Anyway if you were disappointed by the fourth and its lack of really interesting characters this one will restore your enthousiasm . Good reading ! ",4
"I 'm a fan of the game of thrones series and my son got this for me as a gift . Started reading it and I have not been able to put it down except to write this review . ",4
"I give 5 star ratings to books that keep me up well past my bedtime and that leave me wanting more when I get to the last page . Anyone who loves fantasy will want to read this but the characters and action transcend the genre and should appeal to anyone who enjoys any kind of adventure . The only caution is that the violence and sexuality may offend certain readers otherwise enjoy . ",4
"I 've been reading these books for over a year now and I just love this world more than I can ever express . I do n't want the series to ever end ! ",4
"The author appears to be using a Soap Opera formula . You know where you watch the episode for 30 minutes and the plot progresses for about 15 seconds or not at all . I kept wondering is this some form of writers ADD or has George gotten hopelessly lost in his own story lines . Too bad this could have been a epic series some of the story lines are fascinating and the character 's rich but it has fallen and it ca n't get up . ",0
"I 'm a fan of the Song of Ice and Fire books but I have to say compared to the first three books things are starting to take an ominous turn . If I was talking about the story getting darker that would be a good thing but sadly I 'm not . Let me explainIn the early books things moved quite nicely along . Plots were plotted intrigues were intriguing and action was thick and fast.As the series has progressed however things have taken a decidedly odd turn which I 'll label The Robert Jordan effect . Now I like Jordan 's books but at a particular point his Wheel of Time series ground to a halt and endless irrelevant characters were introduced for no good reason whatsoever . This is what appears to be happening to GRRM 's Ice and Fire books . Irrelevant characters ? How about Asha Greyjoy ? Grinding to a halt ? How about this very book ! If one summarised what happened in Dance with Dragons it would go something like Characters wander about a bit the plot does n't progress more than a hair 's breadth and hoped for meetings and resolutions do n't happen.I wish I could be more positive about the book but this is the first of Martin 's works that I 've actually started skimming paragraphs because I felt they were pointless and uninteresting . This is usually a really bad sign for me since I like long epic books and series . I like a lot of grist and fat to chew on in a story . But when that fat turns out to be rancid I 'll spit it out and give it a miss thank you very much.There is also an increasing incidence of what I 'll refer to as Time dilation going on . Martin will spend two hundred pages describing an unimportant trek for one of the characters . Later another character seems to teleport from one place to another without any detail of the journey whilst that same character elsewhere has other travels painstakingly detailed.The entirety of the book could be condensed down into three hundred pages or so without losing any of the substance or important details in the story.I 've given this three stars but that is more out of respect for the earlier works . I hope the next installment sh9ows a decline in Martin 's tendency to pad things out . ",2
"This book is between 2 and 3 star for me and I 'm being generous with the 3 rather than 2 given the previous booksI just got done reading the book and wowit was really disappointing in many respects . Fantasy books are suppose to entertain us not lock us into some boring tale to stroke the writers ego for his ability to describe every flower and every stone in the world created . There were some great parts to the book but overall Martin seems to been afflicted by the Robert Jordan syndrome of getting far too enraptured and engulfed in his own yarn being spun that he gets tied up in knots . This book was indeed a VERY long yarn just as many of the later books in the Wheel of Time series before Sanderson took over . This book is just simply boring and extremely repetitive is so many parts that I found myself forcing me way through arts of the tale . I 'll forgo any deep spoilers but one of the most interesting characters in the story has been Tyrion but what the heck was up with his boat trip ? Another of my favorite Characters Jon SnowI 'll save any spoiler here but I was HIGHLY disappointed with regards to his development in the story I also think I clearly know where he 's going with this anglewhich is only adding to my dissapointment . Yet another POV that consumes so much of this bookDaenerysWTF Martin ? ! ? ? ! What happened to the confident queen that had arisen in the previous book ? ! ? ! ? Bran 's tale was a dead endand I 'm not sure where he 's going with that but at least we saw movement with that . The only saving grace of the book was My favorite of the series Aryamy fingers are crossed but there is A LOT of horizon movement on her story as well.I had enjoyed the series because of the gritty writing and Martin 's boldness in having all cards on the table in telling the tale . I 've always dislike writers who heavily rely on gotcha plot devices and cheap mechanics to get plot moved but this book was riddled with it to an unprecedented level . With two books projected to be left in the story I ca n't see how it is going to be remotely possible for Marin to tie up all his loose ends without gutting the plot and heavily rely on even more plot devices to reach a conclusion . The even worst alternative is a money grab and extension of the series to additional books past the stated 7th one . I only started reading this series 2 years ago so I did n't have the painful 5 year wait but likely if he takes that long for the next book I 'm almost going to skip it . ",2
"Continuing the story with new alliances . Are the dragons a bonus or a detriment . Just always want more . Characters keep evolving in fascinating ways . ",4
"I felt this book was just awful and will now stop reading this series . It offended me that reviewers thought him to be an American Tolkien when his writing and vision are so far from what Tolkien created . Tolkien created a deep world full of challenges and magic and hope in what is good . Not to mention that his writing was transcendent.Martin creates a brutal world where babies are eaten by wargs and murders are featured as main characters and morality has little meaning . Who really cares what happens to many of these petty characters and who cares who wins the battle for this world ? Not me any longer . Horrible and meaningless to me . Nothing at all to compared with Tolkien . ",0
"This was such an exciting series so much foreshadowing hints of plots to come intrigues to play out . The problem is that none of it ever happens . This author has no plan . He just writes very well but I do n't think he even remember book one . Tolkien he 's not . Too bad . ",0
"A Dance With Dragons I found is much the same as the rest of the Game of Thrones series with plots running in a dozen different directions characters making bizarre choices or being killed off just for the sake of it.I can understand the idea behind trying to make it realistic but it is a book and could try to use a bit more imagination and have a few more happy endings instead of killing off good and interesting characters all the time . I keep telling myself surely one of the Stark children remaining will turn up at Winterfell to claim their fathers seat but remain disapointed . Maybe in the next book one can only hope . ",2
"Some of the characters in this book were killed off in an earlier book.It was confusing at best and more characters added when we wanted toknow what happened to the others ? Is there another book coming ? ? ? ? ? ? It did not finish very well.I was totally disappointed.Jon was attacked and we do n't know if he is dead or alive where is Sansaand Littlefinger and Lady Katelyn ? This book was very long and very little of it tied together.I loved the other four this one was hard to read . ",1
"I wo n't go into detail since many others have done a far better job than I can . I 'm only about 13 through this book so far . I was very disappointed in Feast for Crows and this book will join that one in the disappointment category . Storm of Swords was sooooo good ! I did n't expect the 4th and 5th books in the series to be as good especially since I had read the reviews but my gosh . I 'd say it 's a fast read because you can skip a lot except in places it 's so boring that I tend to fall asleep I only have time to read at night . I wanted to read Dance with Dragons right away since I have been reading the entire series this year after getting hooked on the HBO show . All I can say is I hope Winds of Winter is better and does n't take Mr. Martin 5 years to publish because in 5 years not only will I have forgotten everything I 've read but I may not care . I guess if you 're a fan of the Song of Fire and Ice as I am this is a must read as I considered it but be prepared to slog through it and be prepared for the characters to act differently than they did in Storm of Swords . 'Nuff said . ",1
"George RR Martin always claimed he needed the 5year gap between Feast for Crows and Dance to deliver a quality product and worked tirelessly on this sequel . To me despite the long wait the book reads more like a rushed effort that was not really edited at all . There are multiple redundancies in the plotlines and many chapters that don ` t move the plot at all.Even worse the initial plan to divide several Point of View characters storylines Dorne Iron Islands Kings Landing etc . in Feast Meereen The Wall etc . in Dance is not followed through as several Feast characters appear in Dance . The books were once intended to be published as a single volume but now one would like to reorganize the disjointed chapterstimelines again . The character development of Daenerys is written badly she is a mere damsel in distress in this book unlikely given her development in the previous sequels . And Martin also overuses dramatic cliffhangers in this installment.The good news Many chapters except the Daenerys storyline are very readable it is certainly a better novel than Feast for Crows and even if it doesn ` t help the plot development the place & landscape descriptions make it a pleasure to get lost in Westeros or Meereen Ghis etc . again . This author can still write if he only would put some effort and dedication in it . But I have now serious doubts that all loose ends and cliffhangers can be advanced to a satisfying conclusion of the series . ",2
"If you 're reading reviews for A Dance with Dragons chances are you 've read the previous books in the same series and by now you know whether you want to know what happens next or not so there 's really no purchase advice to give hereA Dance with Dragons is very much in line with the rest of the series in terms of quality . George R.R . Martin is still the same fantasticsadistic combo and we can only regret that the plot does n't move forward much despite the book being over 1000 pages . That said if you like the universe and the characters there 's no reason not to read it and be prepared to wait a few more years before the saga comes to its conclusion . ",3
"I continue to love the way it 's written although I want to know the ending for each character already ! I waited until I could make the purchase on sale..sorry I waite so long . ",4
"This volume is as good as its predecessors . Martin has so far surpassed Jordan in current Epic fantasy though like Jordan he may pass the ideal point for a conclusion . ",4
"hoyt mcguyerThis being the last book I wish to say here and now I want more ! ! ! .It took me 2 months to work my way through the first 4 . I drug my feet on this one knowing the story ends here.As far as I 'm concerened thats the only down side to the collection . It ends . ",4
"A Dance with Dragons is the fifth book in George R.R . Martin 's A Song of Ice and Fire series on which HBO 's Game of Thrones is based with season one covering the first book . It does not however follow the traditional pattern of picking up where the fourth book left off . Rather due to the fourth book ballooning out of control during writing A Dance with Dragons picks up where the third book left off . A Feast for Crows book 4 was limited to the action in south Westeros and Braavos A Dance for Dragons concentrates primarily on the action in the North the Free Cities not including Braavos and Slaver 's Bay . Not until more than halfway through the book is a plot thread from the fourth book continued chronologically . And make no mistake the concentration is all on the North and Essos . Only six chapters of the seventythree total take place in the south of Westeros . While this leads to greatly missed fan favorites being heavily featured Tyrion Jon and Daenerys POVs combine for almost half of the chapters in the book other fan favorites are almost absent Arya Jamie and Cersei POVs combine for only five chapters . There is no shortage of action and politics as Jon tries to prepare for the coming of the Others Stannis and Roose Bolton maneuver for control of the North and possible allies and ruthless enemies begin to converge on Daenerys.The split between A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons causes some issues neither feels like a solid standalone novel but it makes sense not just geographically but in terms of an inflection point in the story . A Feast for Crows in many ways wrapped up most of the major plotlines that drove the first three novels while A Dance with Dragons features storylines previously on a side stage becoming the main show . Martin appears to be well on his way to righting the ship after stumbling and if the sixth book is weak it can not be blamed on its predecessors . I personally rank the book above only A Feast for Crows in the series but very close to A Clash of King which is perhaps praising with faint damnation.For all of its good points basically everything I do n't specifically mention in this review the book is not without its weaknesses . The plot continues to suffer from a greatly reduced pace lacking the breathtaking rush to climax of the first three books . Much of the suspense of the story has subsided as well and the climax is minor compared to that of earlier books . This is probably unavoidable for a middle book forced to worry more about transition than anything else . What is not unavoidable are Martin 's portrayals of the good guys in positions of leadership they frustrate as Martin continues to mistake justice for cruelty honor for stupidity mercy for weakness and leadership for an inability to listen .

"I would review this book if I could get my hands on a paperback edition . I am waiting for it to come out in paperback so I can read the book . The hardback is too heavy for me to carry around with me . It 's been 2 years what 's the hold up ? ",0
"Let me precede this review by saying that in my opinion this is the worst of any of the 5 ASOIAF books . I even enjoyed it less than AFFC . Why then am I giving the book 5 stars ? Because it is an excellent book ! Being the worst of a spectacular series does not equate being bad.What I dislike about the book Some parts truly did just drag on . Also I disliked certain characters that were added to the book . Specifically Old and Young Griff . I found that their addition completely upended the story without any good reason for doing so . They are pretty boring and I hope they die.Overall I found myself unable to put the book down . I blazed through it in about 9 days of heavy reading . George RR Martin really does know how to flesh out a story . The environments he develops are rich the characters are endearing and intriguing and the story is engaging . Despite the slow plot progression a number of the plots really did have interesting unexpected and delightful twists . It was a wonderful experience reading through the book . I wish I always had a book that I loved as much by my side life would be so enhanced.I recommend this book to anyone who has read and enjoyed the first four books . Sure we are going to have to wait years for the next release assuming it happens but that does not change the fact that this book is superbly executed and a wonder to behold.Highly enjoyed . Highly recommended . ",4
"I started reading this series recently so I did not have to endure years of waiting between books . This probably makes me less annoyed about the extraneous bloat found particularly in the first half of the book that seems to have put off many of the other reviewers . And yes there are cliffhangers . But there have been cliffhangers in all the other installments so it 's not a huge surprise that the author resorted to more of the same . And with 2 more books scheduled in the series the next one is also unlikely to bring resolution to most of the story lines.That said I enjoyed the majority of the story . Do I wish I knew more of what happens to everyone ? Do I wish that the first half of the book was pared down by thoughtful editing ? Do I wonder exactly where the author is going with this ? Do I hope I do n't have to wait 5 years until the next one is published ? Do I wish I had my own dragon ? Yes yes yes yes and yes ! But it was still a worthwhile read and I look forward to the finding out what is next in store to these interesting and flawed characters and the dragons ",3
"All the books in this series are wonderful reads . Some are better than others but when compared against other series this is one of the best . This book is sans amazing moments found in some of he other books but it 's hard to craft one of those moments . They just happen . A couple of the story threads become a little maddening since main characters tend to brush against one another without interaction . But that 's really the lone complaint I have . ",4
"I really enjoyed the beginning of the series but feel now he 's got so many characters that he is n't moving the story forward and a lot of it just dragged for me . I have to say with as long as he takes to write the series I do n't know if when the 6th book in the series comes out whether I 'll pick it up again or not . It just seems like he gets you interested in a character only to get rid of them in some horrible way and then pick up the story with characters you did n't even like or was interesting enough at the start to continue the story . ",1
"I was so looking forward to the 5th book in this seriesat first I did n't realize that there would be a 6th book and was soooo disappointed.I hope the 6th book wraps up all the loose ends left at the end of A Dance with Dragonsand it gets released soon ! ",2
"I had a professor once that said you should make any work of art strange enough to be interesting but if you get too weird people will get bored and go do something else . I had a lot of time to think about that precept while I was reading this book because my mind was constantly wandering as I dutifully trudged through these tedious pages.Maybe I should start off by saying I really loved the first two or three books . In most books you 're willing to put up with a certain amount of what you could call informational garbage . Pages that are n't necessary to the plot but they fill out the characters in an interesting way . The detail on the whaling industry in Moby Dick is an oftennoted example . There seems to be a lot of dalliance for its own sake in these books and although at first it 's something I put up with and even enjoyed somewhere the balance tipped and beyond that point the book became a slog.I read one review the title of which was apt and creative The song has become a noodling free jam . When a main character dies it 's exciting and chilling and you wonder who 's going to fill the power vacuum . But after five books they 're dropping like flies you invest time and emotion in a major charismatic player they get murdered and you stop seeing the value in emotional investment . On the other side of that same coin so many of these dead characters become magically resurrected that it 's usually two or three hundred pages before I allow myself to believe that someone is actually dead.I wanted to finish the book so even though I was n't enjoying it per se I plowed through the final three or four hundred pages . The ending of the book was like the beginning and the middle . Seemed somewhat vague and unsatisfying why should we care about these characters ? Where 's the trajectory ? What 's the point ? ",1
"The first three books in this series are a wonderful reinvention of a tired genre the epic fantasy novel . Many have compared Martin to Tolkein in the process and it 's true that they have each invented a complete Otherworld real and yet alien filled with acutely realized characters.But Martin stumbled in Book Four and falls in this Book Five in the series.There 's some good here . Thankfully Tyrion is back and Arya continues to be a complex and enigmatic character . Some of the intrigue on the Wall with winter falling is gripping . When the dragons eventually appear they are as fearsome as dragons should be.But much of the rest of this book is dull nonsense please fans do n't flame me ! . It goes on and on and on and on . I skipped pages of filler . Many of the plotturns feel false and hurried . In the final chapters the book falls apart . There are so many incidental characters it becomes pointless to try and follow the numerous subplots that in any event are n't interesting . I could go on but I 'd be committing Martin 's sin of saying far too much over and over again.What happened Mr Martin ? ? ? ",1
"I loved the first three books of the series but the fourth seemed half a book and went nowhere not surprisingly since Martin claimed that it was half of a book and the other half would be out in no time . After five years we get this absolutely worthless excuse for a book . Chapter after chapter introduces one or two characters moves the plot forward infinitesimally and then skips onto the next . Half way through I realised that even if I finished the book there would still be TWO MORE to come by 2023 given his present pace . I think that he has written himself into a corner he has no idea of how the plot will end if it ever will . ",0
"love all the characters ! the plot ! the twists ! I just did n't like at all that the book did n't have an ending I 'm waiting for the next book anxiously ! ",4
"Woohoo I liked it although the epilogue was the best part . Although I will read it again once the whole series is written . ",4
"While ADWD was for me an entertaining read for the most part partly because I had nothing else to do at the time many of the stories go nowhere . GRRM said he just had too much for the sequel to a Storm of Swords to fit into one book and so we get two books one featuring Cersei slooooowly destroying the Lannister legacy at King 's Landing and a bunch of random side characters barely doing anything . In this one most of his 'star ' characters do jack s as well.Tyrion Maybe the worst chapters aside from the first two chapters Tyrion basically rides on a boat going to see Dany and he basically plays Westero 's chess with some Targaryan relatives that have before been completely unintroduced and have established no reason to care about them . Tyrion meets these characters and has tons of inner monologue about everyone on the ship and with him is another midgetgirl who as another Amazon review noted is the equivelent of Jar Jar Binks for ASOIAF . Tyrion never makes it to his destination and instead slogs around in chapters that try to hook you for example Tyrion seeing stone people who pull him over the ship whoa where 's this going did Tyrion diDO N'T WORRY everything in the chapters afterwards are the exact same as the preceding ones Tyrion on a boat . SNOREDaenery 's GURM seems to have a running theme throughout AFFC & ADWD where women apparently ca n't rule for sjust like real life . Dany feeling good about freeing the city from slavery now faces starvation and disease and prettymuch takes all of her advisers advice while she day dreams about Daario . Like Tyrion her chapters are sluggish and neverending and I found myself skimming through her chapters . Despite the book 's title the dragons are locked up for most of the book not doing anything while we follow the mother of dragons failing miserably at ruling . Finally near the last two chapters something starts to happen then the book 's over . Yay.Jon His chapters are a little more interesting . He 's basically trying to organize the wildlings and night 's watch to work together for the impending white walkers as well as tolerating Stannis ' wife and ignoring Melisandre 's advice . By the end of the book not much happened here too but the chapters were still interesting enough to read all the way . Then he suddenly dies . Lol.TheonReek By far the best chapters in ADWD we see what was once Theon after the tortures of the Dreadfort accompany the Bolton 's to Winterfell to establish their claim to the North . His chapters were not only pageturners that kept me up at night but they were also haunting in many ways . These chapters alone made the read worthwhile.While there 's some good stuff to cherry pick out of A Dance with Dragons and the read was fun for the most part I reflected on the book afterword and realized not much happened . The major characters that established themselves in A Storm of Swords kind of just stagnate in the same place chapterafterchapter while the new characters are thrown into the story without any development or hook and not much of value has happened by the end of it . In the first three books Westero 's felt like a giant chess board each major character making a decision was like the pieces moving around the board changing the outcome drastically but by now it feels like GURM ran out of steam . Seems after killing off a lot of major characters he does n't know what to do with the ones he has left . I 'm just going to admit it I miss the war of 5 kings.Also why does he insist on cliffhangers now ? They were in the prior books sure but so much has happened prior that it felt like a major set up to the next book . Here pretty much all you have is the cliffhangers . John Briene Cersei and Daenary 's all barely do anything until their final chapters then GURM just stops the book and says to us WILL THE WALL SURVIVE ? WHO WILL WIN THE BATTLE OF WINTERFELL ? WHAT DID BRIENNE SAY TO CATELYN ? AND WILL WOMEN EVER RULE COMPETENTLY ? lol no TUNE IN NEXT TIME TO FIND OUT ! complete with cheesy organ music in the background . How about instead of saving that s for the end and meanwhile writing about food in pornographic detail GURM fleshes out the story more instead of letting it stagnate . It 'll be a real shame if ASOIAF never picks up after these two slumps . ",2
"WARNING ! SPOILER ALERT The author should spend less time with the hbo series and more time with decent writing . This series started out great . It has become nothing but a mishmash of drivel by book 5 . Too many characters with no substance.. Nothing but pages of mindless meaningless words that drag on but do not advance the storyline . If the author had stuck to the major characters and expanded upon them instead of killing them all off the book could have been on the level of Tolkein 's work . That comparison has now been lost . What is left to look forward to after the author has killed off Ned Stark Caitlyn Stark Joffrey Robb Stark Brienneand a host of others . Now we 're left with Jon Snow stabbed 4 times and no knowledge of his fate at the end of book 5.. Is he dead or not ? This is tiresome . The few remaining characters need to 'grow up ' in the next book and the Stark children should be returned to Winterfell with the help of Jon Snow to rebuild . It would be perfectly legit for Tommen or some king to release Jon from his vows to the blackwatch so he could stay on as their protector along with perhaps Sam as their Maester and help Gilly raise both 'babe 's or something along those lines . I 'm just weighted down with the total chaos of this series . I keep waiting for the author to understand that we have no reason to have any kind of attachment to the books or characters when we know he 's just going to kill them off anyway.. So why bother ? Enough of the frivolous killing off good characters . Something good needs to happen and stay happened . lets MAKE SOME PROGRESS ! I 'm so disgusted with this series that I 'm pretty much done with it.. If it remains this stagnant I wo n't be buying anymore . there was enough good material in these 5 books to have made 2 possibly 3 great books but the inclusion of so much drivel and wasted characters has expanded it to really tiresome reading . Just way too much froth . It 's beginning to sound juvenile and in no way written by the same person who started the series . This author is losing his audience to anger and a angry audience wo n't buy his work anymore . No one wants a constant let down . Just my humble opinion . ",0
"seriously some elements in book 5 really reminded me of the wheel of time this dude needs some original thought . i did love ht first 3 books tho . ",2
"The only thing I disliked about the book was that it could have been pared down without losing the story thread . If Both this book and the last had been edited with an eye towards moving the plot forward we could have had one book instead of two .

"PreReview Rant One thing is certain when it comes to a truly good epic fantasy series like this one . The longer the series goes the more the author does NOT repeat himself the more complex and intricate the plot becomes the less each book stands alone the more thought provoking each installment the more popular the louder the most critical fans will proclaim their discontent.A Dance with Dragons feels more like the first book of A Song of Ice and Fire 's second major arc than a sequel to A Storm of Swords . The first arc depicting the War of the Five Kings took up the first three books while A Feast for Crows is both an epilogue to the first arc and a stepping stone into the second arc . Dance builds off the world Martin created up to this point and takes it in a whole new direction while still staying true to all that has come before.This is my favorite book in the series so far . Well worth the 6 year wait but then again I 've always felt authors should take their time rather than rush but maybe that 's just me.Dance is in turns funny I laughed out loud more times during this book than any of the previous ones combined heartbreaking should I be too much of a man to admit I cried cried like a baby ? awe inspiring there were multiple scenes that left me breathless frustrating in a good way frightening okay I 'll stop with the parentheticals now epic adventurous mysterious and every other thing that an epic fantasy novel should be . The plot is steeped in history and political intrigue the characters pop off the page and the settings leave you almost breathless in their beauty.And of course Martin does what he has always done best . He keeps you guessing . Just when you think you know what 's going to happen Psych ! I 'm not going to put any spoilers in this review . He takes characters we know and love and then plays boggle with our heads . People we despised before suddenly become sympathetic while people we once loved supremely get on our nerves . He also brings into the forefront new characters who are every bit as entertaining as the ones we 've lost.The only real criticism I have when it comes to A Dance With Dragons is the pacing early on . I got over that quickly enough though when I thought of it as the companion novel to A Feast for Crows . While I read I always tried to keep in mind what was happening in Feast at the same time . I hope someday GRRM comes out and releases A Feast for Dragons or A Dance with Crows and puts all the chapters together into one volume as they were originally meant to be . ",4
"I read the five existing books back to back . There will be two more yet to be written . These books are so long that by the last book I just wanted to be done with them . Do n't get me wrong the story is definitely worth reading . The characters are rich and colorful . The HBO series really brings these books to life . If you ca n't read the books definitely see the HBO series . This series is full of interesting characters . Sometimes it 's difficult to keep all the characters straight . But there is a list of characters and relationships to each other at the end of each book . The author 's style is very easy to read . I would definitely suggest this series to my friends . And I 'll read the final two books when they are released . ",3
"Love Love Love Games of Thrones series . However the last installment of the series has n't grabbed me as the previous ones have . I am enjoying catching up with the activities of my favorite characters who were left out of the last book but it seems to be off to a sluggish start . I admit that I have n't finished the book yet and will . Maybe there have been too many characters introduced in the beginning making the catching up a little more tedious . I am sure I will be anxiously awaiting the next installment ! Come on George get that next one ready soon . ",3
"Anything written by Martin is consistently excellent and I am a loyal fan of this series . There are some chapters in the second half of the book that are among the best he 's ever written but I must agree with most of the reviews that say the plot goes nowhere . Martin is just moving his characters around like chess pieces in order to get them in position for the final two books . He should have stuck with his original plan and kept Book 4 and 5 together and edited it down a bit fans would not have said no to buying it . I can not give him less than four stars for Dance but when I was finished reading it I felt as though there should have been more going on in over 1000 pages then there was . Hope we do n't have to wait five years for the next volume . ",3
"for the second straight book turning the series into a song of waitingand waiting.for somethingANYTHINGto happen at least with the main characters Jon Daenerys and Tyrion . With ' A Feast For Crows ' the holding pattern was n't nearly as excruciating for me . After the insanity and intensity of ' A Storm of Swords ' it was almost expected that there would be a little breather the calm after the storm and the calm before the next storm while Martin slowly put all his pieces into place.But after another thousand pages the story has slowed to a nearstandstill and I 'm beginning to wonder how necessary these last two novels were as the majority of events could probably have been covered with about a third of the page count without losing much substance . After page 500 or so in 'Dance ' the timeline moves beyond 'Feast 's ' timeline so I looked at the second half as sort of the first book of the second trilogy with 'Feast ' and the first half of 'Dance ' providing the bridge between the two and we all know how nonstop awesome the first trilogy was . In truth the second half was more of a slog for me than the first half the story crawling to the finish line a stark no pun intended contrast to previous entries in the series where the intensity would build and build culminating in a series of climaxes . But with 'Dance ' once the novelty of being back with my favorite characters for the first time in many years wore off so did my interest level.It 's not ALL bad however . Martin 's descriptive prowess remains in top form here . When he 's describing a scene it 's never difficult to picture what 's happening or what the setting looks like it all flows very well . It just takes Martin twice the page count these days to accomplish this . The chapters are also twice as long as earlier books but with less plot development and more descriptions of feasts everything eaten at the feasts and what clothes are being worn by the eaters of these feasts . Still Martin has a way of drawing the reader into his world and it was nice to catch up with my favorite characters and spend some time taking in the sights sounds and smells of Westeros and Essos . Martin excels at making you feel as if you 're actually there one of the main reason 's why I still consider 'Dance ' a pretty good read overall . He also develops the history and mythology of the world in more detail here giving it a slightly more epic feel which is definitely a plus.Also while I found most of the main characters ' storylines to be underwhelming although each had their moments the book truly shines with the secondary characters ' POV chapters particularly Reek 's Quentyn 's and Bran 's he seems somewhat of a secondary character now . These chapters were very wellwritten and infinitely more interesting and absorbing although one could debate just how necessary they are to the main story . I 'm split in that I love my epic fantasies to be EPIC with as much insight into the world as I can get but it 's beginning to seem as if Martin is losing control over the story that it 's becoming too unwieldy at least if he 's still planning on the series concluding with book 7 . Either way as good as these chapters were it was n't enough to put 'Dance ' even in the same ballpark as the first three . I 'd probably put it on the same level as 'Feast ' though I was more disappointed with this one as I was expecting so much more . Still if the final 2 books are anywhere near as good as the first three it all will have been worth it . There 's still time for Martin to turn things around if he can get off the side roads back alleys dirt roads and switchbacks that lead to nowhere and get back on the main highway . Here 's hoping he can pull it off . ",2
"This series has more plot twists and surprises then you can shake a stick at . Always keeps you interested and wanting more . ",3
"Great fifth book in the series ! ! I just wish I waited for this book to be included in a bundle pack . I hope G. R.R . Martin is writing another book in this series . I ca n't wait for the next installment . ",4
"What can be told about this one ? If you 're fan of the series go get it now ! Lots of surprises on it . ",4
"The 5th book in this series is as boring and a slog to read as was Book 4 . Enough already just get to the end so I can know who survives and who wins the war . Books 13 were well written and this is NOT a 10 book Harry Potter series . It has taken me to SKIMMING through 70 % of the book just to get to find out what is going on with the Character Cercei . The subplot for Tyrion and Jorah was UNNEEDED UNNECESSARY and should did not do anything to improve this book . George PLEASE if you read these reviews stop writing already and get to the end . If you do not mind paying for this book you could just read the last 4 chapters . I understand there is a Book 6 coming . At this point I will wait until the LAST book to buy another one . ",0
"Very pleased with the whole series.. the characters just keep getting better even the ones you love to hate . Ca n't wait for the next one although I know I 'll have to ",4
"One of the most interesting reads I 've had in years . The characters are so well developed that it & # 8217s hard not to fall hard for the characters . The TV series does the story well . ",4
"ADwD is in my opinion some of the best individual moments in the entire series tied together by the same kind of plodding character work and stalling that plagued AFfC . While many events could compete with the best moments of ASoS in excitement wowfactor an emotional pain there just were n't enough of them.The main three characters of the book are Jon Dany and Tyrion who spend most of there time politicking and sightseeing . If you have major enjoyment of worldbuilding without plot you will like this book . The book also includes many old POV 's and some new ones who only show up briefly but many of them have some exciting moments . Bran Arya and Cersei did great work for barely being around as did Davos . And one old character whose name I wo n't mention turned in some of the best chapters in the whole series.The major flaw of the book however is that it kept building to an epic climax that had to pushed back to the next book do to print length . While that may not be as annoying once the Winds of Winter finally comes out it it still a sin against this book . Hopefully the next book is fantastic . ",4
"I realize that books in the middle of a series must necessarily seem rather incomplete and that they must set up the concluding books but this was n't worth the wait.Martin is still 'hiding ' too much stuff while apparently attempting to set up his conclusion . At this point I am expecting the biggest deus ex machina since Philip Jose Farmer crapped up the ending of The Fabulous Riverboat series . It appears that Martin has somehow boxed himself in from whatever storyline he originally envisioned.The only thing that could save this for me at this point is a massive alien invasion that rescues the monsters of the Frozen North Beyond the Wall who turn out to be the descendants of stranded aliens from a crashed spaceship thousands of years ago . The Red God will then be revealed as an alien enemy of the stranded aliens who followed them and is trying to kill them all take over the world and raise humans as cattle.Seriously while Martin is fine writer most of the time this is too much . Wellwritten if you do n't give a hoot about plot characters or logic . I 'm done . I 'll not buy the next one . I may skim it at the library to see if Martin has found some sort of halfresolution . I 'm betting not . ",1
"This series should have been three good books but ended up five OK books . Seems author spread out the books to make money but watered down the story in doing so . Books 12 & 3 were good reads but 4 & 5 were the worst books that I have read in a long time . Wish I had n't read them and stopped at 3 . ",0
"I love this book and eagerly await the next oneI do n't want to give any spolers . Danny finally flies on one of her dragons though . ",4
"The continuation of the masterful epic by G.R.R . Martin . Best consumed after reading the proceeding books . Get the series and read it it works much better when you 're not having to wait for the next book ! ",3
"The seller I received this from was not honest in it 's condition but besides that it 's a GREAT book . If you are in love with this series books or show then of course you will love this book . I m taking my time reading it because the author likes to take his time in writing the next one of the series . Great Book ! ",4
"Amazing book . Be careful though George R.R . Martin will kill everyone you love ! George R.R . Martin does not use twitter because he killed all 140 characters ! ",4
"Love the series love the author and best of all I love that I could get it on my Kindle right away with no wait . ",4
"The last book 5 of Game of Thrones series was hard to put down . I enjoyed it very much . The only comment I have is the reader was left wondering what happened to some of the main characters . With all of the story lines available to the author I would love to see one more book to bring closure to some of these characters we can always hope . Jim Johnson ",4
"So many many storylines and not enough depth ! ! ! This was a great continuance but when you reach the end it lol eaves you burning ! A great ploy to be sure but George better get his pen in gear and finish this ! ",4
"I hear the TV series is popular but I do n't have HBO and the books are fabulous . I think I would rather read the book than watch a movie anyway . The plot is very complicated and character development is awesome . I 'll probably read it more than once . ",4
"I put off writing this review for a while . I could not make it through this book . This book and A Feast for Crows have convinced me that Martin has totally lost control of the plot of this series . There are far too many unresolved pointless plot lines and characters . At this point it seems that Martin is including random thoughts into the story without any consideration of how they advance the plot . I 've given up on this series and would not recommend it to anyone . Hard core fans will disagree but there are far better books to read . ",0
"Look at most 3star reviews and put that down as what I felt after reading Dance . Parts of this book are amazing but most of it is dull and it does nothing to move the story forward . Cliffhangers are fun for television shows and comics but not books that are 5+ years apart . The first three books were amazing in every way . They had major parts in them but still ended with you wanting more . Nothing ended with a cliffhanger until Feast came around . Dance is all cliffhangers and no resolutions or major events.I love GRRM and his work but Dance left me empty . Nothing was accomplished for any of the characters . The best stories in the book had nothing to do with everyone 's beloved Tyrion Dany Jon Arya . My favorites were Reek Davos Selmy and Bran . Unfortunately they did not get enough chapters in the book . Mostly you get Tyrion wandering around and acting like a dope Dany acting nothing like the Dragon she was in the first three books and Jon Snow wandering around the Wall wondering what to do.Some of the chapters are on par with the first three novels so it is not like GRRM lost his edge . Especially one Dany chapter and the epilogue which really rocked . And every Reek chapter was superb . So I hope GRRM 's Mereen knot if fully undone now and he can go back to working his magic ! ! ",2
"I 'm always amazed at the fertility of this guys mind . What a great story teller . I eagerly await each new book from him . ",4
"I am a fan of this series . As a matter of fact before purchasing this latest work I reread the entire series to get me back into the mood of the storyline . I have some points for those who find it 'boring ' or 'stumbling ' or 'too much'.First GRRM has NOT changed his style . He continues to grip you with an amazing tale granted a very long tale that has the most amazing and indepth character development I have ever seen . If you go back and reread the series you will find this DOES NOT CHANGE over the course of the story . What happens is that new characters are introduced and the tale becomes more complex.Second If you do n't want to read what is essentially and indepth and amazingly colorful history then do n't ! Sure this is entertainment yet it TRULY makes you think ! The author is forcing you to remember and figure out that these characters are all acting independently along the timeline . The depth of the story stories really is truly aweinspiring.Third GRRM is bold enough to piss off the reader by simply making things happen . Characters die ! Characters you LIKE DIE ! BAD things happen that you DO N'T want to happen . TOUGH ! It 's all a part of the story ! IF you do n't like that then write your own story where everything happens exactly the way YOU want it to ! I can not even count the number of times I have said to myself I never saw that coming ! This all feeds back into my first point ! The Character development is amazing ! In reality people change as they grow and experience life these characters change in the same manner ! It 's truly gripping ! Fourth No I do n't find this to be a 'ca n't put it down pageturner ' yet I found myself reading it every day . the story is gripping the characters are amazingly human and honestly believable . They do things you do n't expect not because the author wants to piss you off because they are very like real people ! In the end I find this series to be stunningly good . Continually . The biggest problem I have is I wish it would wrap up I think a lot of us feel that way . Yet I will continue to read as we hopefully get another installment.The story did move along many seem to feel it did n't move along enough for them again I say let the art flow . If you do n't like it stop reading it . The end of the book very much sets us up for the next one and completely changes the game again ! Sometimes I think he does this just to be annoying.Hope that helps.. ",3
"As one who was enchanted by the first three volumes of Martin 's saga I was extremely disappointed at Book 4 . But then Martin promised at the end that Book 4 was merely a setup for Book 5 which I bought with great anticipation . Historical fiction usually has the hero or heroes prevailing at the end . Apparently Martin does not like his heroes very much because he spent nearly two books on a litany of minor characters who frankly I could not keep straight from one chapter to the next . Whatever happened to Bran and the suggestion he was going to prevail in the end and bring the Stark House back to prominence ? Even Arya flashed great potential in the first three books her feisty attitude and grit made you pull hard for her . I was n't particularly fond of Sansa 's whiny little character but at least she was Lord Eddard and Lady Catelyn 's little lady . So where the heck were any of them in Books 4 and 5 ? They had cameo appearances while a roster of bit players took center stage . Only Jon Snow received his due but at the end of Book 5 even he was in turmoil . I 've heard rumors that Martin is writing Book 6 but I will have to be convinced before I spent any more money or time when the trend is clearly disappointment . ",2
"I just wanted to add my one star review because this book does n't deserve its three star rating . My wife was disgusted by the torture porn and I was as well not because I 'm a prude but because it was too graphic and totally unnecessary . It did n't add to the story at all.GRRM has taken a page out of Robert Jordan 's craft and is now turning his fans against him with endless discussion of food finery unnecessary descriptions of things that do n't matter and pissing off the end of things.I quit the book after 200 pages my wife quit after 150 . Like others we loved the first three books and the last two have been painful.How GRRM can repeat the mistake Robert Jordan made is beyond me . ",0
"This feels like a precursor to bigger events . I enjoyed reading about my favourite characters but it did n't feel like a whole lot happened . ",2
"I enjoyed this book as much as the others . Am sad to have to wait for the next one . If you liked his other books this one will not disappoint . ",4
"I wish I had just read the reviews and not bothered with the book . Many of them have somehow managed to compress 1000+ pages into 10 at the most . How is it possible that people have condensed it so much when Martin couldnt ? Clearly he needs to fire his editors . And maybe try and care about the story just a little.It seems that almost any reviewer here could do a better job than Martins.Maybe someone could write a 200 page condensed version where our fav chacters actually live . But I have had enough of this sh . Who could even be bothered ? Thats all i 'm left with now that the anger has faded . Apathy . ",0
"I loved Martin 's first three books but I doubt I will read another in this series . He is no Tolkien . I do n't mind a 1000 page book if it is interesting has a good plot and the characters are welldeveloped . However I feel that Martin thought he was being paid by the word ! This particular book is supposed to run parallel to book four . He admits that book four was running too long and that he split it . Well he should have taken one of the swords from the book to it . It gives you the feeling that he cut all the description or stuff he did n't like in book four and threw it into book 5 as an after thought . He keeps killing off old characters and creating new ones as well . This makes the book seem disjointed.I wound up skimming a great deal and forcing myself to read through to the ending . Only a few story lines were resolved in the book . I am really disappointed . ",0
"This is by far the richest series I 've ever read in the genre . Rich in characters rich in story line rich in drama and at times rich in laughs too ! And very rich in wit ! Kudos George R. R. Martin ! ",4
"I am ready for the others to be written now . I just hope I do n't forget what I have read in all the other ones by the time the last ones are published . ",4
"At the end of listening to A Feast for Crows one is greeted by the author seemingly responding to the slew of readers that finished the book and were dissapointed . He acknowledged that he left half of the main characters out in the book and would rectified this in the 5th novel A Dance With Dragons . Although we do get updates on some of our favorites characters Tyrion and Daenerys the majority of the novel watches these characters make little to no progress in their story arcs . Although this tendency for the nobility to sit by and basically do nothing hoping that their problems will go away may be realistic this is not something that a reader wants to read about for several hundred pages . He promised to progress the story forward but I feel he is crushed under the weight of the dozens of subplots he has made up . For the upcoming 6th novel he really needs to concentrate on the main characters Tyrion and Jaime Lannister Daenerys Tergaryen Petyr Baelish Stannis Baratheon Bran Stark and John Snow and move this novel towards some resolution . After two novels in a row with little progress I hope that he will prove himself worthy of the comparisons to Tolkien and write as strongly as he did in the first novel . ",1
"A wonderful book and only disappointing in the fact that I must wait another few years for the next installment . ",4
"Love it ! Ca n't wait for the sequel to come out because we are cliffhanging here ! George R.R . Martin has an incredible imagination and the ability to put it into words in an exciting jawdropping way that makes his tales so compelling they are hard to put down . A Dance with Dragons is full of angst warring brutality and unexpected twists and turns throughout . A fabulous read . His characters are thoroughly developed and whether you love them or hate them you will not forget them ! ",4
"Everything disintegrates in this one . The story is all over the place . Still it has more big moments than book four so I 'll give it four stars . ",3
"Men are men and women women no matter which side of the Wall we were born on . Good men and bad heroes and villains men of honor liars cravens bruteswe have plenty as do you.The scope of Martin 's world increases . The breadth of his characters grows by magnitudes . And the epic expands ever outwards.This book concludes little and alludes to a lot . It 's not as fulfilling in and of itself but Dance propels Martin 's worlds forward in large leaps.Tyrion is back and he was sorely missed in Feast for Crows . Jon Snow 's character evolves to put on a display of strength touched on in previous books but solidified in this tome . Like his previous novels each chapter comes from the perspective of a different character . While some we know Martin has the audacity to introduce even more characters to his historic rainbow of interconnected plots.Dance is as big and bold as the preceding novels . It 's dark heavy and written with a lusciously lavish hand like its four predecessors . I ca n't understand what readers do n't like about this one short of the fact that it does n't bring the stories to an end . But that 's the fun right ? ",4
"The last two books were just flat out plain old horrible . After reading the previous book and actually I 'd started this at the end of the that book with this book I had gotten unbelievably bored with the series and would read the first two pages of every chapter and if it did n't grip me i 'd skip to the next chapter I love my kindle and ability to quickly do that . You would think that this would lead me to ending up at chapters where I did n't know what was going on . Amazingly enough that never happened ! Apparently NOTHING happened in this book.. ",0
"This book is just as great as all the others . A page turner that will keep you up reading at night . ",4
"Well I am a fan too but I think except for some repetitive description of previous books he did tried to bring the story forward just not enough . I am worried that we are looking at another 4 to 5 books with the current progress . And George please stay healthy . We hope to see you finish the book . ",3
"This book has many surprises and makes you question why some things must happen . I guess the question who will finally take control of the Seven Kingdoms . What is the roll that the Dragon Queen truly play ? ",4
"Well now this book has generated some serious emotions on the lovehate Martin train . The honest truth is that you can only get worked up if you really care and that is the whole point.Martin creates a world that the reader becomes attached to and storylines that demand resolutions . This newest installation is ponderously large and there is a feeling at times that the story is not moving forward due to the majority being parallel to the previous novel . YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK AS AFFC PART2 Do that and you 'll be super happy . No matter what anyone says Martin write one hell of a story . ",3
"Wow ! Great book maybe my favorite so far . like always so much suspense and intrigue ! Ca n't wait for the next book . George r.r . Martin write write write ! ! ! ",4
"I have just finished this after reading books 14 . Seems I ca n't stop reading these books so addictive . I am also waiting eagerly for TV to catch up . ",4
"Utterly and completely blown away by this book . The series comes roaring back to life with rich characters amazing plot lines vivid images incredible twists and turns . George Martin is incredibly gifted . One of the best books I have ever read . One of the very best in the entire series . Pure genius Mr. Martin . I applaud you Ser ! ",4
"Yes not a lot happened other than the plot grew denser this story seems to be evolving in baby steps at this point . But guess what ? I loved & thoroughly enjoyed it anyway . Like a lot of folks I did n't wait half a dozen years for this book maybe that tempered my expectations I do n't know . I started reading A Song of Ice and Fire last summer after learning HBO was making it into a series . Was never a big fan of the fantasy genre but got sucked into this series from the first few chapters of AGOT.Hope the pay off 's a doozy Mr. Martin . With all this foreplay it better be . ",3
"I 'm not going to post a synopsis or anything nearing a spoiler as a lot of people have just been turned on to these books thanks to the HBO series . If you 're wondering how this book compares to the previous four in the series it 's good just maybe not quite as good at least early on . This book started off slower for me than the prior installments did . It 's chocked full of details just like it 's predecessors but lacking a little in the action department as compared to the prior books . I feel like this was done to set the scene for what 's to come because the farther you get into the book the better the story the faster the pace and a lot more action . We do get some new character perspectives in A Dance With Dragons as well as the ones that were so noticeably missing in A Feast For Crows . Martin was smart enough to try to get at least one chapter in for all of the major characters in this one I only noticed one that was missing entirely probably because so many complained about the lack of certain characters in A Feast For Crows . Are all of the questions we were left with from the previous book answered ? No but he does at least give us a little more to go on and of course he leaves us with more cliffhangers ! ! ! One in particular left me a little stunned and a bit upset . I 'll be very surprised if that story line ends the way we were led to believe . I do n't think it will but Martin has earned my respect by doing just this kind of thing so you never know . ",3
"This helps to keep up with the tv show . This is such escape and fantasy . I just love this book . ",4
"I know there 's a lot of complaints about the latest installment in the ASoIaF series but they are all minor . The book is superb . The writing is beautiful and just hearing about the characters feels magical.I love the book and even though I know it wo n't be for years ca n't wait for the next one . ",4
"Martin had prepared us to expect that this would be the final book in the series . This was where all those divergent story lines where drawn together . Instead what we got was a clumsy although at times entertaining restart . In many ways It feels as if Martin flush with the success of the HBO series decided that he wanted the series to go a bit further . So instead of ending the many stories he 's put out there he added new characters and put new plot lines in motion.A Dance With Dragons has everything that the other books had in terms of the quality of writing but it I 've started to wonder when does a Song of Ice and Fire end ? ",2
"Seriously . I find myself skimming over the chapters to 'get to the good parts ' . That tells me I 'm bored and after waiting for this book for so long it 's simply no longer entertaining . Dani is a waste of time and I had such high expectations of her . Tyrion has become the fool he so desparately is n't and I do n't give a crap about all the minor houses that seem to take up a great chunk of the pages and the story . Jon has been the only saving grace but I 'm afraid even that 's wearing thin . This book is so sadly disappointing . Like a party you 've looked forward to for weeks and weeks and it turns out to be a big blah.ADDED Aug 1st . SPOILER REALLY ? ! ? ! ? ! Jon is dead ? WTF ? Could n't you have killed off Dani ? Cersi ? But JON ? ! ? ! Was this bastard so like his father that it was his honor and steadfast hold on doing what 's right that got him killed too ? Aaarrrggggghhhh ! ",1
"I truly love the first three books of this series although I 'm normally not a fantasy fan . This book is just not up to the standards of the other four . Mr Martin is an accomplished and imaginative storyteller but you would n't know it from this book . The numerous plot lines plod slowly but mostly uninterestingly along seemingly not really going anywhere or at least nowhere I cared to follow . And the endless number of very minor minor semiimportant possibly important temporarily important important and very important characters are always difficult to keep straight without Mr. Martin 's use of coy chapter titles . The Discarded Knight The Braless Khaleesi The Hirsute Lovelorn Humbert Humbert Knight ok those may not be accurate serve no purpose other than to further confuse a series already in need of its own card catalogue . The main characters veer so wildly from their previous personalities as to be almost recognizable . Tyrion easily the most practical and thoughtful of characters wanders sullenly about unfamiliar lands taking little or no part in his own story and contributing so little to the story that he could have been left out entirely . The normally fiery little LolitaMadonna of Dragons has gone from a worldconqueror with her eyes fixed firmly on her stolen throne to an indecisive teenager sighing over a sellsword 's gold partial and too stupid to think of putting a cushion on a bench when her butt hurts . A whole lot of nothing is going on here and I mean a LOT this book is massive . The worst part of all is that the general feeling I took from the book is that Martin was bored with the story and the characters and just churning out a filler to appease his editors and fans . Read the other four books especially the first three . For this tome I 'd recommend the Cliff Notes . ",2
"Great read also a long read . I was surprised when some of my favorite characters died . There are plenty or the original characters still left to make the next book be very engrossing . The switching back and forth between winter and summer locales keeps you interested in each wouldbe KingQueen as the game of thrones continues . Dragons are found to be very difficult with which to dance.If you liked the other books in the series you 'll like this one too ! ",4
"Having read the entire series I have quite the lovehate relationship with George R.R.Martin . I enjoy these books and many of the characters . He is a very good storyteller.However it is his cliche to kill most of those who are goodand any cliche is a bad idea . This book is no different and also suffers somewhat from the author 's lack of focus and editing.Although not as dragging as the last book I still found myself skipping large portions of pointless text usually descriptions of meals landscape clothing etc . to get back to what was interesting and important.NEWS FLASH If you have n't sold your universe by the end of book 2 you are n't doing it right.Overall it was a solid enjoyable read . Some parts had me literally not wanting to put my Kindle down . If you 've slogged through the entire series you will probably enjoy this one . ",3
"It is really hard to be able to write this many books so many pages each and still keep a good story going . I have read all five and it is really hard to wait for 3 more years . I 'll have to keep living to finish the story ! ! ! ! ! LOL ",4
"Like a great game of cyvasse George R.R . Martin is yet again arranging his key players for another epic showdown in Westerosand beyond . Sellswords plague dragons OH MY ! In A Dance With Dragons the key elements are set forth for the tensions that will be necessary to bring about further wars across the Seven Kingdoms and beyond . Martin 's writing always flows beautifully though this time around the plot is a bit slower than previous editions think more the speed of its predecessor A Feast For Crows . But that 's okay we 've come to know that when it comes to George R.R . Martin the very best explosions of chaos come to those who wait ! ",3
"I loved these and ca n't wait for the next one . I need to know what happens next ! Love this series . ",4
"I do n't usually like this kind of book . I 'm a bit snooty I guess . But someone whose taste I trust advised me to try the series and I became hooked . Start with Book I and you 'll probably go through the whole lot though the last one Book VI is not out yet . And there are a lot of us waiting for it to come out . The research that Martin has done is stunning as well . ",4
"Enjoyed the tv series and wanted to read the book for more . Wow ! You get more ! The price was good and shipping great . ",4
"Lots of characters that do n't add much to the story . I enjoy the world created but Martin can spend whole chapters on history and origin that can be skimmed . I like the overall story and am looking forward to reading more about the game of thrones . ",2
"What can I say about Book 5 of ASOIAF that has n't already been written about obsessively ad nauseum on blogs everywhere ? This book for me was a 'setup ' book that may allow Book 6 to really jump off . I 'm still waiting for a book that will live up to the incredible magic that was Book 3 but that 's a pretty high bar to set . But let 's face it if you 've already read over 4000 pages you 're not going to stop at Book 5 . Buy it and escape to Essos across the narrow sea ! ",4
"This happens to be just as good as A Storm Of Swords and beats A Feast by a long mile . I 'm a little upset at the negative reviews that I 'm seeing and am wondering if its just that people are upset that Martin took so long to write it or that the pace needs to be faster or something along those lines . A lot of people fail to grasp that its still in the middle where things are n't lightening quick but picking up speed from the fourth book . I have to confess that I 'm not completely done but am more than two thirds done and I 've had to pull myself away from it so I do n't finish it too fast . Anyway I highly recommend this wonderful book and ca n't wait till the next one comes out ! ",4
"A little long a bit windy I sorted expected better considering the time it took to write it . But it does help answer a few more questions ",2
"I do n't remember who to thank for introducing me to the Ice and Fire series . Once I open the book I hate to put it down . Unfortunately I am a slow reader . Great characters great story line . I was very surprised to love it . I usually hate mediveal settings but this one works for me . I usually hate books with too many characters because they are confusing and most authors have problems properly developing a single character much less multiple characters . How Mr. Martin keeps all these plates in the air is fascinating . ",4
"Do I even need to say how long it 's been ? A Feast for Crows was a placeholder a holding action intended to keep the story going just a little during the decadelong creative struggle George R.R . Martin faced at the end of A Storm of Swords . It would be easy enough to set aside any objective criticism and instantly adore the book . But that 's not how I am as a reader and as grateful as I am for A Dance with Dragons it 's not as satisfying as A Storm of Swords A Game of Thrones or A Clash of Kings . This is not to say that it 's a bad book anything but . It is at turns thrilling and terrifying a big complicated behemoth of a book full of unexpected surprises and deftly paidoff moments of plot . But there is trouble at the heart of it the fabled Meereenese Knot that Martin grappled with for so long.Before I continue I want to note that I am going to avoid spoilers and speak in generalities . I understand that those generalities may be considered spoilers so read on at your own peril . But please be aware that I will not spoil specific plot twists character reveals etc.A Dance with Dragons is centered around three major storylines Dany 's rule in Meereen as well as the many people trying to reach her Jon 's tenure as Lord Commander of the Knight 's Watch on the Wall and the north under the stewardship of the Boltons . Other characters and settings are addressed including a few lingering threads spun out of A Feast for Crows but Dany and Jon are by far the most critical characters in the book.The problem is that the Meereenese Knot is n't so much a knot as it is a culdesac . For five books now we 've watched Dany develop as a queen waiting for her to arrive on the shores of Westeros with her dragons and her army . And yet at the close of A Storm of Swords Dany decided to stay in newlyconquered Meereen on the shores of Slaver 's Bay to learn how to rule . Her arc is concerned mostly with that as well as the unexpected consequences of her decisions . The early chapters in the arc are some of the least interesting in the entire book but Dany 's arc begins to pick up steam in the last third of A Dance with Dragons driven in large part by a compelling new POV character . Yet as the book closes I 'm not sure that I 'd say the knot is any looser than where it began . Only Martin knows for sure but with so much time devoted to Dany I 'm not sure very much progress has been made.Jon 's arc on the Wall also deals with the complications of rule the compromises leaders must make for the greater good . And as Jon makes some very difficult decisions it 's easy to wonder if he has some of his Ned Stark 's weaknesses or if he will rise above his father 's mistakes . One could also say that Jon 's arc has certain Shakespearean overtones.The Boltons are I believe the only true villains in the series characters so vile and evil that they are irredeemable . Yet they are believable villains a family of sociopaths who pass on their predatory approach from father to son . Their story is told from a surprising POV character who I would rather not name and I found the Bolton chapters to be especially compelling as well as disturbing.The remaining characters and arcs in the story are probably best left unmentioned although they often eclipse the three major plot movements of the book and lay important pieces for books to come . I will say that I have gone from being lukewarm about Victarion Greyjoy to wanting to hop aboard a longship and follow him across the world the guy is an incomparable badass reckless and bold a true pirate lord . My old favorite Davos Seaworth is on hand for a few chapters and remains one of the most humble and truly brave and heroic characters in A Song of Ice and Fire . But my favorite POV chapters come from a completely new character one who shepherds in a whole series of changes into the series.Although A Dance with Dragons is a much more engaging book than A Feast for Crows I believe many readers will find that it shares many of the unsatisfying elements that plagued its immediate predecessor . Playing pieces are shuffled into position or out of position but very little is resolved . This is not surprising for a series as big and ambitious as A Song of Ice and Fire but with such a long gap between books it can be disappointing . Unlike earlier volumes in the series A Dance with Dragons does not tell a complete story it is more complete than A Feast for Crows but only just so.Here 's hoping for a shorter wait before the release of Winds of Winter .

"It felt like George is a bit bummed out with this book and his own series . It feels like he does not know which way it is going and he is wandering around lost in his world of Westeros . This is not a happy time in the series . The reality of the difficult situations the characters are in is hitting home to some of them . The prose felt like it was forced and rushed to get to the publisher to meet a deadline . Because of this it felt like a formula was taking place in the book much like a Duke 's of Hazard TV show . There will be a car chase in the first five minutes Boss Hogg with try a new plot to get them Duke boys . So it is in this book . New characters will come and old and new characters will be killed off . Yawn . Me thinks the plot moves too slow right now . The characters are stuck in quicksand because the author is mired in his own creation . So yuck . This is a read once only book unlike some of the earlier books in the series . ",2
"Game of thrones book dance of dragons is fifth and it shows while the story line is great the text is long winded and it shows that . The author is getting tire of telling the store . I waited till this book came out before beginning with the first book . And the title and release date had been released but the date came and went two times two years and now we have yet a new release date that will he will miss too . I feel cheated do not start reading . I want my money back ",3
"I have basically dedicated my spare time over the past two months to devour all five books of the Game of Thrones series and like many of the other readers I LOVED the first three . Number four left me with a few complaints but luckily I could jump right into Dance with Dragons . I can understand the complaints of many of the reviewers but I don ` t agree . This is still a fancinating world even if the characters don ` t move as I wish they would . At some point during Dance I realized this series is truly about playing the Game of Thrones and not about winning it . At every turn your favorite hero is struck down but then so is the most despicable villian . We despise the Lannisters but then almost start to root for them as the previous history is revealed so covertlybut only for a moment because then they disgust you all over again with their lack of character . And while There was never a more honorable man then Ned Stark it seems like his family will never be reunited . And what is Jon Snow 's true parentage anyway ? He is a bastard we all know but who 's bastard ? Some part of me feels he is a stark by another parent than his father and maybe Rhaegar is his father . I love the way so many stories are going on and I will not give up on this series . I can not see where it is going next but that is how the best stories are told ? In fact this series reminds me of LOST . I have faith that the creater of this world will not disapoint me and even if he does it was an entertaining ride . ",2
"Excellent story and intrigue ! What is going to happen next is anybody 's guess ! Since I have to wait a year for book 6 I think I will read book 5 again ! ",4
"I love the fire and ice series . Ca n't get enough . I am VERY upset that I have to wait so long for the next book . ",4
"These books are great especially on the kindle . They were so easy to read I could not put them down . ",4
"Along with the rest of the world I am eagerly awaiting the next book ! It was great to highlight some of the older characters . Hoping for a great Arya portion next time ",3
"I went to bed early well early for me determined to get a good night 's rest . It was n't to be I could n't sleep with the almost finished A Dance with Dragons sitting in my living room . I dozed a little and my thoughts bounced around from Bran to Jon to Tyrion and Quentyn . I thought about what it would be like to live through a winter that lasts years instead of months which started me thinking about the logistics of even a year long winter . How would I and everyone around me store enough food to last through a lost growing season ? Finally at 2am I gave up and crept out to my living room to read.I promised myself just a chapter or two until I started to feel drowsy and then I 'd head straight back to bed . George R. R. Martin I ca n't resist you ! Unlike A Feast for Crows this marks a return of several fan favorite characters I was most concerned with Jon Snow and his brothers in black on the wall so for me practically from the start this book is amazing ! Martin does n't keep things to himself there is a lot of meat to this story but there is also a ton of backstory something I usually hate but with Martin his conversational style of writing keeps the reader firmly along for the ride wherever it may take them.But this does lead me to my first criticism too much is just too much . Just like last time new characters have been added and sadly I do n't think they add a whole lot to the story . In Feast Davos story in my opinion was pretty unnecessary in this book I 'd add Quentyn Martell prince of Dorne . While his story is compelling and makes for some interesting situations I do n't see it adding that much to the overall storyline or to other characters in the book namely Daenerys Targaryen.Which brings me to the situations that my favoritest characters are now in which I think mostly is best summed up by quotes from the characters themselves.Here there be spoilersYou 've been warned ! Jon Snow is in a difficult position as Commander of the Night 's Watch which was pretty badly decimated after a battle with Mance Rayder the King Behind the Wall . Just who do you imagine that you are ? Stannis Baratheon asks Jon . The watcher on the walls . The sword in the darkness he replies and this pretty much sums up the crap on a cracker that he is dealing with . But Jon is smart and determined not to fail in this the most important of duties and so holds his ground against anyone who 'd try to stop him . Which inevietably leads to friction and resentment most notably with Janos Slynt.Janos Slynt executioner and all around yuck guy is now in the Night 's watch and he is clearly out to get Jon Snow 'bastard son of the traitor Eddard Stark and an abomination . ' Well karma is a bitch and Janos gets whats coming to him and darn if I did n't jump up and down with excitement . He really was a nasty freak.Tyrion is more contemplative and sadly noseless you 'll have to reread parts of the old books to find out why I 'd forgotten this bit . Gone is the flippant schemer that we all love and in his place Tyrion seems a bit tired drunk does he ever drink anything BESIDES wine ? and sad . His murder of his father while a memory he clearly cherishes is also a burden for him he is the kinslayer . Cersei has offered a bounty for his head and he is on the run without money a first for him . He has finally become what the people around him always saw a useless halfman who mutters his father 's last words over and over again 'where do whores go ? Daenerys seems a bit muted . She is a dragon queen conquerer and yet she for most of the book wavers over decisions almost to the point where the reader wants to jump into the book and shake her . This is strange behavior indeed for Daenerys who has always struck me as a strong and forthright person who never hesitates and is always focused on her ultimate goal the throne of Westeros.Oddly after all my yearning for Jon and Dani it 's Bran 's story that most captured my interest this time . His odd little band of survivors was on a quest and every time the story switched to another character I was tempted to skip forward to read Bran again.I think a lot of people will complain that the story is too long that not every little detail needs to be discussed and worried overthey 'd be right but then again there was never a dull moment and I have to wonder if I 'd like this series so much if Martin was a briefer writer . Something else to think about are the volumes of characters I had to look some up because I could n't remember who they were Varys Shae the brother and sister with Bran . There are sooooo many people I needed a book to keep this book straight . ",4
"I agree with much of the criticism that relays that by this stage of the game things should be picking up . There are enough characters and side plots already in this story line without introducing more . That being said I will stick it out with this series to see where the author will take it . I am a firm believer in the idea of the creator of a story is wholly accountable and responsible for how it turns out for good or bad . It is a product of an individual 's endeavors and we as consumers are along for the ride . This latest book is long winded and actually boring in part totally unlike the first 3 or 4 . ",2
"Excellent as usual from Mr. Martin . This is one of the few kindle books I have paid full price for 14.99 and every penny was worth it ! This book continues the stories of the characters we all love or love to hate . Great book . ",4
"Where is # 6 ? Ca n't come fast enough ! The storyline just keeps getting better and worse at the same time . Stop killing off my favorite characters ! ",4
"Too many characters too many pages too much of nothing ! The first three titles in the series were outstanding . A combination of books four and five minus at least a half dozen characters and some serious editing would have made one good novel . One can only hope that Martin will read the negative reviews pick up the pace of the plot and drop all the superfluous material in the next Song of Ice and Fire book . ",1
"This is a great book for adult men or woman that can handle rape and alot of cruelty . Other than that it is awsome in so many ways it is hard to describe you will not want to stop reading once you start . ",4
"I enjoy Mr. Martin 's writing but by the fifth book I am beginning to feel as though he recycles the same things over and over just adds a host of new names and symbols . Every mountain and every valley seems to produce a whole new crowd of names and peoples that makes his world very crowded . He still manages to surprise and he still keeps me turning the pages . I will definitely buy the next book in the series . ",3
"This book is overlong and boring . I liked the first three books I finished the third a week before this book was published and put off reading the fourth because I wanted to go ahead and read the fifthI heard books 4 and 5 take place relatively at the same time just with different characters . I eventually read and liked the fourth.EditI originally gave this one star but I think it had more to do with me than the book . Sure it 's way too long considering not much happens . I hate spending so much time on one book . By the time I finished I was angry . Nearly two years later I do n't hate it as much . I 'm about to reread the series . Maybe when I get to this book I 'll like it more . ",2
"After reading Martin 's A Feast for Crows I wrote to a friend who also was reading the Song of Ice and Fire series and suggested I might not read the next volume . I told her that when I started the series I wondered where Martin was going . After Crows I wondered Is he going anywhere ? But having invested a lot of time in the first four books i decided to give A Dance With Dragons a try . I 'm glad I did . I still do n't know where Martin is going but the journey 's become more interesting.I started reading the series while HBO was advertising in advance of A Game of Thrones . The more I read of Martin the more I 'm convinced HBO was the only choice to produce these books with violence and sex galore . Most specifically like HBO 's The Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire Martin has no compunction about killing off major characters early and often . When I began A Game of Thrones I thought the story was about Ned Stark . I was wrong . Robb Stark ? Wrong again . The two bastards Jon Stark and Tyrion Lannister ? Does n't look like it . Maybe it 's Anya and Bran 's story . Or Daenerys . Who knows.Sometimes I think Martin 's paid by the word . Not because his stories are so long but because of the many diversions he takes to different cities introducing new characters some who advance the plot and many who do n't . We get a full look at the cultures of these cities religions customs dress hairstyles coins favorite foods . All interesting enough but sometimes I mentally scream Get on with it ! But Martin does write stirring set pieces such as the procession of the northmen through the Wall the release of the dragons and Cersei 's repentance . It 's these largescale scenes and the fates of the remaining major characters that keep me going . Who is the story about ? I hope we 'll eventually find out . ",3
"I wish I had been warned before starting this series that Martin still has two books to write yet . I have been going crazy waiting for book 6 to be published . I recommend waiting a few years before starting this series . ",4
"This book may be a little slower than the others but the story line keeps progressing and I 'm hooked . ",4
"Out of the Song of Ice and Fire seriesthis one definitely isnt the best . Its still very well written and descriptive but not catch my breath amazing like the others ! Still Cant wait for book 6 though ! ",2
"These books are amazing ! So far the 3rd installment is my favorite but I still love every single one and hope that there are many more to come ! ",3
"Despite the widely varying opinions on the book I think the 3 stars the reviews have settled on gets it right . All those complaints about a lack of resolution ? They 're dead on . Dance with Dragons is well written and enjoyable but I did feel let down by it.It 's not that I or I suspect the other readers who 've voiced similar complaints expected all of our questions answered but a book that devotes so much time to characters going to a particular location Mereen and talking about the cool stuff that 's gon na happen when they get there should n't end with those same characters still traveling and talking about what will happen whenThat 's why people say nothing happens in this book . It creates the expectation that Victarion Greyjoy remember him from book 4 ? will get to Mereen and encounter Daenerys . Never happens . Victarion is still sailing by the end 959 pages later . If the first book in the series A Game of Thrones moved at this pace Ned Stark would never have arrived at Kings Landing.Some of the best chapters in ADWD involve characters who get the least page time like Arya Bran Sersei and Theon . Having Bran go from an equally important character to a 3chapter afterthought was particularly frustrating as he actually got where he was going and where he goes is COOL . Cersei still does n't have her trial unfortunately but her few scenes are compelling.There are 13 Tyrion chapters in ADWD and for all his amusing adventures none of it moves the plot forward significantly and by the end he 's doing the same thing he was at the beginning.John 's story also 13 chapters feels even less eventful . When something finally does happen it comes out of the blue and it 's over and done in less than half a page.The third most featured character Daenerys spends much of the book caught up in bureaucratic wrangling . Ugh . Hope you paid attention to all the names of the different sword companies and their leaders from ASOS . There will be a test . It 's called A Dance with Dragons.HOWEVER all these criticisms did n't put me off continuing to read the series . I still love it and I eagerly await the next installment.AlthoughI just watched George R. R. Martin on youtube reading an excerpt from the asyetunfinished 6th book . It was a Victarion chapter . He 's still on his boat doing the same sorts of things he did in the last book talking about what he was gon na do when he gets where he 's going . It did n't inspire confidence . ",2
"Martin has created a vast and colorful tapestry so I do n't mind conceding action for some deepdive plot development . This would have been easier to digest if it had n't taken 5 years to get cooked up I 'd forgotten all but the Alist characters . I just hope the remaining books come out faster and that the thousands of pages have been worth it . I 'd like to give it 0 stars for taking 5 years to write but that would n't be fair to the book ! ",3
"The book is decent not great lots of reviews on that point . My point prepare yourself for someone else to finish this series in about 15 years . In 2005 when book 4 came out the news from Martin was that he had written a monster tomb of 1600 pages that he decided to be split into 2 books . He published the first half covering roughly half the characters and the other half was supposed to be right behind . Well either that was a lie or the last half was garbage and had to be rewritten because it was 6 more years before the other half of an already written book was published . And if it was true that Martin had completed 800 pages of this book six years ago what exactly was he doing the last six years ? Note I do n't begrudge him fame fortune or retirementMartin is 62 and his devotion to this work has flagged badly . He is following the Robert Jordan model of plodding books but at a glacial oneeveryfiveyears pace . If he manages volume six in the next six years he will be 68 . Does anyone think he will finish the planned final seventh volume another six years later at 74 ? Of course not.So read this one or start the series fresh if you have never read any just do n't expect to read a conclusion written by GRRM . And if the Wheel of Time series is any indicationperhaps the replacement offer will at least pick up the pace.My vote GRRM should find a successor to finish the last two volumes in short order . Give him some plot line and editorial discretion and get these last two done . ",3
"I have enjoyed all the books and especially this one . I like Arya 's growth toward what she is going to be and Dani 's path toward gaining controltrustrespect of Dagon . Looking forward to the next book like so many other people ! ",4
"I 've had the benefit of reading the first five books in this series over the last year or so . I ca n't believe haw hard it would be to keep up with the story if you had been at it over the last decade and a half ! Splitting the story in half for books four and five has been interesting but I would have much preferred the story kept in chronological order . I spent way to much time worrying about what was going on with the lost characters in book four and too much effort trying to tie the timeline together in book five . It will be comforting to have everyone back together again for book six that is if any characters actually survive that long ? This is a grand story and an engrossing story to follow . I hope Mr Martin does n't keep us waiting too long for the conclusion ! ",3
"I loved this book it left me wanting to read more . Great writing amazing stories . Hope the next book comes out soon ",4
"I 'm done . Jumpy lumpy dumpy dull . All characters blur and bore me now . I give up on the series . Characters now no different from each other.As useless as the Third book in Titus Groan . Gormenghastly . ",0
"The first three books of Game of Thrones were wonderful compelling addictive reads . Unfortunately the momentum they 've built up is now being lost as the saga is now drifting into a lethargy and is quickly becoming As the World Turns of the fantasy genre . There are over a thousand pages but little ground has been covered.Seven books and now it looks like it 'll be eight are a lot of books to devote to petty family squabbles and power plays and Martin 's promise of dark and sinister forces have yet to materialize . ",2
"I read review after review of this book and because of those reviews was reluctant to buy Dance of Dragons . As soon as I finished book 4 though I could n't NOT get book 5 . I 'm midway through the book and I 'm flying through it . Pieces are starting to fall into place loose ends are coming together and the story is as engaging now as it was in book 1 . Sure new characters are introduced into an already huge cast of characters but they 're bridging the gaps between Westeros and Dany . I 'm very glad I bought this book ! ",3
"this is definitely my least favorite out of the series . well except maybe I liked it better than the last one . ca n't wait for the next book though . x ",2
"This book was slow to start for me and it took me awhile th o get into it . I know that there is another book for questions to be answered but I felt that there were too many . ",2
"Great reading as per the series . Good to get back to Danerys etc . I 'm just anxious for the series ' COMPLETION ! ! ",3
"The plots moved along in a way they had n't in the last book . I still get bogged down with new characters but I liked that he kept with a few of the main ones . ",3
"I did n't like the way the last two books were split but there were many things in this book that answered lingering questions . My biggest problem with the book it there are still too many things left hanging and I have n't seen anything that tells when next installment will be released . ",3
"Great start to the final book . Reminds readers and viewers of what has happened and provides updates in preparation for that extremely intriguing conclusion . I so look forward to that resolution of this series . ",1
"I 'll never understand how an author can create a whole world and write thousands of pages while keeping it fresh and revealing new things all along the journey but Mr. Martin does it well . I am looking forward to book 6 in the series . ",4
"I want to start off by saying that i thoroughly enjoyed the first 4 booksyes i said 4 in the series . With that being said I want to say that this book did not remotely feel like one of Martin 's books . I think that other readers will agree with me when I say that this book did not even feel like the previous 4 novels . ADWD disappointed me in the fact that it did not even have the Martinesque feel that the previous novels had . 2.5 stars but not deserving of the curve . ",1
"The unexpected twists in the plot kept my interest throughout and makes me want to start the next book before I read other books I have already purchased . ",3
"As with the first four novels this maintains an excellent style . Ca n't wait for the last two . The characters continue to grow and the plot thickens with every chapter . the dramatisation of this on television has added to the lure . ",4
"I got hooked on these books from the start and finally had to order the whole set . I finished this last book and ca n't wait for the next book . The price was right and the book came in in a very short time . Good quality and will order again . ",4
"To be concise I love the series . I 've read a lot of fantasy and Science Fiction series over the years . This is n't the best or most enjoyable . But I 'm waiting on book 6 and 7 and will buy them . The writers imagination and created world is genius . The Characters are enticing interesting and often complex . But All Men Must Die . And that is the problem . Every character you love or hate dies . Once you get invested in them a knife arrow or axe finishes the relationship . Even bad guys you love to hate die quickly . As you sift through five thick volumns of books you feel a deep hopeless loss . I 'm at the point of realizing I 'm addicted smoking more but enjoying it less . How is George Martin going to sew all the characters and subplots into a satisfying conclusion ? He 's not . He ca n't . Most of the plot problems will die or be killed off . This is not a fantasy series but a television series that will continue as long as the ratings and sales continue . We 're watching a fantasy world called a Game of Thrones not reading a novel a story with plot a satisfying adventure series . I believe George Martin has begun building more house than he can finish . If he pulls this off he is Genius . If not he was an opportunist . All Men Must Die . ",3
"Would of liked to see some of the characters from previous books but still it was a good read.Looking forward to the next book . ",3
"A few months ago when I started this series I was sure this set would be something I wanted on my bookshelves . Game of Thrones was definitely a five star book in my opinion but the books have been slowly deteriorating A Feast for the Crows was decent but A Dance with Dragons has been such a slow read.There are too many points of view I feel detached from most of the characters because there are so many I am also a little paranoid to get too attached to any character I feel like the author could kill them off at any moment.Okay now I just want to rant . I thought all of Westeros would have had to come together by now to battle the Others or Whites or whatever the boogeyman in the north is . Is that going to be the eventual progression ? Honestly I think that with how slow the author has become about putting the books out he will be dead before anything interesting actually happens . I mean how many years did it take to put out this book like 5 . I just do n't want to invest more time if the next book is going to come out in another 5 years and NOTHING will happen ! Did anyone else feel like George must have been hungry or eating himself as he wrote this there seemed to be a lot of discussion about food in this book . ",0
"I have been reading George RR Martin since the midnineties and consider A Song of Ice and Fire to be a work of genius . That said Dance is my least favorite of the books so far even though I have insider info on what will happen to Jon . Cackle . We all know how cavalierly he kills off beloved characters but this book was a bit over the top for me . But of course I am waiting anxiously for the next book . . . . ",4
"Before reading this I thought that George R.R . Martin depending on the conclusion of the series could in fact be compared to Tolkien . After reading this George Lucas 's handling of the Star Wars saga is a better comparison . In fact that comparison does a complete discredit to Lucas 's handling and continual tinkering of the Star Wars saga.I purchased the kindle edition at midnight the night it was released and it has taken me this long to force my way through it . I can only take so much before I become so frustrated with his handling of the characters and saga or completely bored in his story telling that I have to give it up for a few weeks before getting the stamina to pick it up again . In the end not much happens . It is a feat in itself to write 1000 pages where nothing really happens . Characters that were interesting become trite boring and two dimensional . The new POV 's are completely disinteresting and abruptly stop any momentum the book begins to build . After reading this I free I need to make an apology to all of the people over years I told had to read this series.What is the biggest problem with this series ? It is apparent that George does n't have any idea where it is going ! If you have n't read the New Yorker article that came out about a half a year ago about George R.R . Martin and the series do so . After reading that article attending a talkbook release for Dance with Dragons and considering the time line of releases it is clear he does n't know where the story is going . My wife who has n't read any of the books but read the article and attending the talkbook release came to the same conclusion . Consider this in 5 years he released the first 3 books which were incredible . It then took him 10 years to release the next 2 . It was n't because he was getting them just right it is because he has no idea what to right . He threw away about 300400 pages from Dance and Dragons and redid it.This is evident in his POV 's . George has written many primary characters into a dead end . He takes them to a location which has no more story or decides the main action should be taking place somewhere else so those other characters basically get abandoned . Where is Sam and Sansa ? Jaime has 1 chapter in 1000 pages while Cersei and Arya each have 2 . There is really no need for any of the new POV 's George just needs to figure out his story for the remaining of the saga and make sure his characters are in the right place . George wrote about 150 pages of which are essentially the misadventures of Tyrion . He could have done it in 10 pages . It should have been Tyrion takes a boat to Meereen . The boat gets hit by a storm . Another ship picks up the survivors as slaves which also has Mormont on board and the both get sold outside Meereen . I just saved 140 pointless pages . What about Griff then who cares about Griff.Midway through this book I thought that perhaps HBO by combining Feast and Dance and then using artistic freedom could perhaps salvage this saga but now being at the end I think it is hopeless . I could care less about any further books in the story nor the HBO series . If I 'm HBO I 'd be worried . If they attempt to follow these last 2 book no one will be watching the show by the end of the fifth season . It would take a heck of a turn around to redeem the series . At this point I 'm rooting for the Others to infest all lands and kill every character . ",0
"I love this book . Not as good as A Storm of Swords wide and away seen as the best in the series so far or even potentially A Clash of Kings but still an awesome book . The book has some high points but feels more like a setup book than the first three books . Definitely an improvement over A Feast for Crows also a setup book but this book does it MUCH better . Basically the 4th and 5th books are setup for the 6th and 7th books but A Dance with Dragons does the setup in a great way.I can completely understand why fans are divided over this book but still I think this book is awesome and would recommend it to anyone !

"I was really looking forward to this book wow was I disappointed . Absolutely nothing was accomplished and the story remained stalled . At this pace the rest of the story will fill another 5 books..at least . ",1
"I put off reading this book for a long time as I got so sick of waiting for GRRM to crank any work out . When I finally broke down and bought this I was reminded why I thought he was such a great author in the first place . I still sadly think he wo n't live to finish the series but it 's been a great ride so far ! ",4
"I was immediately dissatisfied with the end of A Dance With Dragons . As the story ratcheted up the intensity as events loomed ever larger on the horizon I began to notice that there was n't much of the book left . When it was over it was all I could do not to scream . Six years of waiting for this ? Some characters have n't been seen in ten years and their return is like this ? What is Martin doing ? The Meereenese knot was this ? There 's more to it than that initial visceral reaction of course . A Song of Ice and Fire was originally envisioned as a trilogy as most fans know and the tail end of the saga has gotten longer and longer with time . Currently a proposed septology which would fit well with the importance of the number seven in the world of Westeros and Essos A Dance With Dragons signals the end of the story 's transition from the blistering action of the first three books moving the pieces into position for the home stretch . Martin mentions the fictional game cyvasse time and again in ADWD and it 's clear that this board game which seems similar to chess a hobby of Martin 's so much so that he 's written at least one short story about the game is an allegory for the story he 's telling here . Hidden strategies and plotlines come to the front and while he keeps many a mystery shrouded with a few extra for good measure he also continues to grow the struggle for power in Westeros . The scope of the point of view characters widens including one old character which was fascinating to finally read the story through.The book is quite long and for such a lengthy tome it seems like the plot does n't always move very briskly but the quality of the writing is generally on par with the series at large . Martin 's very detailed description of the foods architecture and heraldry of the world of Westeros and Essos is never brief but it also draws a complete picture of the story being told.My big issue with this book is what is n't included . It feels about 100 pages shy of a proper conclusion because even in a story like this told in large chunks there should be some sense of the end of certain events with more to come . Both George and his editor have confirmed that some rather momentous events were removed from the end of the book moved to the beginning of the Winds of Winter and while it will certainly keep that next book moving smartly it also leaves the end of A Dance With Dragons wanting . There 's a rumbling volcano of a plot here but the book is over right before it erupts.A large complaint within the fan community is that they had formulated their own ideas about what would happen here . While I found one character 's journey to be frustrating at times to read through with less progress than I 'd hoped for by the final page the story is Martin 's to tell not mine to forecast and then be disappointed by . It is the height of hubris to decide what one wanted to see and then excoriate the author for not delivering on one 's own personal predictions . If Martin has done one thing well with his series it is defy the expectations of his readers keeping them guessing and and occasionally stunned by events as they play out.I am probably the biggest fan of A Feast For Crows I know of I loved its tour of a shattered broken realm as seen through the eyes of the smallfolk . The story felt fairly contained and focused even as it moseyed through Westeros . The story in A Dance With Dragons defines sprawling spanning the entire world Martin has created at times going even further . It 's a big beast of a book and it does n't really resolve much of anything but like his many cyvasseplaying characters Martin is just setting up the pieces for the end . This is the calm before the storm the flash of lightning before the rumble of thunder . It lacks in payoff but when considering the overall size of the story it 's a minor complaint . ",3
"I loved the first three books in Martin 's series . Now in A Dance with Dragon I feel like I 'm seeing the same things over and over again . It 's hard for me to get interested when a new character is introduced because I figure his or her head will be on a pike in a chapter or two.But I keep reading which means Martin is doing something right . ",2
"My opinion of this book keeps wandering back and forth without really getting anywhere like a fair number of its characters . Nevertheless here 's a road map so farDuring initial readthrough Can not stay awake . Too many turtles . ~3 starsOccasionally interspersed midread and lingering afterward What the hell were those bogus plot twists ? Most of this book could 've been titled 'Dancing with Godot ' wrt plotscharacters stagnating and going retrograde and the few apparent bits of supposed plot development came out of nowhere . ~2 starsDeveloping over the next few weeks of reading fan discussion forums Hey I did n't catch all those little details about dangerous dining mushroom soup and wedding pie and stuff like that that 's pretty cool . ~4 starsDrifting downward again as I struggled to actually reread the book itself but got bogged back down in the Meereeenese quagmire Y'know I do n't enjoy spending time in WesterosEssos anymore . In previous books I thought this world was grim and backstabby but it was grim and backstabby in an interesting way and I wanted to see how it changed the characters who managed to survive . But now I 'm starting to lose interest in those characters especially since the past two books like Buffy season 6 have been about everyone 'learning to fail ' which may be important and necessary life lessons but they 're not my idea of entertainment . And on reflection I kinda resent that most of my actual enjoyment of this book had to be crowdsourced by proxy via reading other people 's pickups of the significance of otherwise throwaway lines.So if you factor in the online crowdsourcing forums I 'd be willing to average the book up to 3 stars.But my rating for the book itself remains bottomed out at two .

"Does anyone have a clue as to where this series is going ? Martin seems to be mired in a morass of his own making . He 's going nowhere and taking an eternity to get wherever nowhere is . The cliffhangers are getting stale the characters are becoming less and less engaging and I 'm at the point where I do n't even care how the series ends any more . Martin needs to do everyone a favor and wrap the whole thing up once and for all . But from the way this series is creeping on and on and on I have a sinking feeling the ending is going to be less of a bang than a whimper.Judy Lind ",1
"Despite many negative reviews the writing is just as great as any of the other books if not better . The problem with the book is that it does not stand alone as an independent work by any measure . The beginning and ending are absolutely arbitrary . There is no beginning end or climax . It 's like a single chapter removed from a complete work . While all series literature must deal with this problem to some extent SOIAF is by far the worst I 've read in this respect . Making matters even worse it will likely be years before the next book is released . The root of all this evil is GRRM 's absurdly slow progress . He should be put on house arrest until he finishes . . . with no football . ",3
"Where to startat the end of Book 3 I asked myself what happened to this person or that person and had accepted that some of my favorite characters had diedwelllll maybe maybe not ! ! ! I truly enjoyed this book and believe it or not read it in only a weekand then I finished and said to my self what happened to this character or that character and found out that I will have to wait for a while to find outand true to form some of my favorite characters appear to have died in this one alsowelll will have to wait and seelooking forward to the next final ? installment ",4
"This book was good but not great . Many of the characters you love have very minor rolls in this book which was a little disappointing . There are some very interesting changes that I 'm guessing will conclude in book six . I hope George R.R . Martin does not feel any pressure to complete book six because of the HBO series . I would rather wait three years for a excellent book than have him rush for an average book . I 'm looking forward to book six . ",3
"A thrilling story which seems not to be ending soon . That 's nice as we all are enjoying it very much ! ",4
"I love George RR Martin I think that he is an amazing and talented author I am sad that this book is over I feel like I have more questions than answers and I do n't like how the book was ended . I hope that Mr. Martin does n't take 10 years to release the next book . ",3
"This book has some good moments but he really does need a good editor.At this point it 's probably best to consider the 4th and 5th books as soap opera not high fantasy . I detested the 4th book as it was truly boring and tedious to wade through . This one is marginally better but should have been much better.Aaaah well you 're probably best borrowing it from the library if you must read it . Do n't pay full price for it . ",1
"Since there are supposed to be two more volumes at least it will be a long wait for the next one . This one definitely starts to bring the threads together . But as usual the multiple cliffhangers at the end leave one wishing for more . ",4
"This audio CD does not do justice at all to the story . Every man portrayed sounds like a pirate with a bad cold and about 70 years old regardless of the age of the character . If the voice is not an old phlegmy pirate it is the voice of a dumb cockney street urchin . Dotrice robs the female characters of all depth and meaning . I have listened to all the audio books of this series and all suffer but this is by far the worst . A new reader for this series is badly needed.As far as the book itself I confess I want to see this story to the end but this is way to dragged out and slow . The book plods along interspersed with important and or exciting events only rarely . Could be so much better . Perhaps I will take the HBO route instead . ",0
"The story itself has simply flown out of control . Martin has lost his ability to move the reader through the story . There are POV chapters which seem to be present simply for the sake of being there . Martin clearly needs an editor with the ability to tell him when he is going off on too many rabbit trails.Roy Dotrice 's narration is mostly fairly terrible . When he voices almost any female character they sound like the leprechaun from old Lucky Charms commercials . Most of the character accents sound rough and bumpkinish it 's almost as if Dotrice is only capable of doing a very few voices and he 's forced to stretch his limited ability over Martin 's far too many characters .

"Good page turner . I enjoy the series . I was hoping that by the time I read this book that the final book would be out . ",3
"I read all five books of GRRM 's A Song of Ice and Fire in quick succession . I can only say that I was totally disappointed in A Dance With Dragons . After a prologue which at best was confusing and accomplished nothing 71 Chapters and an epilogue the question must be asked Where 's the beef ? A Dance With Dragons really makes me wonder if GRRM 's heart is really in this series anymore . Simply put A dance With Dragons is a one thousand page epic of dull dragging incestuously selfreferential clich & eacuteridden language soapopera style narrative in which nothing significant reaches any kind of conclusion . Also that I can do without the voyeuristic sex and the explicit detail of bodily functions and parts in endless details about bowel movements Wildling penis size peeing frozen snot and on and on . That type of gritty realism detail detracts from the story for me and is not necessary.The first three books were excellent . Rich in detail and well written . Then came A Feast for Crows . The plot bogged down and did not move forward . Not to worry said I. Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind experience the same issues with The Wheel of Time and The Sword of Truth series before they righted their series ships . Surely GRRM would pay heed to the criticism AFFC received and pick up the plot and move it forward at a much faster pace . Unfortunately Not only did he not pick it up he kicked it into the basement and plot movement ground to a virtual standstill.Jon essentially spends 13 chapters moving the Wildings south of the Wall and worrying about food only to get the Ides of March treatment from four of his Crows . Why spend that much time developing a character only to kill him off . Well maybe now we will at least be rid of Mormonts stupid raven screaming corn corn corn every other sentence . With the death of Jon Snow GRRM has managed to kill off every character I had any feeling for . Well Catelyn is still around after her rather bazaar resurrection . So is Arya but I have no clue what she is turning into for the ManyFaced God.Daenerys Mother of Dragons spends her 10 chapters holed up in the cesspool city of Mereen and dithering with palace intrigues and fighting a guerilla war with the Sons of the Harpyonly she never does any fighting just takes casualties for the whole bloody book while everything falls apart around her . Well she does have several steamy bath scenes with some of her ladiesHBO ought to love them . Bold adventurous Dany who I though was on her way to Kings Landing turned into an abusive mother who put her children the Dragons in chains and turned into a handwringing indecisive soap opera queen.And that brings me to Tyrion who also got 10 chapters . Our friendly dwarf spends his time making cynical comments to minor characters on a boring journey in which he ends up on a sinking ship with Ser Jora who is taking him to Daenerys . In the next Tyrion chapter the slippery halfpint appears on the slave block in Mereen along with Ser Jora . Ahhh could it be that he will finally be able to ally himself with Daenerys ? She could certainly use his help at intrigue . But no the Dragon queen flits off to never never land on the back of her black dragon leaving us with several chapters of Ser Barristan agonizing over everything and nothing . He does take Daenerys husband who is also the King of Mereen captive . To what end we kind of never find out.Unfortunately in GRRM 's world all the good guys die only to be replaced by simpering directionless two dimensional uninteresting characters that are sent on never ending journeys . If anything bad can happen to the good guys it does . I can also do without the GREAT amount of senseless killing rape torture disease etc . that seems to dominate all of the books but especially dominates A Dance With Dragons.But it 's not just good guys GRRM kills off . The arch villain Tywin Lannisteralso gets deepsixed by Tyrion leaving the plot with no real antagonist of any consequence . Cersei might have filled that role had not GRRM not use her two chapters to debase her into another whiney paranoid soap queen who spends one whole chapter walking naked through Kings Landing . I guess you could make Roose Bolton into an antagonisthe and his bastard psychopathic son Ramsay make a good pairbut other than gratuitous rape torture and mayhem they are shallow and two dimensional . So who is left ? Errrrr.The line up on the Protagonist side is not much better . Daenerys is about the only major player left from Game of Thrones . Well there is Theon Greyjoybut he has been made over into the unheroic Reek . Then there is Bran who spent his three chapters learning to talk to trees and sliding in and out of the bodies of Ravens his direwolf and Hodor.So after five books we are left with no clearcut protagonist or arch antagonist . As I said earlier I do n't think this series will ever be completed . If GRRM does write another book it had better be on a 2year cycle not a 5year cycle.In conclusion I do n't like A Dance With Dragons . It was not a good read for me . I say this in the face of a large number of reviews and critiques that rave about GRRM 's A Song of Fire and Ice series being Adult Fantasy . I can honestly say that I agree with them as the coarse language how many degrading ways can you say vagina numerous rape and sex scenes the obvious pornographic BDSM of the slaver cities certainly earn a XXX rating in my opinion . It is gritty reality at its unbest but I can already see the HBO execs drooling over it . But to me it is a complete turnoff as was the book itself . ",1
"Quite a writer vivid characters lots of war lots of killing character development excellent never boring .. made into HBO series ",4
"Clearly George Martin is being paid by the word.What else could account for a 1000page novel with more emphasis on describing food clothing hairstyles scenery and the genealogy of every plant the allegedlymain characters traipse by on their slog from nowhere the location the plot reached at the end of A Feast for Crows to nowhere the plot 's final resting place ? The edition of A Feast for Crows that I read from Amazon 's box set of the first four novels included an apology for that novel 's lack of focus and plot development with a promise that A Dance with Dragons would make up for it . Consider that promise well and truly broken.Rather than plot advancement we get a second helping of Feast 's emphasis on who wore what the trivialities on which they pondered as the trudge through exhaustivelydescribed scenery and a glutton 's enthusiastic recounting of every dish at every meal what it looked smelled and tasted like where the ingredients came from and how they were prepared ad infinitum . One suspects that the author was perpetually hungry while writingand perhaps should have scheduled his time at the typewriter _after_ his meals instead of before them.There 's also the nowformulaic buildup of some character 's plans his surmounting obstacle after obstacle drawing evernearer to success and then BOOM death from out of nowhere . Gratuitously killing off main characters just for the shock value ceased to entertain after about book 2.I 'm grateful that I had n't spent much time waiting for the release of this book having been introduced to the series by HBO and having read all five in quick succession . If I were one of the unlucky earlyadopters who waited for years and years to get book 4 and then book 5 I might well be organizing some sort of sitin protest at Bantam until they agreed to handcuff no less than two rigorous editors to the author from now until the series is completed.As it is I am unlikely to buy any further books in the series I 'll simply wait until others have bought read and been disappointed by them and then borrow their copies .

"Martin 's latest installment in his epic pulls in the reigns a little bit taking us out of the hot mess that is Westeros for the most part and finally starting to stitch the eastern and western sagas together through use of traveling characters bonds of alliegance and revenge It becomes clearer and clearer that though magic is flowing back into the world because of Danarys ' children such power is no simple thing to control and exacts prices that individual players in this ongoing game of thrones may not be willing to pay . At least not by themselves.Though I would call their stories the most compelling of the lot we hear comparatively little of either Bran or to a lesser extent Arya . I am not sure if that means there will be more focus on them as intensely magical and pivotal characters in the future or if they will slowly decay back into dust if and when the Targaryan queen loses one or all of her dragons . All the focus in ' A Dance With Dragons ' seems to be on characters who are striving now traveling now working now on the fringes now but for all that arguably more important due to their rangings . Fortunately that means Cerci Lannister is finally set to cooling her heels . For those who have said here that one feels more softly towards her at the end I must wholeheartedly disagree . She deserved much worse and more suffering than the measly pittance meted out . I have no problems with who she may choose to sleep with in the books despite personal feelings at odds with incest But she is nasty callous powerhungry and more than a little stupid about the way she politics . Frankly I 'd like to see her thrown in a blender with old weasly lord Frey and made into dragon slurry inch by bloody inch but Robb Stark died two books ago as meet proof that I do n't get what I want here though I 'm quite happy to continue reading anyway.I think we finally have the beginnings of the rise to peak though in a narrative that 's already some four thousand pages long and counting even denoument will likely take a book 's worth of pandering But in the immediate future there 's this whole sloppy Slaver 's Bay war to deal with and with the flux galloping much and more could easily change the whole tangent of the saga . I just ca n't wait to see the dragons once more on the move and if HBO gets its ' way we 'll see the next novel soon ! ! ! ",3
"It 's OK but really goes nowhere . I skimmed which is not my style . Could really have benefited from a strong editing.Is this the first book with very coarse language or do I misremember the previous books ? Many four letter words . More editing needed there too ? ",2

"I almost decided not to review Dance as there are already so many reviews that express my feelings about the book better than I can express them but here goes anywayFirst of all I really hate giving this book only 3 stars . I so much wanted to love this book and I absolutely expected to give it 5 . I was glad to dance once again with my favorite characters as well as some fascinating new ones but the music just did n't move me that much so the dances were n't all that exciting and did n't last that long . I 've waited 5 years with such great expectations but I 'm afraid this book is a bit less than I expected considering all the hype and time that preceded it . I still consider George Martin an astonishing writer I still find all of the characters he creates superbly interesting and their journey well worth following but the problem from my point of view is there was too little journey and way too much character . I did n't review any of the previous books but if I had I would give the first three 10 stars each . I was absolutely enthralled have read them each several times and hated to put them down for such mundane activities as eating and sleeping . Altho I 've also reread Feast I can only give it 3 stars as I found myself skipping through some POV 's and yawning or getting up to do other things in the middle of a POV . That 's one of the main reasons I have waited so eagerly for Book # 5 . I assumed it would redress the imbalance of Feast and take the story farther down the road.I 'm not going to review the meat of the book as this has been done and redone already . As has been said there are copious descriptions as only Martin can conceive of food landscapes palaces clothing furniture traveling etc . and I actually enjoyed them as I am constantly amazed at his creativitybut only to a point . After 500 pages it began to drag on me and I felt the need for the beat of the music to accelerate . I can not critique what Martin is doing with the scope of the story . This is his story and only he knows where he is taking it . I have to trust that he knows what he is doing and that it will all come together spectacularly in the end particularly considering what a great storyteller I consider him to be . I just hope that the next books come sooner than 5 years apart . Some of us may not be alive to finish it if he does n't speed up . I also hope he finds a REALLY GOOD EDITOR who is not afraid to slash and burnI consider the editing of this book to be woefully inadequate . I do however strongly recommend reading this book if you are as much of a fan of this series as I amyou must continue on the journey.George I have n't given up on this storyin fact when I read the last sentence in the Epilogue I HATED to close the book and leave Westeros so please give us more and please please please start the music sooner rather than later .

I really enjoy reading these books but at the close of each book there is no closure . In fact I almost feel like there are more questions than answers . I ca n't help but be worried that Martin will pass away and I 'll never know all the answers . Let 's hope that book 6 comes out much sooner than later ! ",4
"It was brain candy but still an enjoyable read . I love how George R.R . Martin feels no compunction about killing off characters . ",3
"I start this off by saying that if anyone goes into this book thinking anything significant is going to happen in the greater scheme of the plot then YOU KNOW NOTHING insert name.I think anyone who has any experience with the last couple books Martin has given us pretty much gets it by now that we have morphed into a kind of soap opera where there is lots of drama but the overall story goes nowhere . Much like in General Hospital most of the characters are transitory . They come in they go out they come back again but usually never leave for good unless you are a Stark . Of the Starks they are almost forgotten as it has been so long we have heard so little from them and they have so little influence on the plot.The series has been trending towards an unending now and this book has been worst of all in that respect . The sheer number of characters is staggering . I almost have an adverse physical reaction every time he introduces another one . Even in a huge book like this one hears little from many of them and nothing from more get it ? many and more ? . This book also manages to capture the longthoughtdead character appears vibe that you get in daytime soaps.Unfortunately also like a soap opera there is very little action again worst in the series in that regard . No kidding pulse raising moments are very few and really far between . You had better be in this for the experience as this plot moves slow.I was so glad to be rid of Jon Snow assuming we are really rid of him as his story line was absolutely glacial no reference to the Wall intended . No kidding a great deal of the book was dedicated to his character but aside from meaningless dialogues with a horde of other characters I could care less about NOTHING happened.If you are ok with all this it is not a horrible book . Many of the characters are actually engaging and the world that Martin created is still compelling . The prose is ok but not as good as it used to be . Lots of repeating stock phrases that were once clever overuse of new vocabulary words Martin must have learned Leal while studying for the SAT or something and lots of bad language used in an unimaginative manner e.g . the queen commands you to # $ % @ her seriously ? we waited how long for this ? .On the good side Martin never fails to amaze me with his ability to express human suffering and barbaric behavior.For people who have not started plowing through this series do n't start . Stick to the HBO TV series . For those already bought in go ahead and read the book use the Library if you can as I doubt you will pick it up again . Just know that the farther this thing goes on the more complicated it will get and the slower it will move.Great example of an average author who had a flash of brilliance long ago and has successfully milked while drifting back into mediocraty .

"I 'm not going to say a lot here because so many others who share my opinion have already written excellent reviews . Suffice it to say a lot happens in this book but none of it really means anything to the story . Save your money wait for a copy to come up at the library or get it in paperback after 5 12 years you can wait a few more months to read this one . ",1
"ADWD is a great book . The Ice and Fire series is well worth the time for those who are not easily offended . ",4
"I preordered the book on my kindle and hoped for the best but was sorry I bought it . Even middle books in a series require introduction development and conclusion but ADWD left you with no resolution at all ! People complain about cliffhangers but they are not even cliffhangers plotlines just end and leave you nowhere . And what 's with the title ? A Dance with Dragons ? The dragons did absolutely nothing until the very end and I certainly would n't call that a dance . The Meereen chapters were the worst long exposition about people and politics I did n't give a fig about endless inconsequential new characters and Dany devolves from a strong queen to a dumb lovesick teenager . Tyrion has lost his cutting wit and goes on a long meandering river cruise getting nowhere . Everyone in the East was heading toward Dany but noone except Quenton ! arrived . The best chapters were the ones in the North . If Martin had continued those plotlines until after the battle we would have gotten a conclusion and been eager for the next stage . Too bad he has a fangirl editor a good edit was what AFFC and ADWD really needed . ",0
"Some boring parts but overall pretty good.This was an enjoyable continuation of the Ice and Fire series but once again the author left virtually every major character in a precarious position . I did not mind it so much in the previous book because I could just start this one and find out what happens next . Now I join everyone else who must wait on book six . This is not fair to do to your readers . ",3
"I bought this for my wife who read the first four books and loves this one . It 's the right combination of fantasy plausible historical setting conflict and character development . Probably not something to keep on the shelf for future reference so a good choice for Kindle . ",4
"I do n't know why I persisted through these 5 books . Words words and more words . Martin evidently does n't know how to write a tale that has a beginning a middle and an end . He jumps from one thread to another without ever wrapping up anything . Bah ! ",0
"But ultimately the ride is worth it . I enjoyed Dance with Dragons tremendously for its writing and for connecting various strands of plot while leaving the reader wanting more.I have one major criticism which is that the overall plot of the series does not advance much . There 's a ton of character development here but little in the way of plot resolution . Minor plot points are resolved similar to what was done in Feast but the big overarching questions and problems were left largely in limbo until the next book . I am starting to doubt that Martin can finish the series in 7 books particularly if he continues at this glacial pace of plot advancement.But did I like Dance ? Yes . Would I recommend it ? Yes . ",3
"The first couple of volumes of this series were truly intriguing . It was a little offputting that Martin 's proven creativity was a little lacking with the obvious theme for the work being the English Wars of the Roses with a map that looked suspiciously like England including Hadrian 's Wall two contending families Stark York and Lannister Lancaster and knights being called ser instead of sir . But he told a rousing good tale anyway . After investing many hours reading the now five 1000page installments we deserve better than people just going and going from place to place . I know he 's busy doing his HBO miniseries on this subject but he needs to wrap this baby up before he dies on us . I 'd recommend just skipping this volume and hoping that the next one is the finale . You wo n't miss much . He definitely phoned this one in . ",0
"I gave this book 4 stars because the characters are great and the writing is excellent . This book is not as good as the first three but better then the 4th book especially the second half when the time lines come back together . My big complaint is that all of the characters who you read about in the beginning seem to just disappear when the timelines come back together . Bran and Davos do not get any chapters the second half of the book . I think spliting the 4th and 5th book the way it was done was a mistake but at the same time I 'm excited to see them correct that problem for HBO . ",3
"The book is great but you soon realize that you are merely getting another part to be continued so that robs some of the excitement . However if you 've come this far in the series you ca n't stop now . ",3
"I blew through the first four in the series but am struggling with this one . It really is just a good I think I just overdosed on the subject . ",3
"I 've read all of these but never viewed the TV series . A great story with interesting characters even if all the good guys keep getting killed . Dany needs to get her butt in gear tame her dragons & win the 7 kingdoms back . Need to hurry up get a move on with the story telling before people loose interest . Too many words used to describe minor details . ",3
"big let down not at all what i expected . first 3 books great last 2 not as good . its sad because story line started great ",2
"I was late coming to this series and have read all five books one after another . Books 12 and 3 were brilliant and held so much promise . Book 4 seemed to wander around as if the author was struggling to find a coherent story to tell . Book 5 is no more than a continuance of that lack of cohesion although the level of brutality is incomprehensively raised to a new and excessive level and the reachbacks to explain things stated as fact in Book 4 were annoying and unnecessary . All in all the series has lost all of its steam . It seems Martin has no idea where to take all of this next or how to end it . If there is a Book 6 I 'll probably read it though I expect no more than more disjointed and pointless minor episodes that have little or no connective tissue between them . Put simply Martin can and probably should just put a fork in it it 's done.As to the HBO series there is a Season 2 on the way and maybe a Season 3 but I doubt it will go much beyond that . There is no cohesive story that could be dramatized in Books 4 and 5 . Maybe if Martin moves quickly and manages to complete a Book 6 that actually brings an end to the ramblings some producer might see some value in combining Books 45 and 6 into one final season but I doubt it .

"I spent more time than I should have reading one review after another . Most loved GRRM 's writing but listed in graphic detail the negative aspects of his latest work . While reading this series I 've found that much of it could be loosely based on ancient and medieval history . Characters change with age or a shift in their life situations . Some children were the product of good parenting while others could easily be the basis for a fantasydriven version of psychotherapy . The children turn out to be the strongest and smartest of the series those that have n't fallen to horrible deaths . Pick a ruling family from Europe during the first millennium and you 'll find stories equally as horrible.GRRM does n't sit at his desk and wait for his readers to advise on what to do with each character and how to develop each kingdom . He is a master at what he does and many authors of his caliber also write books of 850 to 1200 pages . They also take years between novels and we gladly wait for each of them . He stands far above the bookofthemonth writers . I 've always found when reading fantasy or scifi you have to jump in the deep end and let the writer take you to places you could n't possibly imagine . It 's like a leap of faith . In for a penny in for a pound . I 've loved the entire Ice and Fire series because even when the characters are n't your favorite and the plots seem to move a little slower he 's usually taking you to places he has n't shown you yet like in Feast . You get a taste of every kingdom and the lands beyond the narrow sea . It just happened to take him more than 5000 pages to get us to this point . And what a 5000 pages it was . I will agree with readers who complained about the extensive lists of people their sigils clothing and food . But I 'm willing to swim in the deep end for a few thousand more pages with an open mind.GRRM is the story teller and I am in search of a fantastic diversion . After all my time is valuable and a bookamonth author has nothing to offer me . ",3
"In my opinion people who did n't enjoy this book simply are n't a fan of Martin . It seems the biggest problem is the creation of alternate story lines and focusing most of the book on what happens away from Kings Landing . That is actually what I enjoy most about Martin 's books . He creates an entire world with so many intricate pieces and does n't focus on one single small area.I have absolutely no problems with this book as a setup and it was necessary to the overall plot of the series . I enjoyed most of the additional characters introduced in this book and Martin created some good cliffhangers for the Winds of Winter . After A Game of Thrones this may be my favorite of the series . ",4
"Books 4 and 5 of this series became somewhat tedious reading this being Book 5 as indicated by the author books 4 and 5 was originally one book but divided into two due to its length . George R. R. Martin strayed a little too far from the original characters fleshing out peripheral characters introduced in books 1 through 3 . In doing so he made the story difficult to follow and quite honestly not all that entertaining . The portions of the books that pay attention to the remaining Starks the Lannisters and the Dragon Queen are interesting but the others should have remained in the background . I really enjoy his unpredictability with what happens to the characters but he leaves the development of those stories for far too long making it extremely difficult to remember what was happening to them when last heard from . Martin 's efforts to create this magical world became far too ambitious with a disappointing result . I am still looking forward to future books but hope he returns to the formula that made books 1 through 3 so successful . ",2
"Loved the series hated the ending . Because it will take at lrast three more books to resolve it all . Damn you George . ",3
"I got this book for my wife who is reading the whole series . While she liked this book she felt it was more drawn out and less interesting than others in the series . ",3
"again a great books that should be at school lib . Waiting for more books in series . Missed the tv series the first time will not next time ",4
"Really a good book as long as you read the series . If you read only this book you will miss a lot . ",4
"great addition to an awesome series . it is a very long read but well worth it . if you like the series its a must have ",4
"I enjoyed the first three books but in this book the series has become three parts sadism to one part plot advancement . And even that plot advancement has become a Willy Wonka like two steps forward one step back . Martin has allowed his backstory to swallow the momentum he 'd built up so successfully in the early books . The cliffhanger at the end of each chapter has grown stale and when dead characters do n't stay dead the suspense is muted . Martin likes to tease his readers bringing major characters in close proximity of one another and then yanking them apart with at best minimal interaction.This has started to feel like a shaggy dog story and as such I 'm beginning to lose interest . ",2
"I read a lot . I read a lot of fiction non fiction classics literature manuals blah blah blah . I own thousands of books . when i was younger I would read a book through no matter how bad as I have gotten older and had more demands on my time I 've realised the folly in this so gladly toss aside a book that is worthless and shun authors who have disappointed me too often.I might read Winds of Winter if it comes out and if I have not decided to read something else at the time . I enjoyed a Game a Thrones and a Clash of Kings and a Storm of Swords . I slogged through Feast but could not reread it . I struggled through Dance and will not waste time rereading it . I could give a synopsis of this 959 page book in less than 5000 words and none of them would be used describing the menu or the wine or the beer.This series suffers from the lack of a decent editor who would look at the pages and cut them by 75 % and tell Martin to tighten things up to get to the story to dispense with tricks and cliff hangers and again get to the story.Feast showed us the story had gotten away from Martin . Dance shows us he is still not sure what to do where to go how to proceed . Both Feast and Dance could have been combined as was originally planned into one book and that book could have been less than 500 pages and we would have cried out for more rather than plodding through a tired replay of feasts and argument and schemes we 've seen many too many times before.A good editor would have kept Martin focused on the story but editors lose the spine when an author becomes popular and they let any old POS get published as long as there is a ready audience to snap it up and cry for more.I came to the series late . I got Game and Clash for $ 4 as single book . I bought Storm for $ 6ish I believe I paid $ 12ish for Feast and I proordered Dance for around $ 15 . My initial $ 10 investment was sound . My later $ 27 was not.Others have said nothing happens in this book . I disagree . We get about 100 pages of story . The problem is that there are 959 pages in the book and teasing the story from these pages is tiresome work . ",2
"So like most here I 'm a big GRRM fan . We all loved books 13 . Feast left us a little disenchanted . But we told ourselves hey no worries . It 's just a buildup to major events in book 5 ! Martin is way too good of a writer to put us through that dreadful slump that many epic fantasy series go through once they extend past a trilogy . And then we read Dance . Hachi machi Allow me to tantalize you with a few highlights mild SPOILER alert Jon and the Wall Got ta love Jon right ? The classic underdog now assuming his rightful role as a leader and a hero . He must have a compelling story to tell in this book . Right ? Wrongo . Consider the Wall . It 's a fantasy writer 's dream . You 've got a hoard of mysterious Wildings to work with . You 've got giants . Skinchangers . Mammoths dire wolves giant boars . You 've got an enigmatic red sorceress now . Greenseers and threeeyed crows . Real honesttogoodness magic ! Dudes who love talking about how big their members are . And to top it all off you 've got an army of frozen freaking zombies coming ! What does it all add up to ? The most boring location in the book that 's what . How ? Because not a damn thing happens . Jon dicks around chapter after chapter accomplishing in 10 chapters what could 've been covered in 2 . Labored reading does n't begin to cover it . Worst chapter Jon stands around for 15 or so pages and watches 3000 wilding walk past him . That 's it . Compelling stuff . Dany How do you covert one of the most popular characters in the series into one the reader ca n't stand ? Simple . Turn her into a whining simpering girl who can barely decide what clothes to put on in the morning . Yes we get that she 's still a young girl who is inexperienced to some extent with leadership . But come on She 's commanded a hoard of bloodthirsty barbarian warriors owns and controls THREE fire breathing dragons has conquered at least 2 cities is apparently impervious to fire yet still easy on the eyes has the blood of ancient royalty running through her veins and earned the loyalty of thousands of people who barely know her . I think that gives her enough confidence to not turn into a love stricken teenager for some tool of a mercenary captain and instead get on with her war . Worst chapter Dany walks through fields and fields of grass eating berries and getting bit by ants while she thinks . Her concluding chapter by the way . Awesome reading . Arya 's chapters Unreadable . I do n't care about her training . It 's so damn boring I ca n't stand it . Get her the hell out of there and back to Westeros pronto comprende ? Unnecessary tertiary characters Enough already . Focus on the characters you have . They 're good work with them . Maybe add one or two . But I really do n't need to read about 10 more random lords or forgotten sons . Get on with it . Repeated terminology GRRM is somewhat guilty of this throughout the series but cranks it up a notch in Dance . Did he get a dictionary of obscure medieval terms and just fall in love with a few ? If I have to read about nightsoil or leal servants anymore I might just declare this book as useless as nipples on a breastplate . I mean I know words are wind and if I look behind I 'm lost but how many words can you rhyme with Reek ? Maybe I 'm just being a being a butt boy here . And of course the plodding pace . Yikes . I thought Ice and Fire would escape this but it 's falling into the same trap as so many fantasy series Wheel of Time comes to mind where the pace slows considerably more and more characters are added and you become less enthusiastic with each book . Even in the worst of Wheel of Time books and they were freaking bad do n't let anyone fool you there was always some kind of payoff in the end a big battle a major magical undertaking something . Here we get squat . Maybe it 's juvenile to expect some action scenes in the book and if so then I 'm certainly guilty but damn did this lack the balls of the first 3 books . Deepwood Motte ? That 's the best battle scene you can give me ? Inexcusable . It has n't quite reached Jordanian level where an entire chapter can be consumed with 3 women arguing over dresses and the type of tea to feed a pregnant woman but it 's pretty damn close.To be fair parts were still interesting . I kind of liked Reek . Tyrion is amusing as always . But when Cersei 's chapters are more interesting than Jon or Dany 's combined something has gone awry in Westeros . ",0
"I loved the first three books but four and five are basically 2000 pages of nothing . It is clear that Martin is milking the story and has absically abandonded anything resembling a plot now that he can start collecting HBO royalities and stretch this out as long as possible . The books read like a soap opera and moves just about as fast . To be honest there are about 400 pages of intersting well written story telling embedded in the almost 2000 pages of books four and five . Good luck inding them . ",0
"I mean really do we need an explicit sex scene or reference every other chapter ? George 's writing has deteriorated to a bizarre medieval sex fantasy . There is more carnal knowledge in the work than in his entire forst several books combined ! The story line takes place concurrently with the previous work . We trace Tyrion at first through the expanded eastern lands on a journey to connect with the Dragon Queen . After several bizarre hand offs we are left to find him playing a stooge in front of the conquered city of Meereen . The chapters are tightly written and the internal dialogue of characters is solid . Theon Greyjoy Jon Snow and Tyrion are particulalry well fleshed out . The problem is that Martin seems to turn to extreme profanity sexual predation and abusive circumstances in his scenes . This becomes almost ridiculous throughout the book . A perfect example is the scene in which Ramsay Bolton confronts his new bride in the presnce of the captured and beaten Greyjoy . Suffice to say that the descriptive natur eof that scene is wholly unnecessary to the plot establishing Greyjoy 's subservience Jeyne 's victimization or the sheer insanity of Bolton . I am certain this is Mrtin 's way of getting the next miniseries installment onto the Playboy channel instead of HBO . ",1
"The book was interestingbut like book 4 the story ends abruptly . It is starting to be a jokeif I have to wait 5 years for another half baked story I am going to put the series out if mind until it is completed . Hopefully Martin does n't drop dead before he decides to finishlike Jordan . Do n't get me wrong I love both authorsthey just set the bar high so they are judged harshly . ",2
"The saving grace for this book is that it returns to some of our favorite viewpoint characters Jon Dany Tyrion etc . There is a lot more action to the plot of this installment and the reader can feel the stage being set for a grand finale which is allegedly occurring over the next two novels set to be released sometime before the armageddon.There are a few issues with this book which I 've come to expect from the series . The first relates to Martin 's epilogue from book four in which he explains that A Dance with Dragons will go back and tell the story of other characters during the events of A Feast for Crows . The issue is simple this is not true . Chronologically this book catches up with its predecessor only about one third of the way through leaving the reader confused about the order of events in the two books.Martin continues with the irritating addition of trivial viewpoint characters . Without revealing any spoilers the biggest failure of this book is its refusal to deal with integral action . There are a few happenings that are built up to be major events and when they actually occur the reader is instantly disappointed with their anticlimactic treatment.Overall this novel is worth the read for entertainment 's sake and if you 're like me you are already hooked on the series anticipating the finale . However if you were hoping also like me that Martin 's writing took a turn for the better at this point in the series it did n't . ",3
"I had read a few reviews of this book before I started and expected much worse but was surprised when I got caught up in it in the end . Do not get me wrong this is no where near as enthralling as Storm of Swords but in the end I could n't put it down.Once you get past the first half of the book which runs the same timeline as Feast for Crows New information and old friends 're appear . A few un expected twists at the end leaves me waiting impatiently for Winds of Winter.Bottom line is if you have read the other 4 books you may as well read them all . ",3
"Martin is simply an incredible author . This story just keeps getting better and better and i cant wait to read more . ",4
"I thoughtA Feast for Crows A Song of Ice and Fire Book Four Martin George Rrwas somewhat disappointing . And after making fans wait so long for book five I was concerned that Martin was losing steam . I am so happy to have been wrong . This book was my favorite in the series so far.I could n't disagree more with the reviewers who complain that Martin spent too long building up to things that never happened . I thought that Martin did an incredible job of building suspense in this book . Some of the story lines had great climaxes in this book others are set up perfectly for a hugely eventful book six.I was also very impressed by Martin 's ability to introduce new characters and plot lines that quickly drew me in . In the earlier books I frequently found that some chapters were much more engaging than others . But in A Dance with Dragons I never had that feeling of wanting to get through a chapter so that I could get to a more interesting one.I will admit that Tyrion 's story which was always one of my favorites in the other books is a bit disappointing in this one . At first I was also a bit let down by Daenerys 's story but as I kept reading I realized that the earlier chapters were the perfect setup for the end of the book.I do n't think I 've ever felt as engaged in a story as I was reading this book . I felt sad to have finished it and I can not wait for book six . ",4
"I love the whole series of A Game of Thrones . It is entertaining right through ! ! Be careful when purchasing as the same book can have different titles ! ! Keeps you interested throughout and is not predictable ! ! Lots of interesting twists and turns . Love it ! ! ",4
"I admit have not read this book . I was already dragged into the same situation by the author Robert Jordan and vowed not to be dupped again . I DID read the first three books in this series as recommended by my brother and only started it when I was told in no uncertain terms that the author promised to keep it to three books or was it four ? . Anyway I had no intention of chasing another mirage of a story never ending in my lifetime or the authors . Robert Jordan 's first 5 books I believe are genius but then something happened . The scent of money ? Who knows ! I wish George R.R . Martin luck with his storylines but if these reviews are any indication I will not be touching them anytime soon ",2
"This book is amazing . It takes simultaneously as book 4 but the much loved characters that we were missing ahem TYRION DANY are fully covered here . So it 's much more enjoyable and really makes us want another damn book already George ! The show is catching up quickly ! ! ",4
"Like so many other fans I 've waited a grand total of 5 and a half years to read this book.While there are many theories as to why it took Martin this long to pump out this sequel the fact of the matter is that this book weighs in at over 1000 pages exceeding even the massive A Storm of Swords . This many pages dedicated to A Song of Ice and Fire should be a boon to any hardcore fan of the books in theory . But did it deliver ? I 've got a somewhat simple rule when it comes to novels the longer it is the better I expect the book to be . In a world where an author demands this much of my time their story had best be worth it because there are always other books worth reading out there . The first four books in my opinion were all well worth the time . Did this one follow suit ? The good news+ Martin still meets his high standards for level of detail and his world breathes as strongly as it ever did . In retrospect I wish I would have brushed up on the happenings of the first four books again before tackling this one . 6 years is a long time to have to remember every nuanced character and noble family crest and lineage and who fathered what bastard etc . But it 's all well worth it . More backstory on many many characters and we even get more slices of history such as parts involving Robert 's Rebellion Honestly if Martin had the time and inclination I 'd love to see a novel on this part of Westeros history.+ If your favorite character was missing from A Feast for Crows they got center stage here . Tyrion is a personal favorite of mine and he helped carry this book for me even if his character arc in this particular novel was well below the standards for Storm of Swords Though to be honest that is a hard act to follow . Daenarys also plays a major role Well the title sort of makes that obvious I suppose.The bad news The POV character selection in this book is by and large about as organized as a ten year old 's closet . As Martin himself states in the foreword I only mention this to make it obvious I 'm not spoiling much if anything some characters from Crows do pop up later in the novel . And they do . But each of them only gets one or two chapters where not too much actually happens . Honestly I 'd have much preferred if he had left these snippets out and simply added them to the next book rather than giving us tiny updates on characters that do n't even really address anything that happened from Crows with one exception . But having read the ending I can understand why he felt compelled to include what feels literally like a tiny slice of the next book.And then he brings in 3 new POV characters . As if he did n't have enough already . I understand the need for one of them later in the book but another one only gets one chapter . I did n't get a chance to feel like it built any continuity with them and when that happens they feel unnecessary . Not too much actually happens in this novel . It 's brutal but the truth . Oh sure some characters are left in peril and others meet unfortunate ends . If you 're a fan of this series you already knew this was going to happen . But Martin spends almost all of those 1000 pages hyping three major conflicts and where does the book end ? Right before we learn what happens in any of them . I 've heard stories of how Martin has struggled more and more to wrestle this story of his into prose and I 'm inclined to believe it . I know he 's a big time veteran author with his own hit HBO series now but the fact of the matter is that he needs an editor to help him pace his story if he really desires a return to the quality of his previous books.Bottom line Was it worth it ? Yes and no.Yes because it 's more A Song of Ice and Fire and because this book sets up The Winds of Winter to be one of the most exciting books in the series.No because this book feels like nothing but filler and cliffhangers when it should be able to stand on its own merit.I can only hope this dip in quality can be rectified in the next book and even more importantly that I wo n't have to wait another 6 years to find out . ",2
"first wan na say i 'm an old hat to the series . but i do n't know where it 's going or how it can resolve all the loose bits . the ending will make you want to give up on the series . i ca n't recommend this until we see how it resolves . GRRM wrote an excellent world fun characters you 're invested in and a big convoluted plot . before this book . series went off the rails at a feast for crows . i used to tell everyone who could read to read these books . but not since the last two . ",2
"I dearly love epic fantasy . But . After slogging through some of the mire of words endless words and plot threads and new characters who are these people ? this eagerlywaitedfor edition disgorged I started getting impatient and hopping through the book forlornly searching for any crumbs about the characters I had come to care about . The more I tried to read the more I was forcibly reminded of the frequently hysterical remarks posted at Amazon about the later works of Robert Jordan people mess with their hair and walk around and think about stuff and nothing happens ! Well stuff happens in DWD most of it swathed in meandering plot lines that go here and there . Every now and then I was able to extract an entertaining nugget but mostly I was bored or irritated . I think this is Martin 's revenge on all of us who fell in love with this series and harassed him to finish the book George . And yes it 's dark and just plain lurid in parts with little relief . Reminds me of a 60 Minutes episode on a modern art where a line of urinals and a pile of candy was considered art . Or the painting that said RAT RAT RAT that sold for $ 30000 I think . Too bad Martin IS a terrific writer too bad I 'll shell out for the next installment because I ca n't stand not to . Rats rats rats . It breaks my heart because I like so many others had waited for this volume for so long.I give it 3 stars because even this bloated meandering mass of spaghetti is better written than most of the fantasy out there kudos to anyone who can read this word by word but I thought James Joyce pulled a fast one on everyone too .

"I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the dragon world . The book was very inciting and left you wondering what next . Very good book . ",4
"An amazing . Tale of greed lust fire and desire with dashes of duty drive the story forward . As powerful and blinding as contemporary politics suck as Nixon 's downfall travel gate Clinton 's legacy and Obama 's failure to restore propriety along with our current political system of lobbyists and bitter wars and genocides all taking place right now on our planet . I do n't believe the intrigue and plots can get any better ! ",4

"Thought I would never get through this book but kept at it expecting some answers only to discover there are 2 more books . I think I 'm done . ",1
"Read the other four first and this one is more of a great thing ! One note it is parallel in time to book four . ",4
"I wish George would write faster my biggest complaints is that he takes way too long between books and even within books we sometimes go hundreds of pages to pick up a storyline again . ",2
"It took me five books to figure this out but now I get it . In GRRM 's bio he has some screenwriting credits . Duh ! He 's a screenwriter ! These are not novels they are scripts complete with everything everybody involved in the production needs to know all the costumes sets props extras set dressing lighting atmospherics score dialogue He 's just making sure the producers get it all right . It 'd be like Michelangelo writing in all the little numbers on the Sistine Chapel ceiling so his assistants could put the paint in all the right places ! You can see how that has evolved over the yearsbooks . By the last two books he 's figured out that if you make the production lavish enough you do n't need so much story . Curiosity may compel me to read # 6 if it is published before I change channels . ",3
"The first three books in this series were five star but books four and five were very disjointed hard to keep track of and left me very confused and not looking for more.Five just seemed like the author was in a rush to finish the story line . which was not done at least that is my perception . ",2
"I 've given it five stars because it is easy to see the amount of work that went into it . I 'd recommend this book to anyone into the fantasy genre . Logic might dictate that fans of the show would love the books but I 've known more than one fan who ca n't be bothered to read.I ca n't wait for the next one ! ",4
"Not to pile on but this is 3stars and 3 primarily because I am so invested in the characters off the credit of the first three books that I still cared what happened to them . Love the series . Tolerated the fourth book . I would argue this was even worse than the fourth . The criticism of the fourth besides little advancement of the primary plot was it focused on the characters we did n't care as much about . True . But I did come around to caring a bit . This book does the opposite it actually made me care less about some of my favorite characters . It is sad the way he diminishes Dany 's story . Or the way he spends most of the book showing what a strong leader Jon is only to have him act illogically near the end . Or the way Tyrion does almost nothing at all except loath in selfpity . Only when he starts negotiating for himself at the end does he show any spark of his old self at all and it is but a few pages.In its defense each book seems to introduce a new societal consequence to highlight . The fourth focused on the reemergence of religion in the chaos and leadership void . This one on the unintended consequences of disrupting the slave trade and societal order . I 'm glad he finds room for these expansion themes amidst the plotting and characters . He is still a good written and overall amazing world builder . But he 's definitely lost momentum and gotten bogged down . He needed a strong editor as a full and empowered partner and clearly did n't have that influence.At this point there is no way all the characters and subplots he has introduced will have satisfying full arcs . It 's one thing to complicate a story and another to burden it with a thousand points of light . He 'll need to start abruptly killing characters off without real purpose in mass . It is the Lost equivalent of having a hundred Walts ` hey look the kid is special oh wait never mind we decided to go a different way so we 'll just send him home ' ",2
"the chapters about tyrion bran and reek were wonderful . those chapters alone were worth the price of the book.too bad the remaining chapters were comainducingslow . and repetitive . and slow . and repetitive . if the phrase you know nothing jon snow appears in book 6 i 'm giving up on the series .

"I decided not to read this because of the reviews.The 5 star reviews did n't make me want to read it.The 1 star reviews convinced me that I would n't enjoy it.I read the first 4 books and # 4 even though it was readable was not a page turner.My advice ? Read the summaries of what happens then find some other author to read . ",0
"By this book I 'm skimming most of it because it 's more description description description for a tv series to make sure the set and costumes look perfect ? ? ? Good grief . There may be closure with some of the stories somewhere but I give up and I 'm very sorry I paid for all five books too bad book one was great but this has become silly and silly me for not realizing it by book three .

"What happened to Bran ? Rickon ? Sansa ? Arya is a cutthroat child living across the narrow sea ? Daenarys just flies off on a dragon ?

"While being another solid entry in this series its not my favorite . Some of the dramas especially the dragon lady 's are starting to get a bit tired with how long they are dragging on and how the characters continue to make the same mistakes constantly . That being said there are some good chunks of high adventure great plot thickenings all over and exciting answers are provided along with the inevitable MORE questions that make you really hate how long these books take to release . If you are a fan of the series this is totally worth buying . ",3
"This book is very good and fast developing . After the disaster that in my opinion was a Feast for Crows this was an excelent read . It is not so good as A Game of Thrones or a Storm of Swords . Nonetheless here the characters do things you never expected but that make total sense as opposite of the previous one which was very predictable in my opinion.To sum up I think you will enjoy this book although it will make you curse Martin for making you wait until his next book ",3
"ca n't wait for the next book ! Write faster ! I 'll watch the TV show since it fairly accurate to the books . ",4
"This whole series A Song of Ice and Fire is one of my all time favorites ! For people who love fantasy and adventure . I love generational books . ",4
"Book five still leaves you hanging in suspense with pretty much all characters in the story . You still want more and more . Ca n't wait for number six . ",4
"I am only 65 % through the book . I 've read all the previous books so I 'm taking my time with this one . The time line is supposed to be the same as the previous books but written from different characters ' points of view But I 've just read chapters from Jaime Lannister and Arya Stark so that time line is still being expanded . Some characters seem to die in one book only to find out that they have managed to survive which is fine by me because I do n't want all the notsoterrible characters to die quiet yet ! Since this is such a long book over 1000 pages ? I bought a Kindle edition when I purchased it the Amazon message said something about being able to download it to more than one device . I did not do it at that moment and when I tried to figure out how that could be done I was n't able to find it . I would have liked to put a copy on my desktop at work as well as on my Kindle . ",2
"Goes with the Series A Song of Ice and Fire series . George R.R . Martin is at his best . I recommend it . ",4
"It took me much longer to read this volume than previous books . I felt too many new characters were introduced so I often had to go back a few pages to reread sections . I love the main story line so hung in there too finish it . I will of course wait with great anticipation for the next book hoping for some clarification on who is who and what bigger role these new characters might play in the scheme of things . OVERALL I 'm glad I read it . ",2
"Too much violence and sexual violencethat being saidI could not out it down . Can not wait for the next book . May read again . ",4
"Ok..I wrote a previous review on ADWD the second I finished the book that was a mistake . The hype years waiting for it plus the HBO thing made me praise this book way too much for what really is..a rushed and UNFINISHED book.Yep.I guess Mr. Martin who is a GENIUS and I can not thank him enough for these wonderful books it 's paying more attention to TV land that his own books.I 'm not sure where when or how A Dance With Dragons was written but you can tell after reading the thing a couple of times 3 times for me that it 's simply not finished . It 's hackedI can even make a picture on my mindMr . Martin trying to get the book out of his way to focus on the TV Seriesand that IS A HUGE MYSTAKE.Now I personally would have preferred to wait another 2 years for this particular bookIt could have been a masterpiecenow it is what it is..PD . I guess a little part to blame is on usthe fansfor pressuring authors to pop out books as fast food nation burgerssimply can not happen.My 2 cents . ",2
"Brieflysorely disappointed in this . Maybe I lost interest over the long years inbetween but I SO looked forward to it based on the previous books and sad to say this one was returned after trying t slog through just 150 pages ! No more fantasy series for me because this book proved they never know when to end . What a grave disappointment . ",0
"There were parts of this book that seemed to really drag but others that were really good . I enjoyed it but felt like my favorite characters were disappearing when I had hoped they would endure to the last book . ",2
"I am not fond of the way the books are laid out or the prose is written . In fact I am almost through them a second time . I did n't remember much about each book . I had read . There are so many characters each chapter is from several characters points of view . No tie ins from character to character . Very hard to remember . The timelines do n't follow in any sort of continuity or . straight line . First time I have seen any type of story written like this . Very cumbersome . I tried to read the Books my Granddaughter recommended . They are also fantasy and the format is the same . It is difficult to keep track of what people are doing . In fact The author does write good scenes . He has the ability to write memorable prose . With a cast of thousands I do n't know how else he could have preserved a straight out story . Too bad because the scope of the thing is massive I remember the Classics read as a girl but these books are difficult to follow . And difficult to remember . No frame of reference . Perhaps all fantasy is presented this way ? . Some of the lovely scenes are lost because of the technique used I have no idea what the author could have done ? . I am amazed he kept his sanity writing about all these characters . Better for transition into movie scripts.. Perhaps having the prose as a screenplay was for this reason . After all the man is a multimillionaire now . Ca n't argue with that can we ? .Love the TV series . ",3
"I actually liked A Dance with Dragons more than any since A Game of Thrones . Finally I 've learned to ignore the many knights crows guards etc . who have little to do with the main plot and concentrate on the main characters . Yes the book has n't moved very far along but this was n't expected with 7 books planned . I found myself rooting for characters to succeed and shocked at the fate of several . There are quite a few cliffhangers in this book with some resolved several chapters later and some awaiting their fate in the next novel.I started this series back in November and have read all five in the months since . As in the case of any series it 's difficult to wait for the next book . However there are good summaries online that help refresh and also an app for Game of Thrones with maps places and characters . I also plan to watch the DVD of the HBO series when it comes out . ",3
"I thought I would never finish reading this book and I would not have either if it was n't for the fact that I needed to return it . Book five is a great read but the series continues to just be wordy go on and on and on . This book did not have Sansa in it at all only three chapters with Cersei and Arya in it . The characters came into the novel towards the end of the book . Bran has about five chapters before his character all together disappears from the novel about a third into the book I guess we will read more about him in the next wordy novel . Many of the chapters consisted of several new characters that in my opinion could have been left out . In book five Jon Tyrion and Dany make up most of the chapters . In the end another of my favorite characters dies the Starks do n't favor well in this series . ",3
"If you 're anything like me you suffered through A Feast for Crows just DYING for a few chapters dedicated to all of your favorite characters . Well for all that AFfC lacked A Dance with Dragons has in its possession . You 'll find this book studded with chapters for Tyrion Dany Jon Snow Jaime Lannister and even a few special new perspectives of longtime secondary characters . If you 've come this far in your journey through the song of fire and ice you 'd best carry on . But be wary fellow journeyman for the night like this book is dark and full of terrors . ",4
"I 'm giving this one star because after waiting years for the story to pick up again . This book was more disappointing than the last . It did n't go anywhere . In the end we 're basically where were with these dragons before the book . It was more plots more characters boring slow and hard to finish.Hard to finish is the least horrible thing I can say . I bought this book on pre order years ago . So I got it as soon as it came out . I just finished it yesterday . I 've read at least a dozen books since starting this book . I finally resolved to finish it and with that decided that this series is done for me . ",0
"There have been many mixed reviews on this book but my Thanks goes to its author It was a long wait but well worth it . ",4
"I was an avid fan of the first 3 George R R Martin books in this series and I anxiously awaited this last one to come out especially since it took around 6 years to write . I was horribly disappointed by this book and I honestly could not finish it.The sad truth is is that this book could have been about 300 pages and still accomplished the amount of story told in this book . Nothing actually happens . Although a large amount of time passes in this book it seems like none of the main characters actually get anywhere or accomplish anything . In fact most of the book is about people just sitting around and talking their is a chapter were a character is sitting in a room talking and only 1 sentence said in the course of 15 pages is relevant and actually forwards the plot any at all . At times I would start a chapter and wonder if I should just skim it because I wondered if it would be relevant or another character simply walking around and talking about his or her day . Their is also very little action in this book maybe 1 fight that lasts half a chapter which also hurts this book tremendously as the previous once were a non stop thrill ride.I wanted to like this book I truly did . The fact that nothing happens and that I do n't feel like I have enriched myself or the story ANY makes me realize what a tremendous waste of time it was to read this book . I pray that his last 2 books liven up the story I would hate to have this book end on such a horrendous note . ",1
"I am trying to be fair and I will not deny that this book had for me some elements of interest . I read all 5 volumes in quick succession and I still feel semiinvested . But I am honestly not sure this volume or even the series as a whole deserves even the 2 stars I am tempted to give it . GRRM has sucked me in but he also makes me feel like a sucker . And having read it I would now give 101 odds that the series will never be completed.This latest volume alone contains 959 hardback pages over 400000 words close to matching in length all 3 volumes of Tolkien 's LORD OF THE RINGS . How could a book this long contain so little in the way of plot progression ? Is the author stalling on purpose or is this the only way he can cope with some weird kind of writer 's block ? Part of the problem was that George RR Martin whatever his talent for piquing the readers interest and keeping him turning pages was never that efficient a writer . He often uses 10 words to say would could be better said in 5 . Even the early volumes could in my opinion be trimmed down significantly and be the better for it in particular I could have without the voyeuristic sex stuff constant whore references etc.. But the level of inefficiency and bloat has increased with each volume reaching new heights with the last two.The other part of the problem is the proliferation of characters and points of view POVs1 . Game of Thrones 9 povs2 . Clash of Kings 10 povs3 . Storm of Swords 12 povs4 . Feast for Crows 13 povs5 . Dance with Dragons 18 povs45 . FeastDance combined 25 povsIf you consider that FEAST and DANCE are supposed to be the same book divided by POV then you can see that the number of POVs suddenly doubled after STORM . No wonder the story suddenly became unmanageable for the author . If one divides ones story between twice as many different characters in twice as many different locations then the story can only progress half as fast . And if your chapters contain twice as much bloat as seems to have happened the your story can only progress one quarter as fast.And then the author starts repeating himself perhaps because he fears you have not seen SoandSo in so long that you have forgotten what happened last time . More bloat.A third aspect of the problem is this In the first volume not only were there only 9 povs but they were mostly gathered in the same place and time and able to help a single storyline forward . GAME OF THRONES started most of the main POVs together such that there were initially 2 main threads which then divided into 3 main threads . Only at the end of the volume were the 7 surviving POVs completely scattered to the winds . Then did the author require 2 more larger volumes to complete the same level of plot progression that the first volume had . And yet many fans remained patient and even enthusiastic . Then it got worse By the end of DANCE we still have about 20 surviving POVs and they are all still all scattered . One would think that the author would recognize this problem created by this vast scope and adjust his writing style accordingly . But no . He thinks he has the time to describe how it feels for a character to urinate and then describe a conversation he has with another character about how good he is is at urinating . Will his urinations skills have future plot relevance ? He thinks he has the time to spend an entire paragraph describing a humble boat whose sole plot function is to transport a minor character from point A to point B and leave him there and then the author wastes another paragraph on how this minor character could have arrived on a nicer boat had things been different . George you could have saved half a page there . There are COUNTLESS such examples . Each chapter needs to have its length cut in half AT LEAST.So where are we now ? How close is he to finished.THRONES was originally sold as the first of a trilogy though the author admits he already knew better at publicaton . But his trilogy plan had originally been as followsPart 1 Game of Thrones Covering War of 5 Kings.Part 2 Dance of Dragons Dany invades WesterosPart 3 Winds of WinterWell he ended up needing a full 3 volumes to complete part 1 . Part 2 was supposed to resume the story 5 years later but for whatever reason the author decided to scrap this plan and write an interim volume called FEAST FOR CROWS . Let 's call this Part 1.5 . Well as you recall FEAST ended up becoming so bloated that it had to be split in two volumes the second half being what is now being released as A Dance with Dragons.But the bad news is this unplanned Part 1.5 is not even finished . All the threads that were set up in FEAST and DANCE to converge on Meereen have not reached there yet as this latest closes . Hey remember that guy Victarion with the dragon horn who set off for Meereen at the beginning of FEAST FOR CROWS . Well he is still at sea . BUT HE 'S GETTING CLOSE ! ! ! When will Dany finally land in Westeros ? At this rate it wo n't be until volume 7 because she will need all of Volume 6 to resolve the impending climax in Meereen.So here is a release schedule with my estimated projections into the future giving George 5 years to complete each future volumePart I Vol 1 A Game of Thrones 1996Part I Vol 2 A Clash of Kings 1998Part I Vol 3 A Storm of Swords 2000Part 1.5 Vol 1 A Feast for Crows 2005Part 1.5 Vol 2 A Dance with Dragons 2011Part 1.5 Vol 3 2016 Climax in MeereenPart 2 Vol 1 . 2021 Dany reaches WesterosPart 2 Vol 2 . 2026Part 2 Vol 3 . 2031Part 3 Vol 1 . 2036Part 3 Vol 2 . 2041Part 3 Vol 3 . 2046GRRM still says he hopes to finish the series in seven volumes . But if that were so those who believed that promise had a right to expect better story progress in this volume . He should just be honest and say that he hopes to complete the series in 12 volumes and that he also hopes to live to be 120 in excellent health do n't we all . That way potential readers could make an informed decision as to whether they should invest time and money in this story.But I can not see it at his current rate . This story will not be resolved and readers who hope for a resolution are wasting their time with it . That 's how I am calling it . George you are welcome to prove me wrong . ",0
"It was n't worth the extremely long ! wait.This book makes a lot of promisesbut never quite gets around to fulfilling them.I slogged my way through it but I hope the next one is more like the first onesand do n't take so long to write either ! ",1
"Who would have thought I would have angered so many people with my initial review written about a third of the way through the book ? Here 's what I wroteI hate it when people write a review about a book they have n't finished . Really . And yet here I am . So many negative reviews made me doubt the past two weeks when I reread the four earlier novels . Loved each of them . Loved FEAST FOR CROWS much more the second time around . DANCE WITH DRAGONS definitely develops the story moves us past A STORM OF SWORDS . This is RICH story telling with lots of background history and detail . Characters are developed . AND plot moves forward . Yes as with FEAST there has yet to be any big moments like the death of Eddard Stark the Red Wedding the fall of Winterfell but still the story is gripping . Reading DANCE in the immediate wake of the first four novels makes the newest novel so much better . Yes I still have lots to read . But I just had to contradict the negative reviews . The book is very much worth the read . Do not be daunted . Better yet . Reread what precedes DANCE and have a most remarkable reading experience.Now that I 've finished here 's my responseFirst I admitted to disliking writing an early review . But I justified it . There were simply too many negative reviews and had I listened to them I would have missed out on a remarkable reading experience.Second it would behoove any reader to reread FEAST or better yet the entire series before reading DANCE . Rereading allows the reader to identify all the character development and forward movement some of which is subtle that occurs in DANCE.Third I loved this book . Yes I can agree with many aspects of the negative reviews Tyrion does lose his zing yes Dany 's chapter 's go on a bit too long and yes all the single chapter POVs are a bit annoying . And yet Martin has moved his story forward . Ending with far too many cliffhangers again I agree ! but the only reason I am hanging on that cliff is because the story is so darn good ! As frustrating as the book could be at times it is LONG it was a remarkably rich reading experience . This is elevated fiction.Fourth I have a theory . The next book will be out within two years . Why ? It 's all about money making . Remember Martin told us he had written a large portion of DANCE at the time FEAST was released . He did NOT need six years to write DANCE . But he did need the time to wait for HBO to give him the larger deserved audience he and his publishers wanted . Have you seen the bestseller lists lately ? He sat on this . Worked on the next volume . And now we will see the final volumes released in a more timely manner . ",4
"Reading the death of one of my favorite characters in the series is never easy no spoilers here but this book is a good staging point to a climax yet to come . Ca n't wait to read about what happens next . Hope Martin releases the next book soon . ",3
"This review will provide hints about the book that some may consider spoilers . If you do n't want ANY plot information about the book before you read it you will not find this review helpful . It is meant for fans who want to know what they 're getting before they decide whether or not to invest time and money on this longawaited novel.So it 's finally here the excruciatinglyawaited fifth installment to George R.R . Martin 's I eat 'epic ' for breakfast A Song of Ice and Fire series . I am sure that most fans of Martin 's previous books in the series will already be familiar with the Meereen knot that was largely responsible for delaying this book all these years . What those fans will want to know is whether Martin was able to solve that problem . For those who do not know the Meereen knot is a reference to how many characters he apparently unwittingly sent to Meereen instead of sending Dany to Westeros . Getting them all out of Meereen and over to Westeros was apparently a big problem for him . Unfortunately the answer is a firm NO . He spends this entire 900+ page tome pulling diligently at its strings but in the end Dany while admittedly no longer in Meereen is still not demonstrably closer to conquering Westeros than she was in her last series appearance and she finds herself in a much weaker position to do so than at the end ofA Storm of Swords A Song of Ice and Fire Book 3 . In addition to that disappointment several of the myriad random characters who were on their way to Meereen because of Dany andor the dragons by the end ofA Feast for Crows A Song of Ice and Fire Book 4do n't even make it to her . So their stories still have to be straightened out and untangled and who knows how long that will take.Meereen and the doings there or leading up to getting there take up about half of the book and about a third is devoted to Jon Snow . His actions at the Wall are exciting to read as he makes extremely controversial decisions in order to prepare for what will obviously be an epic battle with the Others . We do n't learn anything new about the Others unfortunately but the pieces are in place for that battle when and if it does come . And his final chapter is the biggest cliffhanger in the book . Sadly there are a couple of obscure hints about his real identity but no solid information.Beyond these two main prongs the last fourth of the book is filled with a few chapters from old characters whose stories give us a brief glimpse of what is happening north of the Wall and far to the south of it with a couple of chapters peeking in on Arya in Bravos . Fans will be pleased to know that Bran finally gets where he 's going and even if he does n't do anything much of interest when he gets there the people he meets make for the most interesting additions to the ASoIaF world yet . Sadly no positive ID on Coldhands though . One token Jaime chapter gives us a major clue about Brienne 's cliffhanger ending in AFFC but he himself does n't do anything except mend some riverland fences . Cersei 's two chapters are satisfactory though they do n't answer any major questions about her ultimate fate and we even get a onechapter look at what 's happening in Dorne through the eyes of our old friend Areo Hotah . A leftfordead character takes us through most of what 's happening in the North without a Stark in Winterfell and we also get Asha Greyjoy as a POV character for the first time . We even get an answer to the question of whether that really was Davos whose hands and head were mounted by the Manderlys . The one major missing puzzle piece is the Vale . Sansa Stark does n't appear at all and there is n't a single character who sheds light on what Littlefinger might be getting up to or how his plots will ultimately impact the rest of the story . And one character we 've heard of but never formally met in anyone 's narrative gets his own POV to introduce a new major character who is either a big red herring or a complete game changer . Martin has already dropped hints that this person is just a red herring so it 's unclear why he chose to bring this guy in so late in the series and what his puzzling introduction will ultimately accomplish that actually benefits the main story.So on the whole is it worth reading ? Absolutely . If you 're a fan and you have n't given up on the series despite the delays you 'll want to read this for sure . And if it had n't been for the long wait between books I do n't think there 'd be QUITE as many naysayers for this novel . It 's not bad by any means . It 's a little disappointing because of what is left out and because of what does NOT happen but as long we do n't wait five more years or more ! ! to get those questions answered I think it 's an acceptable entry into the series . And an acceptable second half ofA Feast for Crows A Song of Ice and Fire Book 4 The finale is being framed for us but all we can see so far is a chunk of sky here some red and black blurs there nothing that gives us a real hint of what the finished jigsaw puzzle will look like . Based on Martin 's own interview comments in the months leading up to this book 's release he is well aware of the dangers of not providing a satisfactory ending to a series . I do n't think this book is any reason for fans to lose hope in his ability to ultimately deliver a satisfying conclusion with the seventh book . It 's engrossing and filled with great scenes . But as the fifth book in a series of seven it is responsible for laying the final major pieces in place as we start ramping up for the conclusion . At this point it 's impossible to say what all of those pieces are . Only Martin knows for sure and his fans will know that even after five years they can still trust him to do it right . ",2
"What happened to a Song of Ice and Fire.I still remember being gripped and hooked by the first three books in the series . The books were big but never long to read . I devoured the pages . Scenes still stick out in my head . I loved the way Martin confounded my expectations at every turn . How he twisted the characters and how the POV made everyone seem right . I enjoyed the way he turned Jaime Lannister around in a Storm of Swords . Martin was a writer at the height of his powers but then the inevitable fall began.The downfall started wtih Feast and it was a torrid bore . It felt big there was no tension there was nothing I could take away from the book . Dance I thought would be better but it too disappointed with everyone just walking from point A to point B. I could hardly believe that this was the same Martin who penned scenes like the Red Wedding . The introduction of the Direwolves set everything up wonderfully . In that one scene you knew who the characters were what sort of world this was . You knew that Jon Snow was a bastard one of the Starks and yet not one of them you knew that Eddard Stark was an honorable man . The entrance of the Lannisters was magnificently written . The twists just kept coming and all the while the writing was stellar . Tyrion just delivered . His wit and piercing insight into affairs made him everyone 's favorite dwarf . You could almost always feel the pain when Littlefinger spoke of Catelyn Stark . The story always moved forward . There was no room for standing still . Martin possessed this ability of introducing characters but you felt as if you had known them all along but the magic just vanished.Feast and Dance were soap opersa in which it made absolutely no difference if you skipped pages and scenes because you became reasonably sure that nothing of note would really happen . There was some memorable stuff but they were so scattered and so few in between that it was worse than trying to find a needle in a haystack.Worse than this was the fact that no mainstream publication seemed to take a stand and say that a Dance with Dragons was boring . Everyone was effusive . It was almost as if they had been paid to do a positive review or they did n't want to risk saying anything contrarian.Martin was on song in the first three books but he just seems to have lost his muse . I hope he rediscovers it in the Winds of Winter and keeps it focussed and stops it from meandering about.From ",1
"Game of Thrones was one of my all time favorite series when it first issued full of hope and promise in a unique world of not so courtly knights trumped by incestuous twins dragons and shapeshifters . Like Robert Jordan Wheel of Time Martin 's plotting skills are not up to his world building and Book 5 is the worst kind of Anticlimax full of enough foreshadowing to make the fate of the few survivors predictable . Kind of a core dump of unused backstory and long winded mico detail wrapped around limited plot advancement which consists mainly of wrapping up loose ends by ending their existence . Considering all that culminated in Book 4 this would be a good one to skip and see if Book 6 emerges and if so does better . ",1
"As with all his other books it is a well written fantasy novel with the perspective of several characters during the same time period . The characters are all very unique and if you know the series you will know all these characters already John Danny etc.. The whole series is gripping though not really recommended for the romantic fantasy novel reader as it really does n't have a thorough ground in that though does satisfy with the spitfire romances that usually end in death or betrayal . ",4
"This series is the very best I have ever read . My only complaint will be if The Winds of Winter is not released very quickly . Great read ! ",4
"I have been waiting for this fifth chapter anxious to follow these unforgettable characters hoping for some resolution . While this installment was somewhat satisfying I feel like I was invited to the feast and asked to leave before I could enjoy something like dessert or a conclusion as I had expected in Book Four . Again disappointment no more like anticipation for being able to catch upwith characters barely mentioned in this segment . What happened to Sam and the true Prince ? I realize that a work this detailed comes with a high price from the author . The detail the tangled plot line characters must overwhelm the author . He has done such a good job drawing me into this fantasy a firsttime trip for this voracious reader . I pray that sometime in the not so distant future he will satisfy my hunger for more . ",2
"This book filled in some of the questions that remained from Book 4 . It gave us a look at what was happening to several of the main characters . The characters are mostly charismatic and the reader truly wants to know what happens to them.I find it difficult to follow so many characters with only a chapter here and then again many chapters later . It is difficult also to see many of appear to be main characters killed off.I do applaud the intensity and degree of thoughtfulness that goes into the descriptions . Also love to see what is being thought and then what is actually said . ",3
"One of the things I really liked is that the author George R R Martin puts an incredible amount of detail into each character so you feel you actually know them . Some you will love and some not but just when you think you know what 's going to happen next there 's a twist throw in . Really keeps you going . My only problem with this book is that book six is n't written yet ! Oh what a let down . ",4
"I expected to enjoy this book and kept doggedly reading along in hopes a plot line which made sense would appear and pull the story together . It never did . It may be my fault as I did not read the earlier stories in this series . Perhaps I 'm out of line thinking that a book should stand alone . This one starts in the middle of events and ends in the middle of events without resolving anything . It jumps from character to character keeping the more unpleasant ones alive and suddenly killing off those which the reader has come to care about to no particular benefit to the storyline . I wasted quite a few hours reading this book thinking it would surely improve . Wrong . The author has talent but needs to turn his work over to an editor who knows how to weave a tale . ",1
"One of favorites in the series . Covers all the best characters . ",4
"If you do nothing else for the rest of your days make sure you read all the books in the Game Of Thrones series.They are the best books I have every read and the only books I have ever read twice . ",4
"I ca n't imagine why this book is getting the low reviews . I was so disappointed with the fourth book but felt the first three were so wonderful I just had to give him the benefit of the doubtand I 'm so glad I did . The action was relentless..the scope magnificent..and the plot intricate and nervewracking in a good way . Thank you Mr. Martin ! ",4
"While I would often express my frustration at the author and the pace of the series A Dance of Dragons taking over ten years to complete after the preceeding volume I always thought I had the book to look forward to . I hardly expected to be critical of the book the author maybe but not the book . After all THIS was the follow up to a Storm of Swords ! One of the best fantasy books written in my opinion and which I highly reviewed for Amazon.So no spoilers if you have followed this series you should read this ahm book that much is plain . There are a couple of gems within in terms of individual scenes and some surprisesanswers to set questions from the earlier books . But there is no overriding interest factor and two thirds of the way through the book it was clear that there was no reason to continue reading other than that I had read all the previous books in the series.At the rate Martin puts these things out recently anyway like one book every six years or so I will probably not read the next one in the series or I will wait till a day when I have the flu and it is in cheap paperback or kindle.After ten years of waiting with a excitement I no longer care a wit about the characters or the plots in this series . ",1
"I would give all the previous books in the series at least a 4 or higher and each one left me anticipating the next book . But this book has completely destroyed any interest I have in finding out what happens next in the series . This book goes absolutely NOWHERE interesting . It is like packing to go on a road trip but spending the entire trip going around in circles in a parking lot . Other reviewers have commented on the excessive details I do n't mind details if they add something to the story but too often the details just seem like filler was GRRM getting paid by the word ? . Too much time was spent on what the chracters ate or what they wore I 'm talking about you Dany and not enough time on what they thought or felt . I kept waiting for something to happen and everytime the story looked as though it were going to pick up steam see Reek it fizzled out like wet firecrackers . The other 4 books kept me up at night reading until the wee hours of the morning this one put me to sleep . ",0
"Another great book in the Game of Thrones series ! Loved the ending ! Ca n't wait until Jan 1st next year when the next book comes out . ",4
"I 've read all the other reviews . I understand why people are aggrieved . But frankly I 'm in absolute adoration of this book.Why ? Because while others have complained of no forward movement in the story no action no big battles and a lot of sailing horseback riding and other forms of ASOIAF travel I have to say that it 's exactly what a fan of worldbuilding like me was hoping for in the middle book of the series.This book along with its conjoined twin A Feast For Crows is the Order of the PhoenixTwo Towers of this world . And it 's the perfect time to give more detail on the other lands we have heard about but not met . Remember how the first book had you hating certain characters but by book 3 you knew them better and had perhaps grown quite fond of them ? This book does for the WORLD of ASOIAF what the first three books did for the characters . It lays it out in a travelogue style . Through the eyes of various voyagers we learn vastly more about the Free Cities The North and other parts of the ASOIAF globe.It 's a canard to say that nothing happens . Perhaps if you think things are only happening if there is much clanging of swords and shields and explosions of Wildfyre then yeah . Nothing happens . Instead there are many SOMETHINGS happening . Characters are developing . Political alliances that have lasted for centuries are being reshaped sometimes abruptly.This is not a loud boisterous bellicose book . This is a Maester 's sort of book a compendium of myth lore medicine politics . It 's the kind of book that I expect will make the cataclysmic wars in the last books more flavourful . Because now they will be set against a glorious tapestry not dropped into a void . I 'm sorry those who are more enthralled with action comics are disappointed . I am overjoyed . ",3

"My only problem with this book is the same as the prior books in this series Mr. Martin writes such generously sized books and writes them with such skill that I can not put them down . This means I read them for literally hours and hours on end . But what an enjoyable way to spend so many hours ! I can not tell whether I enjoy the characters more than the plots or vice versa . I feel I truly know these people . ",4
"A lot of characters but the story is a little loose . Still on his worst days George R.R.Martin writes a better book than almost anyone writing fantasy . I think that this could easily have been part of Book Four rather than a free standing Book Five . However I just read them not write them . Even if it is the weakest of the five it is still very good and worth every minute spent reading it . I am afraid that it will be a while for Books 67 and 8 . Too bad . ",4
"Luv this author . Great reading . Can hardly wait for the 6th book . Luv the HBO series . Long book but worth the time to read it from end to end . ",4
"I like this entire series..I am only disappointed that I have to wait for the sixth book to come out . I thought initially it was a 4 book series and when I finished I was stunned to realize it was n't finished ! So I purchased book 5 anticipating the finale ! Wrong again ! ! ! It is very difficult to read a series and have to wait so long for the last ? book to be published . Readers who have been following this Game of Thrones would like an conclusion not to be strung along for years and years waiting for the end . Unfortunately what sometimes happen is that we lose interest and never finish because it is too long between books . Just sayin ' . At least that 's how I feel ! I have become attached to some of these characters and feel terrible when they are eliminated and thrilled when they succeed . Let 's get book 6 out asap and get this Game finished . Thanks for a terrific ride so far ! ",4
"i am really tired of the Thrones . it almost feels like someone cowrote this last one . i like to read while i eat and the descriptions of death and mayhem are much more disgusting than the first four.Also he is adding new people and basically ignoring our old friends and enemies . i 'm half way through the last one thank goodness it is the last one and i 'm just not interested anymore but i 'll finish it because i 've spent too much time on it . ",2
"These books are consistently amazing . Like the others I could n't put it down . Looking forward to the next one . I love Jon Snow . ",4
"I read a lot of negative reviews on this book so was a little hesitant but ordered it anyway . Glad I did because it picks up on characters that are missing in the last book . When I read series books I have to read them all to see how it ends do n't like to be left hanging and wondering what happened . For me this is a good read so far a little slow but I believe it will get there eventually . ",4
"I find this book amazing . Its really creative imaginative descriptive . I had a really good time reading it . The way the writer describes the characters and places makes you feel like if you were there he makes you feel that you are part of the story looking at everything that is happening . ",4
"I enjoyed A Dance with Dragons much more than A Feast for Crows . I was glad to see my favorite characters return to the story Dany Tyrion Jon Snow however I really think the scope of Martin 's story has grown too broad . In the early books it was easy to see how Dany 's story related to the goingson in King 's Landing even though they were completely separate . Even though there were several different locations where the action took place and some of the characters never interacted I could imagine how eventually everyone might link up . After this book however I am truly not sure how Martin will manage to connect the different stories . There are too many secondary pointofview characters at this point in the series . I still enjoy the story but I have concerns . I also have concerns about the release of the sixth book since there were six years between the fourth and fifth books when Martin stated in the epilogue of FfC there would be a year . ",3
"A Dance with Dragons is the fifth book of the series . The last one was a bit slow and this one was a bit slower but I still enjoyed it and ca n't wait for the next book.I 've read some pretty hilarious and spoton criticisms of this book mostly that nothing happens . While this book does n't need to be as long as it is there are some excruciatingly elaborate descriptions of traveling through grass snow and river there is a lot happening here . A new villain emerges so much worse than Joffrey Cercei must deal with her imprisonment and new sides in the battle gather strength.Some of the chapters read like filler but it could be reasonably called character description . Martin is setting the stage here moving the cyvasse pieces around the board and getting us ready for the next installment.HBO will begin airing the next season at the beginning of 2014.Katie O'Rourke author of Monsoon Season ",3
"I WAS SO THRILLED TO FIND ANOTHER VOLUME AFTER READING THE 4 VOLUME SET THAT I COULD NOT WAIT TO GET MY HANDS ON IT . I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED . IT IS A TERRIFIC STORY THAT IS EPIC IN ITS QUALITY AS WELL AS ITS QUANTITY . I CA N'T WAIT FOR VOLUME VI . ",4
"I have read all in this series so far and this one was great . There was a lot of excitement in the plot . I ca n't wait for the next one . If you follow the TV show Game of Thrones I definitely recommend reading the books . ",3
"Right I 'm pretty aware that the author is not my servant but he has been our trusted guide through Westeros for some time . I think the audience has a right to be disappointed because the first three books were awesome and the long awaited CrowsDragons books do not deliver the same level of excitement anticipated . A lot of the dialog is just awful even for an adult book . I can handle reading these things I just do n't see how they add value to the story . Dialog is not supposed to be the punch line to every What 's Grosser Than Gross joke ever written . I remembered something while reading this book that once Mr. Martin decided to make this a five novel series he was having a challenge writing the backgroundmemories for what he eventually would put in Crows and Dragons . So the these books were n't even a part of the original plan and it shows . I actually do n't think it 's as horrible as everyone is making it out to be but I did cheat . I took another reader 's advice of skipping the Tyrion Jon Daeny and Quentyn POVs in the middle essentially sticking with Reek and Cersei . For those seeking to make the read more fun I recommend the Dance with Dragons drinking game take a shot every time you read the words neeps reek mummer 's farce and hodor . I read the first third of the book and thought it was a decent setup but I was very disappointed in the lifted Monty Python line if you find it take two shots . I enjoyed the last third of the book where I read all the POVs skimming through Quentyn 's and found the memories of what happened in he middle just as good . It is all setup toward the next book which I have a hunch based on the massive cliffhangers we 've been left with will be really awesome . The CrowsDragons books probably never should have been . My hope is that this is the long ascension building to continuing the final madness of the roller coaster ride this series began with . ",2
"I preordered this when it was announced as a second half.Since then I 've gotten married . I 've been deployed twice . I 've moved across the Atlantic and back twice . My eldest left high school the youngest went to prom . And host of other minor things.Somehow I expected a more from this book given the amount I 've done in same time.It repeats parts from the previous . It 's filled with details I do n't care about . And eventually just bores me . By time things were happening I was barely paying attention.When all was said and done it moved the story along but it was a rough noisy unnecessarily long ride . ",2
"Book 5 had many of the great qualities I found in books 14 but I had hoped for more closure with the key characters . So many strings were left hanging making me wonder if this book was really just a set up for the next book in the series.That being said he is a wonderful writer whose characters create indelible impressions on the reader . I would rate the overall series a 4 12 ! ",2
"Here 's a perfect example of what I ca n't stand about series books although he is very honest about it on the dust jacket . This book encompasses all the others . If you 've read them you 'll find the first half maybe more repetitive and slow going . Probably great if you have n't seen the show or read the serious . The die hard fans will be disappointed . ",2
"I have read all five in this series by George R.R . Martin and surely look forward to the next . Each book is a huge readI never want them to end ! ! ! They are exciting and complex with an outstanding cast of charters and locales . ",4
"I felt like I went to a great movie and had to leave 45 minutes before it was over . I never got to see the ending of the movie . George Martin spends way to much time on character thoughts and not enough time on the story . ",1
"George RR Martin does NOT disappoint and this 5th book in the Game of Thrones series is great ! If you 're looking for a good series to get hooked on..here you go ! And there is an HBO series as well ! ",4
"If you 've read the ASOIAF series you understand just how uniquely constructed and presented these books are . If you have n't and are in any way a fan of fantasy historical fiction andor simply something different in today 's world of nothing new under the sun entertainment you simply must give this series a try . ",4
"I 'm not sure what happened here . I can only guess that Martin has lost interest in this and is dragging himself through the pages on the whipping insistence of his editor.There are flashes of what I enjoyed in the first three books but those flashes are quickly snuffed by pages and pages of monotonous slush . Not even Tyrion can save this one.I 've learned a lesson here . If you start a series tell your story and finish it promptly . Do n't do this.King did the same thing with The Dark Towers series . Fool me once ",0
"AUDIOBOOK QUALITY REVIEW READ BY ROY DOTRICE Few months ago thought I would instead of reread the series listen to it . So I duly got all 5 books on audio and loaded them on my iPod . They were great companions for long walks and hikes and fishing ventures and what have you . Good quality no complaints transported me to Westeros as well as can be expected.At least the first 4 books where I had the good fortune to get the versions read by Roy Avers and John Lee did . Then I got to audiobook 5 A Dance With Dragons read by Roy Dotrice and I do n't know what genius decided to change readers but it was a ginormous brain frt . All the characters sound like they 're the age of Aemon Targeyan if he had a thick Scottish accent . All.16 year old Daenarys ? Sounds like a 90 year old Scott with throat cancer imitating what he misremembers women to have sounded like.Preteen Bran ? Sounds like a 90 year old Scott whining.Cercei ? Sounds like a 90 year old Scott male in one sentence then a 90 year old Scott drag queen the next and back and forth between the two in that vein.And conversations between characters ? Forget about it ! Audio does n't have quotation marks and G.RR Martin does n't do a lot of then Bran said `` or `` said Jon . In prior books the readers got around that by changing tone and pitch when switching from character to character . This book ? No change in tone or pitch or anything to let you know that the speaker changed . It 's just one jumble of an old gravelly voiced Scott and most of the time the listener has to guess from context who is talking.I hope there 's another audio version coming out read by either Roy Avers or John Lee or anybody else for that matter . If you 're buying the audiobook do yourself a favor and avoid the version read by Roy Dotrice . ",0
"I am baffled by all the 1 2 and 3 star reviews for this book . Especially about the 1 and 2 stars . I have read quite a few fantasy books and I can still say this book along with Feast is better than 90 % of the fantasy books out there . So how can you give it 2 stars ? The flow of this book is more like the pace of Feast with more likable characters shorter chapters for POV characters giving it a better flow than Feast and a bit more interesting.I believe that both Feast and Dance were middle books for this series but still are qaulity reads . ",3
"The book was a fabulous and each chapter a work that stands on it 's own.Only complaint is the story never stops or comes to a conclusion . What happens if this author stops writing these stories ? We 'll be left hanging with no resolve . That 's frustrating . ",3
"This book is a classic middle of the series type book . Nothing major happens . A few surprises for sure but so many loose ends it just feels like this whole book was designed to make us want the next book while the author figures out what to do next . This material could have been condensed to 500 pages with no major loss to the events that were told . As my 3 star rating implies it was OK but a long way from the better books that preceded it . ",2
"I read the first four books hardcopy and decided to try kindle for this one they are big and heavy ! This series is epic and gripping . Stating the obvious here . ",4
"Dance With Dragons is a good book and a worthy entry in the series.First I would like to say that many will disagree with this but a lot has happened here . The thing is you must understand that much of it takes place in the same timeline as ' A Feast For Crows ' and other than the last 250 pages or so does the story progress from that time . I understand why this would upset many people as they want the series to move forward as to what happens next however these events all have great relevance and for me made the previous 2 books that much better . I will not spoil the fun within but we learn of what some of the main characters have been doing or not doing since 'Storm ' and feeds into what could happen next which is what a good series is about . I look forward to the next 2 with great anticipation as I am now without a good series read and will have to see if Robert Jordan is as good or bad as others have proclaimed.In short if you have been pleased by the first 3 books and left shaking your head at the 4th do n't be discouraged by the bad reviews here get the book ! ",3
"The first three books in this series are fantastic . I loved every word . The fourth I struggled withand was very frustrated when NOTHING happened ! This was the same . So much was packed into the first three books and these last two could have been shrunk to a single chapter each.I wo n't buy any more in this series.I 'm moving on ",0
"I did n't get this book until a couple weeks ago I had read the earlier reviews and I thought wow it the book has to be better than others wrote . Well having read the book now I see a lot of validity in their comments . To rehash what was written would be a waste but yes no one of the main characters dies in this book they all keep getting out of fixes that the author keeps getting them into . It 's almost like there is a commercial coming so the author has to set up some difficult situation only to be resolved down the road a bit . Still Martin does tell a good tale and I am really liking the dwarf even if he did kill his father . Martin shows Tyrion in numerous difficult situations and keeping his wits about him still with the plague all about them it seems a bit much none of the leading characters catch anything . I am of course only talking about the dragon queen portion of the book not the Seven Kingdom majority of the book . Arya Stark is a bit much at times with her stubbornness most people would never have stayed blind once they realized they had the power to end it . I do n't think this book is as well written as some of the earlier ones but it is still entertaining and worth a read . ",2
"I want to yell at myself all the time for starting to read this series . The book is engrossing and frustrating . Chapters invariably end at a spot where I want to know more . But because I 've been waiting to read more about the previous scenes that were cut too short I keep flipping pages . And that 's how you go through 500+ pages in a sitting . Lucky I did n't put the kettle on before I opened the book . Like as not I 'd have burned the house down . ",4
"I 've been waiting for the release of A Dance With Dragons for six years . It would be hard for anything short of brilliance to live up to expectations after such a long wait yet ADWD still manages to disappoint.I believe the fundamental problem here is the same one that the late Robert Jordan ran into at around the seventh book point of his epic The Wheel of Time . Put simply the thought and care that the author puts into worldbuilding comes at the expense of plot development . And such attention to detail becomes extraordinarily draining as the smallest details become magnified and the cast of characters expands and collapses under its own weight . I appreciate the clearly extensive research that GRRM has put into all the different aspects of medieval life whether it be the clothing or the castles or the ships and so on . I just wish he would get on with the story.To give a concrete example I consider myself to be a diehard ASOIAF fan but I still have trouble making the distinction between Yunkai Astapor Meereen and the other locales in Essos . I simply ca n't bring myself to care about the characters that inhabit the region either . Unfortunately much of ADWD is devoted to the exploits of characters bearing names like Hizdahr Shakhaz and Yezzan who are not interesting or sympathetic . In my opinion one of the most compelling aspects of ASOIAF is the dynamic of rival houses with histories stretching back thousands of years each family tied to a geographical regionlandmark and the sigil of some creature with whom they are closely associated . None of this comes into play in the eastern continent where the storylines focus primarily on the tension between slavers and those opposed to it something I feel is welltrod ground in other literature . Reading about anonymous men described as wearing the masks of a lion locust and wolf is not very interesting compared to the ancient enmity between House Stark and House Bolton.GRRM does make some strides when it comes to working in the literary medium . I 'm referring mainly to his usage of the POV chapter headings as an indication of a character 's state of mind and selfperception . This is especially effective when it comes to the story of Theon Greyjoy . I would go so far to say that ADWD can be read as a selfcontained story of his character 's development set against the backdrop of larger events taking place in Westeros . In light of this improvement it is disappointing that primary POV triumvirate of Jon Daenerys and Tyrion are so flat despite them getting the meat of the book . Jon somehow is portrayed more more dourly dutybound than Eddard Stark in AGOT Daenerys ca n't seem to go anywhere while Tyrion is mobile but never ends up in the right i.e . more interesting for the reader place.ADWD is obviously a mustread for those who have been invested in the series from the very beginning but be forewarned that you will probably leave this Dance feeling hollow and unsatisfied . On the bright side the bar has been set fairly low for The Winds of Winter which we can all hope will offer more significant plot developments . ",1
"According to Martin 's foreword this book has a lot of content and a lot has gone on during and since the events of A Feast for Crows . He is right.There is so much going on in this book that you 'll find it hard to stop reading it.I wonder who he 's going to kill off next ? ",4
"Fifth of the Martin series continues with intrigue and unexpected twists . Ca n't wait for book six ! Hopefully sooner than later . ",4
"I find I mostly agree with the three and two star reviews . That said I 'm going with four because despite the extremely bloated story lines I actually still very much enjoyed the book and the writing . Really compared to anything else in the genre this is still a five star book . It has lost its way compared to the first three though and perhaps even the fourth.The problem as others have pointed out is that certain story lines and perspectives are beaten to death with endless chapters that never go anywhere . All of the various Mereen chapters got to be excruciating . That part became torture really I would actually set the book well Kindle really down and do something else never happened before with the rest of the series even AFFC.I 'm not done with the series as I said the quality is still incredibly high compared to other series . Many of the plot lines were engaging but as other reviewers pointed out they are drowning in a sea of chapters dedicated to over developed plot arcs that have become boring and frustrating in their excruciatingly slow development . Yes it is nice to savor a tasty meal but if you chew too long the flavor is lost . Mereen is stale gum that should have been spit out long ago . The North was even getting to that point but perhaps it can be saved in the next . ",3
"I 've been reading this out of sequence . There is so much info . It 's really freaking ' GREAT ! ! My daughter has started reading some . She loves them too ",4
"It has taken me more than a year to read these first 5 books and yet was in love right away . By far and above the very best series I have read . Riveting every moment from beginning to end . I am anxiously awaiting the release of The Winds of Winter . Thank you Mr Martin for being a brilliant writer and sharing this story with us ",4
"I can only second what many reviewers before me have remarked upon the book is far too long too wordy and too repetitive to stand in comparison to volume one to three.I think GRRM just is n't the same personality anymore that he was when working on the first three volumes . And although he always assured us that he was diligently working on AFFC first and then ADWD I think he has done about diddly squat in all that time . You just had to look at his NAB every few weeks NFL this and conventions that that 's all it was about . It 's all his life is about now I suppose.Then when that HBO deal came along the cunning salesman acknowledged an opportunity Hey lots of additional publicity ! So for the first time in years he sat down to really work a bit on ADWD only to find out that he had changed so much he could n't get access anymore to his own creation.To remedy that he wrote . A lot . Trying to immerse himself in the world and characters his readers wanted to hear about . Sadly all his efforts turned out to be just finger exercises . He does n't have a grip on the characters as he created them anymore . That 's why they all behave so strangely out of character imo.And he seemingly has no idea where to take the story he started . It was all clear once but now it 's muddled in his own mind . That 's what outlines are good for but GRRM is a freewriter a gardener not an architect . Moreover it 's been so long many readers have guessed the originally planned grand revelation J=R+L . So out of the lunch box comes young Griff just to show these pesky readers that GRRM is alwasy good for a surprise . It all feels forced added on and not thought through.Even the prose is different now much coarser many and more repetitions archaic expressions and catch phrases.I did n't buy this one in fact I cancelled my 2008 preorder as soon as I was informed the book would be ready for delivery in two weeks time so appalled was I by his conduct on the NAB water damaged goods anyone ? . And I wo n't bother with the next if ever it should come out in my lifetime . I do n't want the characters and storyline that I once loved spoiled anymore in my mind than he has managed to do with this clunker of a book . ",0
"After finishing the slow trainwreck that was A Feast For Crows which immediately followed three of the best fantasy books I have ever read I was hopeful to see the series get back to its roots . I understood that due to the damn dragons a time skip or period of danys being off screen would be needed . What I did n't know was that George would handle it in the worst way possible . Except in Theon 's case he seems to be ignorant to when letting a character linger in shadows is appropriate and when it is not.Brienne for example brought us nothing but a cliffhanger in book 4 when she could have gone without a POV or two chapters max.In Dance the number of pointless chapters is disgusting.Surely the master who wrote Game of Thrones could nestle Tyrion into the story again in an interesting way ? But all of his chapters amount to nothing and I confess I skimmed the later half of them . He went from the best character in the series and some of fiction to being annoying and negligible.Aegon came out of nowhere and while Griff is interesting his arrival was unwelcome amongst so many stale POV's.Arya has fallen from grace like Tyrion and for two books has been a bore . All we needed was a chapter of her entering training and then when we see her when training is done a brief recap instead she pollutes countless pages in both books.Dany is so painstaking only around 4 chapters were passable . The rest were atrocious bores.Jon had a strong intro in the book but it deteriorates when time is spent on irrelevant aspects of the NW and his POV ends with what was foretold at the beginning of the arc biting him in the ass with an obvious cliffhanger.I confess I wanted to see frankengregor defend Cersei in this book but instead we get her long drawn out suffering . But I wont say that is bad.Victarion is a beast but accomplishes nothing and did n't need to be included as such.Asha is annoying at this point and I had hoped she died when we first saw her in this book.Bran has been in a similar boat to Arya though his journey has been long and dragged out . Luckily this book gets him to his goal in some of the more interesting chapters . But where his character will go is unclear and has been for 5000 pages . I do n't think GRRM knows himself.Quentyn is the funniest character due to the fact he was such a silly addition to the story . I did n't know why he had come in and just wished he would die . His Oh thought as he got roasted was actually awesome and made his few chapters ultimately hilarious despite being wastes of paper.I ca n't say it was all bad.The prologue was amazing and if the others actually did something in the book it would have been an incredible set up and tone setter . Much better than AFFC 's garbage intro to which I am also convinced George created without a reason . But I digress.Davos is still pretty cool and meets some neat people.Theon out of nowhere is the best POV in the story though even he could have done with one less chapter.Melisandre as a POV made me grin though its unfortunate it goes nowhere.Barristan is awesome too but Mereen feels so much like a filler area I am hard pressed to care.The epilogue is great except that it makes me yearn for another installment a real one . Which may never come.George still writes great but it is so clunky and bogged up that it makes the crappy POV 's unbearable and the good ones tedious . Another reviewer made a great point that in AGOT that Cats journey to Kings landing was not several chapters . It happened hastily because there was an end goal to be reached and the journey was not a significant element . However in ADWD EVERYONE is stuck in the stasis of a journey.Imagine if AGOT spend 3 chapters for the trips of Cat to and from Kings Landing that when the Khalasar ventured to their conquests the journey was documented . That on the way south from Winterfell the trip before and after the Joffery incident were written in detail . You get the idea.These meaningless journeys prefaced by cliffhanger endings are n't needed in the first books because there IS a destination . Martin knew where we were going and was excited to get there . That is the core problem with the plot and pacing of the series.As far as the main flaw in the writing formula the whole description description description CLIFFHANGER routine is seriously getting old with the previously mentioned problem . There are cliffhangers just for the sake of being cliffhangers so much to the point that nothing happens in the meat of the chapters . I kid you not only about five chapters have anything truly interesting happen before the last paragraph . This is doubly offensive when it is a false flag character death . Tyrion obviously was n't going to drown Davos obviously was n't going to be killed Brienne obviously was n't going to be killed most annoying Jon snow obviously is n't dying like that . For a heartbeat I though Quentyn was going to come back and I would have needed to burn the book.The final problem and the most infuriating is that every bookalthough the first 3 could justify it and had some big event or resolution builds up and leaves a plethora of cliffhangers . In 1 and 2 especially it was done well enough that you could imagine just enough and smile at what you thought might happen but in 4 and 5 it all just feels random.IF the next book actually cuts the filler and brings home a legitimate story that cuts the cheap tactics and redeems the seemingly lost causes like Arya and Bran and gets Dany and Tyrion back on the right track we will have the makings of an epic with a sluggish middle . Otherwise this will be one of the worst series ever and a legendary bait and switch . ",1
"I totally loved the 1st 3 books hated the 4th and was dreading the 5th but it was a good recovery . Although I did n't enjoy this one as much as the 1st books I did like it a lot . It moves along so much better than the 4th book . ",3
"When and if a new book in this series comes out I 'll wait for it to be available at the library if I even bother . This book covered so many characters most of whom I did not remember or care about . It is a continuation of book 3 and runs in parallel to book 4 . Book 3 came out eleven years ago which is too long for me to remember . This book does not wrap anything up and Martin has an annoying habit of killing the few major characters we actually care about . ",1
"Yes I too wish the story had 200 more pages to move the story closer to its conclusion though better yet why not the 2000 to 5000 more pages it will take to finish this . Even with book yet another stepping stong toward its conclusion its a very impressive masterpiece of a book in a series which is the best fantasy series ever . If GRRM croaks before his masterpiece is complete I will kill him myself ! Wanting more is really what the impatient folks are complaining about which is the best thing any author can hear . I loved this book . I love this series . Yes I want more though not to the point where I have to knock stars off the rating because its taking longer than I would like . This is a large book though the times flies by reading it and the end comes way too quick despite it 's mega length . It takes a great book to suspend time like that . Hence my 5 star rating . Greaqt job GRRM please keep on a rolling ! ",4
"I have been waiting impatiently for this book for a LONG time but I feel like it is taking me twice as long as I spent waiting just to plow through this book . The characters are still very interesting but not a lot is happening in Dance of Dragons . I 'm about 85 % of the way through the book but the story line has n't been advanced by much at all and I 'm pretty sure that this series ca n't be concluded without a lot more books if they are all going to be this slow . And sorry Mr. Martin I do n't want to wait as long as it would take for you to write that many more books ! Also the book has a lot of typos especially the word then when than should have been used . Sloppy editing but I 'm pretty sure it would n't have been so irritating if I had been less bored . ",1
"I wo n't wax philosophical and in great detail as to why this was a disappointment too many others have done it much more eloquently than I could . Not only did I buy the ADwD book I downloaded the Kindle version so I 'd never be without it until I finished it . Never again . If GRRM ever does release another installment I 'll come here and get the Cliff Notes and read the reviews before depositing another penny on this series . I thought perhaps AFfC was an abberation and surely this one would make up for it.Let me also add that I 'm a very forgiving person for authors regarding timelines for releasing books and the occasional story dragging a bit . When I decide to buy a particular author or series I buy and collect them all . So for me to give this highlyanticipated book 2 stars and to feel strongly enough to voice my disappointment is a rarity . I 'd have given it one star but I really like the cover and it looks good in my library . Just so . ",0
"I 'll be brief I wholeheartedly disagree with everyone who has said that this book is insufficient lame short boring or whatever . Martin simply outdoes himself in every possible way in this book which is huge and deals mostly with some of his and mine favorite characters . Tyrion outdoes himself again in being hilarious Daenerys faces maybe her worst challenges yet and Jon Snow goes overboard as Commander of the Watch with overly ambitious plans . The story not only completes that of the previous volume but actually advances in the last third or so.With the story now poised for an exciting climax I personally hope that Martin can start wrapping things up and not pull a Robert Jordan on us ",4
"I cheated and basically watched Game of Thrones and Clash of Kings on HBO 's series . I 've read storm of swords feast for crows and I 'm 12 way through Dances with Dragons . Storm of swords was excellent and feast for crows was a nice change of pace but now I must confess that either I 'm losing interest or the story line is getting tiresome . George Martin is a brilliant writer very detailed and descriptive a little too descriptive in my mind . There are some very exciting events that take place in the book but it takes 100 pages of background information and descriptions of characters and scenery to get to it . ",2
"The lovely saga of the Starks continues as Martin skillfully weaves plot lines in this newest chapter of the Game of Thrones series . The clash of evil against good heats up as dragons take to the air with treachery at every turn . If only Ned could see how it all unfolded . Deservedly addicting . Thanks Mr. Martin for another chapter in this rollicking adventure . ",4
"Noticeably dragged out and forced in some parts but you 'll read it just based on the inertia from the forst four books . ",3
"The book shipped quickly although there were a few dusty fingerprints on a few of the pages when I received the book . . Otherwise it is a great read and well worth the money if you want a book with twists and turns and a well developed political system . ",4
"My only concern is how long it has taken Mr. Martin to write subsequent novels . I am in limbo waiting for the sixth book . His characters are so engaging . I am thrilled also with the TV series . The choice of the actors to portray his characters are excellent especially Peter Dinklage as Tyrion . It is a very tough role to play . I was concerned at first but now in the third season I am so impressed that I have no fingernails left ! When will the sixth novel be out ? ",4
"I was very sad to learn half way through the book that the next book and some of the ragged ends is still not even finished . I 'll need a refresher course by the time the next book is published . This is a disservice to your readers Mr Martin . ",3
"Read this book in one whole day . Waited forever for it and will probably start rereading Book 4 before reading this again . Highly addictive . This book in particular has me wondering when Danni will take over the world ! ",4
"One of the best book series I 've ever read ca n't wait for book 67 & 8 . The HBO series brings the many characters and dragons alive . I still encourage the tv show watchers to also read the books . If you are looking for that great escape with a never ending story this is the book series for you . Enjoy . I know I did . ",4
"I think this is a great series I love his writing style and the dark gritty scenes . He is a master at his craft . Series may have slowed some but after reading Robert Jordan 's Dragon Reborn series I am used to a lull in some books and think the overall piece speaks for itself . ",4
"A huge improvement from the last book . A lot more dragon & dire wolf action . As usual there are a few disappointments but as always I only want to start reading the next book . ",4
"Well written as usual if a bit spastic with the character jumps . Though if you made it this far in the series you should be used to that by now . Now for the long wait til the next book ",3
"My breath is gone and my heart is racing fast and All I can say is & # 8220The game is afoot & # 8220 ",4
"GRRM set a very high standard with the first three novels in this series . It 's significant that he published those initial books in a fouryear period . In the eleven years since then he has completed two books both of which were disappointments to many readers.The previous installment A FEAST FOR CROWS improved on a second reading . Except for the sequences with Brienne AFFC had brisk pacing and plenty of plot.ADWD is much longer and feels really really long . I got about halfway through and felt like nothing had really happened . With the first three books I could n't put them down . I took time off work and read for hours at a time unable to break away and get interested in anything else.With ADWD by contrast I actually starting looking forward to finishing it . I was constantly flipping ahead to see how many pages were left in the chapter I was reading and came very close to skimming in several places . By the end I wanted more but that 's because the story was finally getting exciting and I knew I 'd be left hanging.There is just too much detail too many incidental characters and no real sense of events coming together . It 's more a collection of linked vignettes than a novel . Martin is casting his net too wide many of the subsidiary characters would be better dealt with in a series of short stories that could be published separately . Dorne the Ironborn and Brienne would be good candidates for this treatment.However Martin wants to include everything and this more than anything else probably accounts for the long time it 's taken him to get this far . He has so many balls in the air that it 's difficult to focus . This book is a vast sprawling outofcontrol mess that needs a good editor . I halfexpected to see a POV chapter entitled THE KITCHEN SINK.Hopefully if he 's able to regain control of his material he 'll be able to finish the next book before Doomsday and he can start bringing the disparate threads of the plot together . ",2
"Just like everyone else I have waited a long time for this book . I did n't cry hibernate send hate mail or moan about the wait . I 'm not a writer have no aspirations to be one or know the difficulties involved . That being said I do read a lot a really huge amount of the printed word on paper goes into my head on a daily basis . I feel that this book was more than half nothing but filler fluff and crap . Just being paid by the page were you George ? So much of this book was repetitious inane boring hey did n't we just cover that ? nonsense . Need I go on ? No I need n't . I am not being paid by the word . A book that I was anticipating eagerly which should have been devoured in under two days took me the better part of a week it was so boring . Perhaps George or I will live long enough to see the end of the series perhaps not . I 've found with this last installment I really do n't care about the series anymore . If and when it comes out I 'll put it on hold at the library . ",2
"Incredibly well written and suspenseful ! Great followup to previous books in the series . Ca n't wait for the next one to see what happens ! ",4
"I was going to give three stars because of the first three books how could I give this book only two but when you look at it there is no resolution to anything . a story spun out so that the dragons can grow is about all it comes down to.Throughly disappointing 900+ pages and no ending to anything . It seems as if George and his editor sold out to Hollywood back in Feast for Crows.I will not be rereading this and it has put me of rereading the first three hell I may even have to let my friends know how bad it is.George your not getting any younger I suggest a new editor one that will put you back on track . Let the next book be the finish of it sell the franchise if you want money and write something else cause this Game has been played out . ",1
"I so enjoy these books . This style of book is one of my favorite genres . Mr Martin takes so long between books but in my opinion they are worth the wait ! ",4
"SPOILERS After the previous books abysmal existence I still had faith going into the fifth book of A Song of Fire and Ice series . Now that this mammoth book has been read I still have faith in the series but it is very microscopic at this point.The only good news really about this book is that my two favorite characters are back Tyrion and Daenerys . It was their stories that really kept me going and even with them in it all the other fillers put me to sleep on more than one occasion . I honestly do n't care about Jon any more but it seems Martin may have killed him off anyway another thing I hate all these cliffhangers with no answer on whether people actually die or not . Davos 's story did n't really have an ending in fact I do n't think he made an appearance after 400 pages . Same with Bran do n't really know where his story is going I think he lacks any more appearances after 450pages . I believe Martin forgets to add more chapters about the said characters above when he writes his books . By the time the book gets published he says Oops forgot to add more stuff on Branand Davos . Oh well.At the end of this book the same for the previous one all the characters take one step forward but by the end of it they 've taken three steps back . If the series still has two more books before the end I honestly ca n't see how Martin is going to finish the tale unless he just kills off everyone at the end in a spectacular blood bath . He is not going to give the fans what they want I fear and that is exactly how Charlaine Harris 's career ended for me with her Sookie Stackhouse series . I even had the tiniest amount of sympathy for Cersei and Theon in the end . Shame ! Shame on you Martin ! The rating is four stars but just barely and perhaps only because the first three books were phenomenal . Let 's hope with the release of the sixth book in Gods know when the percentage of the series does n't get reduced down to 5050 . ",3
"Why oh why does n't George Martin bring the series to a conclusion rather than spinning out more and more meaningless subplots ? A Song of Ice and Fire started out with interesting characters and a compelling storylineI thought the first 3 books were amazing . Unfortunately it got stuck and went from fluid to frozen . Maybe that is why the Stark 's motto Winter is coming has always been so prominentthe author was warning us that the story would become frozen before it was finished.I hope the next books bring life back into this originally interesting series . If not they will just add more confusion to a series that has become tedious and boring . ",1
"I completely enjoyed this book . How much you enjoy it will depend a lot on what you as a reader look for in a novel . This is a rich detailed story and it spends a lot of time on building the world and its characters . It is true that the overarching story of the series progresses little in this installment and if that is the main attraction for you then you are going to be frustrated by this book . I totally understand . Many people were hoping certain longrunning questions might be answered such as Jon Snow 's parentage or that the looming threat of an invasion by the Others might begin . Instead this book gives us questions and cliffhangers and a lot of character journeys that never quite reach a destination . But if what you come to this story looking for is a wonderfully textured part of a longer journey then there is so much here to appreciate and love.After reading A Feast For Crows where we were only treated to half of the character perspectives this novel picks up at the end of A Storm Of Swords telling us the other half of the story . This is the story of Jon Snow Tyrion and Daenerys . But there are other stories here too and some even more interesting than these main characters . I found myself unexpectedly cheering on a character that previously I had nothing but loathing for and watching with fascination as the other players make their moves in the grand scheme of the story.Up on the Wall Jon Snow has been named the 998th commander of the Night 's Watch . After centuries of fighting the dangerous people known as the wildlings that live north of the wall Jon begins to reach out to them in peace as the threat of a far greater enemy draws ever nearer . His unpopular decisions strain the Night 's Watch even as King Stannis places ever greater demands on him in his attempt to unify the North under his rule . I was very fond of Jon Snow 's chapters . He has never been my favorite character but he 's one of the most honorable men in Martin 's world . But as a leader he is forced to make gray choices in an attempt to save lives and maybe the entire realm . His arc has been more interesting since his time among the wildlings and never more than now.In the east Tyrion flees his sister 's wrath and makes his way toward the rumored Dragon Queen Daenerys . Since the beginning of the series Tyrion has always had his noble family name and wealth at his back now stripped of these he is forced to make do as just another dwarf in a world where the strong have no use for the weak . Along the way he will uncover a secret that may well unbalance the entire game of thrones in the west.Daenerys now rules in the east but her rule is a fragile one . She has the might of an army and the only three living dragons in the world but her attempts to end slavery have turned the hearts of the people against her . She tries to become the leader she was born to be but discovers that the cost of a crown is a dear one . I was hoping to see a little more movement in Dany 's chapters but the character frustrates me sometimes much as I love her . Her quest to regain the throne of Westeros has stalled . But her struggles had my whole attention even as I wished she had a certain cynical dwarf around to give her an irreverent hand with things . Her dragons are growing . No longer are they the cute mascotcharacters of the series . With one horrifying moment they are revealed to be true monsters perhaps beyond control . Dany also gets the absolute best moment in the story which I 'm not going to spoil for you here.The writing is excellent as always . This is a story for people who like their fantasy worlds with lots of detail . Nowhere is this more apparent than in the characters themselves . I mentioned earlier that a certain character I used to hate had my love this time around . I wo n't tell you who it is but his story was probably the most emotionally compelling of the whole book . Even more than the world with its dragons and magic and undead terrors Martin 's characters are what shines in his stories . Even the ones you hate have you watching their arcs with fascination unable to look away . Roose Bolton and particularly his unholy monster of a son are terrific villains the kind you just keep watching and waiting for them to get what they deserve.For a book that is criticized for not progressing the story very much a lot happens . The dragons that used to be almost cuddly become real horrors . A young princess continues her dark training . A onceproud prince tries to rise from the ruin his life has become . An old knight tries to solve a deadly mystery . A priestess does whatever she can to aid the one she believes will fulfill an ancient prophecy . Jon Snow tries to make peace with the wildlings in the face of a greater evil . Dany rules as a stranger seemingly turning her back on her destiny . A prince and a pirate both journey along different paths in search of the dragons and their beautiful queen . Tyrion also seeks out the young queen in the hope that she will help him achieve his own vengeful purpose . A couple of Freys get exactly what they deserve in one of the book 's subtler moments . A young boy journeys into the deep north led by a dead man . And a master manipulator finally shows his hand . There is also a lot of action and mayhem love and death . Not a single page is wasted if you can appreciate it . And I think you will.If I was ranking this among Martin 's other books I would probably put it somewhere in the middle . It is much better than A Feast For Crows but not quite at the level of A Storm Of Swords . And for the most part it is telling the other half of the story in A Feast For Crows so not every character I love made an appearance this time around . This makes it feel a little incomplete in that parts of the story are being ignored . But the story it does tell is so richly told and engaging that I really did n't miss the rest that much . And in a pleasantly surprising move the stories start to catch up to each other near the end so a few unexpected characters make appearances for which I am very thankful . Happily even my favorite character showed up for a couple of chapters which I did n't think was going to happen this time around . If I were reviewing this book in comparison to the rest of the series I would probably give it 4 or 4 and12 stars since it is not the best but still very good . And there are moments in it that rival the best moments in the entire saga . But when I compare it to the rest of the books I 've been reading this year and to fantasy literature in general then it stands far enough above what 's out there that it deserves nothing less than 5 stars . It 's a great book . Not the best in the series but an imperfect novel in this series still stands above almost anything else in fantasy you are going to read this year . This is easily the best work of fantasy I 've read this year and I do n't expect it to be surpassed until Martin releases The Winds Of Winter next summer I can dream ca n't I ? . It is a beautiful chapter of a terrific fantasy epic and I loved it.Final Grade A ",4
"Bought it in hardcover but it is so large that I went with a Kindle edition because I could n't hold it for long enough to read . Sometimes Martin 's near obsession with endless goofy names and a parade of seemingly random characters is exasperating and appears to add needlessly to the length but stay tuned .. by golly it all comes together in the end and what an incredible tale he tells ! You 've never been anywhere like the Seven Kingdoms and never will not even in your own imagination outside of this remarkable saga . To say that it has everything and more is an understatement . And there is a tremendous sense of accomplishment when you are done .. I finished Ice and Fire .. something akin to having joined a special club the Mt . Everest Pinnacle Climbers . Of course no one starts with book five so you know all of this anyway . ",3
"This book continues the great saga of a world at war . There are so many main players that it is a difficult book to set aside for a week and then continue without having to think now who is this again ? There are many minor charactures that Martin follows who he then kills off one way or another only to replace them with another minor characture . Not that the main players are safe as we found out with the young wolf and his father a couple of books back . The breadth of this novel is truely remarkable . The charactures are endearing . The story is facinating . This is not a stand alone book ! Highly recommend this series . ",4
"George R. R. Martin 's A Song of Ice and Fire series never fails to whisk me away to another world . I get so wrapped up in it . A Dance With Dragons is no different from the previous books in its ability to do that . I 'm by no means a literature critic I just enjoy a great book every now and then . This is raw brutal and fantastic . ",4
"Great books for summer or any time reading .Love the way he moves through the various chapters and story lines . I have only one book left to read in the series with the next book due out in 2017 and the last one in 2023 ! ! ",4
"Martin pulls one surprise after another and man a great many shockers in the last 100 pages . Bring the 6th book out please can hardly wait ",4
"In some ways not satisfying as it feels a bit like a bridge between two novels it is well executed and left me wishing for the next installment . ",3
"I want to hate this series but alas I could n't put this fourth book in the series down until I turned the last page . ",3
"In all fairness the last book was good but there were no Dany or Tyrion chapters two of my favorite characters . Dance of Dragons brings you up to date with them as much as one can get up to date with any of these characters . ",3
"I ca n't wait for the next one to come out ! ! I hope that certain people are still alive in the next one ! ",4
"A Dance with Dragons by George R.R . Martin a Kindle book I read while yup taking a roadtrip to Yellowstone Park particularly during longer spans of driving around mountains to avoid the urge to look vertigoishly off the edge.Being I last read a Martin book months and months ago and finished off the second season of the HBO drama a week or two before I did n't think I was going into this book too unassisted but it still took me a couple chapters to readjust and realize who 's in the book and who is n't what timeframe this all is happening in and if people have really met their demises or not word to the wisefans of this series never take the The sword came down and then the world went black phrasing at the end of someone 's chapter to heart . This latter bit of info worked against me while I was with my boyfriend in the car and I 'd blurt out something or swear and he 'd in his HBOdramaonly knowledge of the books say What ? What happened ? and I 'd give away information that wo n't happen for a season or two . Somehow he still let me stay in the car . ",3
"I hope it wo n't be another 5 years for the next book ! Martin knows how to keep his audience entralled ",4
"but it 's still 5 stars . Now if GRRM would get the last couple books done with I can rest . Just do n't croak on us before they are done please ! ! ! ! ",4
"It is written as well as the earlier books and you never know what 's going to happen next or who 's going to survive to the next chapter.I hope Book Six is out in a reasonably timely fashion ",4
"The story rambled and left you hanging at the end . I think the author got burned out with the story and just wanted to end it . ",2
"Having now finished reading all five volumes of A Song of Ice and Fire I find myself frustrated like many others at the glacial pace how ironically appropriate of the plot development or at least any significant plot development . For make no mistake George Martin has a unbridled penchant for weaving interminable plot expansion with infinite character development until your ready to scream Enough ! Yet somehow it manages to hold your interest through five thousand some pages though that interest in now being sorely tried as things drag on and on and on.I am also beginning to tire of the horrific world Mr. Martin has created . It appears to have no redeeming social moral or other value other than titillating one 's libido or vicariously satisfying one 's blood lust . It is next to impossible to really like or identify with any of the main characters with the possible exception of Jon Snow and Arya . This contempt or is it cynicism disguised as realism certainly separates Martin from the likes of Tolkien and Brooks and most other fantasy writers of note . It does work in the first three books but is beginning to wear by volumes 4 and 5 . One begins to hope the dragons will level the whole fracking place ! ",1
"I do n't know how I 'll be able to wait another 2 + years for book 6 . This book leaves you with so many cliff hangers ! ",4
"This book is by far not the best in the Game of Thrones series but it was still good . It did drag in parts and I did struggle a bit to finish it but I did . Oh John Snow what ever will we do without you ? And Cersei you were so humiliated but you totally deserved it . I do think that Cersei is just putting on a good girl face and will come back with vengeance in the next book If it ever gets written . Get on it GRRM ! I put too much time into this series to get left hanging ! ",3
"I consider myself ripped off after receiving this book . I should NOT have pre orderedwill not make this mistake again . This book seems to be edited out material that was thrown together to take advantage of the huge interest generated by the HBO series . I doubt the author ever meant to finish this series but saw the huge paycheck that he would get if he churned out another book . Last book I will buy from this author and last book I will ever preorder . ",0
"So sad to have finished this book ! Great read ! Can not wait for George Martin to finish writing the next book ",4
"What can I say ? In the may came a masterpiece the quality of the book is really good a hardcover that feels good to have and cary arround . The work of Martin is awesome as allways the world the characters all is great . Waiting for the winds of winter . ",4
"A little slower in the beginning but it all comes together nicely in the end.Excited to see what happens next in a few years from now ",3
"This book brings together so many of the loose threads from the end of Book # 4 . I was disappointed in the turn of events for some of my favorite characters but others live on & the struggle continues . For me it 's always difficult to wait for the next book to be written . At least the series is back w Season 3 even tho the books give you so much more detail & insight into the lives of each of the characters . Waiting for Book 6 ! ! ",4
"I love this whole series . Yes there are a lot of characters to keep track of but the story is about a war of seven kingdoms so I think that the amount of characters keeps it realistic . Martin does a good job of reminding us who these characters are if we tend to forget thorough conversations with other characters . I was also very happy to see that my favorite characters were back tyrion jon arya ! Ca n't wait to see what happens on book six ! ",4
"I have n't finished the book so far but it is the fifth book in A Game of Thrones and has so far met all expectations . These are n't the great books ever written but they are n't the worst either and are very entertaining . ",4
"The 5th book wasnt what I expected enjoyed reading it and couldnt put it down cant wait for book 6 ",3
"Again nothing happened ! You ca n't have a thousand page book with only a few major things happening . I am frankly slightly nervous where ASOIAF is headed at this point . Taken by themselves book 4 and 5 are reasonably entertaining reads but back to back they have to be given a very anxious asterisk that they might be a harbinger of a drop off in the series . To me it seems like Martin has one huge plot point that he 's pushing off because there wo n't be much to write after it happens coughwinterWe 'll see . I still love the series but I was ultimately disapointed with this most recent one . ",2
"A Dance with Dragons is the long anticpated fifth book in the series A Song of Ice and Fire . Overall I enjoyed the book . I think it is a notch below the first three books in the series and onpar with the fourth book which I also rated three stars . I personally think a strong editor could have cut the slow parts observed in both books and produced a single solid book to tell the story.Most likely people reading this review are familiar with the story line by now so I 'm not going to go into the details of what takes place in this book . I will note the reasons I ranked the book down two stars.I ranked it down one star because it felt like the story really dragged at times as it spent so much time in Mereene but nothing really happened there . Dany 's dragons got bigger but we did n't progress the story much . It seemed like this entire portion of the story was in a holding pattern while other parts of the story progressed.I ranked it down a second star because Martin is going to the well a few too many times with characters that are dead or appear to be dead coming back to life . I would n't be surprised if Eddard Stark somehow rises from the dead or makes a ghost appearance in a future story ! One other annoyancesurprise was Martin further complicating the plot with the introduction of a completey new set of characters to compete for the crown . It will be interesting how he ties all of these plots together and I am hopeful it wo n't take another long wait before we find out what lies ahead for the Seven Kingdoms ! ",2
"As some have already started this book I a lot of filler . That however does not make it a bad read . It 's still enjoyable but in the end the cliff hanger leave you dying for more . ",3
"I have read the 1st 4 books in the series and could n't wait for this book . They are long and have so many characters but I still love them . The fact that you have to wait from chapter to chapter and book to book makes the books very hard to put down . I love books that take me back to my bed several times a day to read and this one does that . ",4
"I have my own imagery of the world but the more I read about the show the more I think I 'll watch itbut reading the books well do read them and enjoy the show all the more . ",4
"Wow is one word if I want to describe my feelings after finishing A Dance with Dragons ! ! You get to travel with your favorite characters that you love or love to hate through remarkable journeys that take your breath away . Your favorite characters dissapoint you again with bad decisions . The characters you hated surpise you making you feeling bewildered and confused about them . You meet less recognized characters that now play important roles in the development of the story . You get to know more about different people exotic places and cultures about mysterious Children of Forrest and Giants . .and much much more . This book is almost magical . I loved it and can not wait to see what happens in the next book . ",4
"I would have to say it is worth waiting until they drop the price to 8.99 . Really it is not a must read . ",1
"Gosh this series is just one of the best things I have ever read in my lifetime . You will miss alot if you watch the series excellent as well you must do both ! ",4
"A Dance with Dragon is a sprawling tome of epic proportions that further expands the A Song of Ice and Fire universe but does not provide any resolutions to the plethora of dangling plot threads from the previous books . It helped reading Dance with Dragons on the heels of A Feast for Crows since gave me a clearer picture of the parallel story arc . Yet with so many pending questions cliffhangers resurrections and prophecies A Dance with Dragons felt fragmented and unfocused . I was especially frustrated that Dany and her dragons seem to be perpetually stuck in political quagmire . I really hope with the next book that Dany and the dragons get moving I 'm sick to death of the stagnant Meereen storyline . I want to know who will ride the three dragons for the second dance with dragons.Nevertheless I found myself fully engrossed with the intrigues of the feudal medieval world of Westeros and it was good to see some favorites characters again . I especially enjoyed the aftermath of scheming powerhungry Cersei 's public humiliation and I was blown away with the revelations of Varys true motivation . At this point there are still a handful of characters left that I hope and root for Daenerys Bran Jon Snow Aegon Arya and Davos . I also want to stick around in case the Lannisters Boltons and Freys will get their comeuppance sooner rather than later . Now I join the long line of waiters for the sixth book in the series The Winds of Winter and hope that the next book will move towards a coherent ultimate ending . ",3
"another excellent book in this series . Im in awe of how Martin weaves so many different strands together and keeps track of so many characters and plots . I do hate how he keeps killing off my favorite characters though and I 'm annoyed that I will have to wait ages for the next book . ",4
"George R.R . Martin writes an excellent story and I ca n't stop reading his books . He certainly knows how to bring out the emotions of his readers by the actions that take place with the characters he creates . ",4
"The only disappointment was that the story is not yet finished ",4
"Arrived within a day and a brand new copy . We are totally into the series . And since it is a large book we can now take our time reading . Sent the library book back . ",4
"Great series leaves you wanting more ! ",4
"George Martin has left us hanging and we do n't know when we will see the next book about the game of thrones so badly played by so many people . Great ending to this one and now we must wait for the next one before we know what will happen . I hear he is busy writing it ",4
"I had read a review of this volume that Saud paper was wasted nothing happened especially with Tyrion but this long volume went quickly as I rushed to keep up with each character . Some sad endings but it 's the game of thrones . ",4
"I had a lot of trouble getting into this book . My favorite characters to read about are Dany Sansa Arya and Brienne and Dany was the only one of those featured for the majority of the book . Martin also added many new characters and I was n't able to form attachments to any of them . If you 're going to add new characters to a work that already has so many they need to be interesting right away . Overall this was definitely my least favorite book in the series but I did enjoy it more towards the end . ",2
"I waited a long LONG time for this book to come out . I can say I am not disappointed . Martin is a brilliant story teller . His descriptions and characters and world creation are amazing . However after waiting so very long for this book I was looking forward to and even requiring some resolution . There is n't any and not only is there no resolution but we are introduced to more characters and more plot lines . The story feels like it is too short.The characters are still the best portrayals of real people I 've ever read . There are very few straight up villains you know the kind those that are bad just to because they are bad . Each characters has a history a present and a future their actions and reactions are utterly believable and in character . They grow and change and sometimes diminish . People who are detestable in one book are sympathetic in the next and vise verse . But as in his other books Martin is not nice to his characters in that they do n't all live and they certainly do n't always get what they want or what they deserve . This book is no exception . My mother started reading the first book and when one of her favorite characters was killed flatly refuses to read any more . After many of us have come this far through all the books and all these years be warned not everyone lives to see the end.And as with the previous book this book does not include all the characters . This book and the one before were the same timeline split up amongst the characters . Although I did not feel that each character gave anything to the story meaning they did not all further the plot line . I felt like their chapters were just thrown in just because just because I guess to get all the characters in . Jamie and Brianne get s very small and virtually meaningless showing . Cerasi gets some small play . Arya gets a very small part that has one small addition to the furthering of the plot but added nothing to the greater scheme of things . Minor characters such as Theon Asha and Stannis get big parts but essentially go no where and I really could n't care less about them . Jon and Tyrion and Dany have parts but they are basically meaningless meanderings without resolution or growth . There are new characters introduced or at least they seemed new to me but may have been more minor characters given grander roles at the expense of already developed and loved characters without delivering anything worthwhile in the end . Old characters seem to be in stasis or in a holding pattern waiting for the plot to reach a certain point or not since the plot seems to have frayed . I would have preferred Martin to leave people out if they have no part to play and allow more room to finish some of the more pertinent plot lines and deal with more interesting much loved and existing characters.The plot had a lot of fluff and nonessential often tedious and boring added descriptions weather they be about food history or myths . I do n't recall the others books have whole paragraphs about food or history kingdom relations or myths . There were some pages I flat out skipped which I do n't ever recall doing in the previous 4 books even during rereads . And as another reviewer pointed out there is a lot of sailing these people are sailing then those people are sailing and then these people are sailing AGAIN ! ! And the same goes for marching . And scouting and searching . I really felt like much of this could have been cut and more of the real plot lines put onto the end . There were some sections and some character chapters that left me thinking well what was the point of that ? ? Previous books had forward momentum and development for each character every time . Nothing extraneous was included . In Dance with Dragons some characters have one or two chapters that really have nothing to say or give just a hint of something that never takes shape and then are never seen again . Perhaps in the next book some of it will have meaning but why does it need to be included now ? To take up space and try to fit into my memory banks when it could be included later when its necessary to the plot and makes more sense ? Overall it was an okay read though this book seems to suffer from bloat and fluff and meanders lost . The characters and plot were n't horrible . I enjoyed much of it . Though i kept looking at the completion bar on my Kindle watching it move up and up and waiting for something to happen . In the beginning I kept thinking I 'm only at 15 % or 30 % or 40 % . there 's still time for it to get really good ! But it never happened . When I looked down and saw I saw at 85 % my heart literally sank . At that point I knew there was no saving this book . There was no pulling out of the nose dive.And then it just ended without resolution of any kind without a satisfactory climax without regard for characters plot or us readers . It did not feel like an entire book but more like a prelude . The other books were all massive as well and there are plot line that continue on and on and morph and change but every book just felt like a complete story in itself . Each ending was a crescendo that left me satisfied and wanting more . This one does not . The ending is a slow decline and a fizzle . It seems as if the book just got too long and was just ended with no thought to resolution or timing or plot or us readers . And the cliffhangers well all I have to say is blah . They are n't cliffhangers so much as chopped off lines left dangling . Honestly dangling chopped plots bloated descriptions and fluff filler just seems like lazy writing to me . I felt as if we readers were simply paid lip service . I am not a mindless escapist reader looking for cheap entertainment . Cheap light entertainment is what I was reading while I wait for books like the previous installments of Song of Ice and Fire from authors like Martin and there are n't many like either the series or the author . I was disappointed and a little insulted reading Dance with Dragons.The book was worth reading well I could not have passed it by lets say that and I think there are important happenings to lead into the next book though very few . I am glad I read it but wish it would have been worth the $ 14.99 I paid for the Kindle version and I wish I could have at least some of my weekend back . . .UPDATE I just read a comment made by Martin that Amazon reviews negative ones are from sock puppets and trolls . I bought this book and all the previous books and have read every one often more than once . This review is from a actual reader and honestly a fan for the most part . ",2
"Best one so far ! I ca n't wait until the next one comes out . I hope it is soon . I want to see Cersei get hers ! ! ",4
"of Game of Thrones . This book was not as pleasing as the others . Characters were drawn out and there was little cohesevisness and this author wondered if there was even a plot at this point . To be hones I was disappointed with George Martin . He seemed to struggle to get the words on paper for this one ",3
"I liked how this fifth book was a compilation of a different viewpoint from the characters and a continuation of the story from all points of view after . With all that being said it really did n't serve to move the story along . There seemed to be a great deal of filler information throughout with the overabundance of narrative description of clothing scenery and food.There were still some parts of the book that I had trouble getting through mainly Aisha Greyjoy Quentyn and Davos . Another thing I did not like about this book is that new points of views keep popping up from various characters . It 's like the Greek Mythology Hydra in writing Martin is cutting off one head when a million more sprout up.Martin does an amazing job of dealing with the realities of war and the aftermath it causes . Also the political stratosphere and how one mistake or decision can change the course of everything . ",3
"This installment of GoT was terribly hard to muddle through . The entire book could have been a prologue to an actual meaty important novel.A lot of drawn out story and not much action at all . ",2
"Many surprises too many loose ends . Anxiously awaiting the next installment . Please do n't take too long for the next book . ",3
"As everyone else has already stated the first three books were incredibleseriously they were genius . A Feast for Crows was entertaining if somewhat slow in parts . However A Dance With Dragons seemed to have a stagnate plot . I finished the book thinking that 's it ? It was n't that the entire thing was slow or boring but the problem as others have already mentioned was the introduction of seemingly irrelevant characters that did nothing to advance the story line . Another problem with these new characters is that it made the story hard to follow . They would show up do virtually nothing only to never appear again or only appear briefly . I wish more was focused on the original characters . I thoroughly enjoyed the Arya and Cersi chapters although they were few and far between . Dany 's story line was almost a chore to read in some parts . Anyway long story short and trying not to repeat what others have already stated this was far too long and introduced far too many characters which made it hard to follow . The book should have been about 400500 pages as opposed to 1000 . ",2
"So goodSo much to wait forSo much to find outSo many intertwined storiesplease hurry George and please stay in good health ",4
"SPOILERS AHEADI was prepared for the worst while reading this based on some of the reviews but it is n't as bad as people make it out to be . It 's true that a 'bad ' GRRM book is much better than most out there . Still I ca n't help but feel disappointed that there 's very little plot advancement after yet another 1000 pages and hours of reading . The first thing the reader will notice is that the book begins about halfway through Feast for Crows and those who are dead are not and events that have happened are still to come . It can be a little disorienting at first and a bit of a waste of time.There are three main issues I have with the book.. the first is the shock of main characters dying has worn off because well they do n't stay dead . So anyone who dies might still come back and haunt the rest of the book . Character deaths therefore lose their punch I keep waiting to hear about Robb leading another host . The second issue is the rush of new characters . Aegon really ? The Prince of Dorne ? Are they necessary ? Why do we care ? And therein lies my biggest critique we 've emotionally invested in the characters only to see to them killed off marginalized andor supplanted by new ones . Tyrion is probably the most glaring example of this . He still seems to have the smarts that made him a central force through the first couple books but here he 's a shell of himself a caricature of himself and half of his travels are wholly unnecessary if they did away with the Dorne subplot . And Jon..I 'll finish the series if GRRM sees fit to finish it . And I recommend the book but did n't feel the need to power through with sleepless nights . Not that there 's any rush anyway.. there 's no timetable on the next one so pick your way through the world and settle in for a long ride . ",2
"The series continues and does not disappoint . Still largely unpredictable heartbreaking and exciting as well . Waiting for the next book will be painful . ",4
"Resentments are brought on oneself most often . I bought this book after going through A Feast of Crows and rereading A Clash and A Storm suffering through the interminable waiting . I like many of you was happily excited on learning that A Dance had hit the bookseller 's shelves . But then now about half way through the book the expectations have turned to resentments . And some of this resentment can be fairly laid at the foot of Mr. Martin.If I met the author on the street my question to him would be Why are all your characters in A Dance With Dragons stuck in aspic ? Why are they all seemingly incapable of getting anything done ? They go here they go there and back to there and here again like music CD 's permanently set on repeat.Maybe it is just moi but I do n't think so as other reviewers have touched on the same frustrating development . Is it because a decision has been made to extend A Story of Ice and Fire to at least seven volumes readers be damned thus the necessity of stringing things out and out and out.For some unfathomable reason I guess my expectations concerning A Dance With Dragons were way off . I had thought we would start to see some resolution for at least some of the characters . Instead we get more Saturday afternoon matin & eacutee.Alas ! ",2
"I can not even start a new book at this point because I am completely in love with George R.R . Martin 's world . I will not give away any of the plot . This is the fifth book in an incredible series that is a MUST READ for fans of fantasy or historical fiction . Very graphic sex and violence . Be prepared to be immersed . ",4
"I never thought I 'd be writing this review . I once considered myself a fervent fan of the A Song of Ice and Fire series . I started reading the series about a decade ago when it consisted of three novels . Since then GRRM has managed to add a grand total of two books . The plot 's forward momentum has ground to a halt as beloved welldeveloped characters are unceremoniously killed off and replaced with vapid onedimensional pawns who are coldly maneuvered on the evershifting chessboard of Westeros and now the Free Cities.It 's not hard to say what went wrong . Martin quite simply pulled a Jordan . Too many characters too many subplots too little editing and focus on core conflicts . There 's nothing offensive in comparing him to Robert Jordan those who award 3 stars or less to this book are fans or former fans who wanted to see the series end as strongly as it began . We do n't say this out of spite we say it out of disappointment with something we once loved . We would not have read five books deepincluding the mediocre A FEAST FOR CROWSif Martin had n't earned our devotion and good will by doing something right in those first three books.In two months I 've read a quarter of ADWD and even that much required a massive effort of will . The plot is going nowhere . I am tired of reading about Davos Daario Griff and Young Griff and all the other meaningless minor characters and subplots while Tyrion Jon and Dany spin their wheels . I 'm tired of the oncefresh device of killing off sympathetic main characters turning into a gimmick . I 'm tired of prose that reads like a dry travelogue of Old Valyria listing the flora and fauna of the region including types of river turtles the precise width of bodies of water and their tributaries and other similarly riveting subjects . At this point I 'm just waiting for Martin to start describing the embroidery on a shawl or the cream color slashing a blue silk dress.I 'm tired of hearing the tale grew in the telling . It 's an excuse . The tale did n't grow the editing shrank.Martin is clearly floundering unsure of how to proceed . As I read about Tyrion wallowing in selfpity Dany losing her wits and Jon bumbling around aimlessly I ca n't help but see them as metaphors for their creator.Books 4 and 5 of ASoIaF should not have been written . Martin should 've embraced the boldness that made him famous for beheading dear old Ned and made the jump to five years in the future . Skip the setup cut straight to the good stuff . I hope Books 6 7 and possibly probably additional titles will return to the glory of the original three but I 'm honestly not sure I 'll be there to read them . The good will Martin built up with the first three books in the series has been systematically squandered with a decade 's worth of waiting for the monumental disappointments that were AFFC and ADWD.Meanwhile back to slogging through encyclopedia entries about Meereenese political customs and shipbuilding practices from the Narrow Sea region ",1
"This book series began strongly and I was definitely hooked . I burned through the first three in probably less than 2 weeks . I love the genre and the characters really grew on me . I wanted to know where they and the realm would end up.What I began noticing however was that George Martin 's writing tends towards being a whole lot of words about nothing . No furtherance of major plot points . No grand character arcs as those who you hold onto tightest end up being killed off for nothing . It gets to a point where you do n't care about any of them anymore because who knows awhat the overall PLOT of the book is and bwho will even be around 5 chapters later.Gag me if I have to read 20 zillion more pages about extraneous scene descriptions . I ended up skipping pages at a time because they consisted entirely of descriptive fluff . What else made my eyes roll ? All the turning his head and spats and bit hisher tongue so hard heshe tasted bloods . Talk about repetitive literary tricks . It 's the complete opposite of the word 'creative ' . Martin 's writing is cliche and tired.I feel as though I wasted my time and money with A Dance With Dragons . Absolutely nothing gets resolved as it was in A Feast for Crows only more questions are raised . I was a fan but now I 'm definitely a hater . Heed my review and save your money . That dayweekwhatever of your life you spend reading this garbage you will never be able to get back . ",0
"At long last we have DWD in our hands ready to be read . Fortunately the book was worth the wait.Some initial criticisms of the book have centered around the lack of resolutions given and the fact that most of the book is setup . Well guess whatits a 7 book series . The book is not going to resolve anything . Martin has never written his books in an episodic fashion and he has used cliffhangers before so I do n't know where the hate is coming from.There are significant things that happen in this book though I wo n't give away what . One is a big revealplot twist that I honestly never saw happening and it will definitely change things in Westeros.For specifics the book focuses primarily on Jon Snow Daenerys and Tyrion . The weakest chapters are the ones focusing on Daenerys as her character is mired with all the difficult choices that she faces . Her chapters are n't a pleasure to read but I believe that 's because Martin designed them that waywe 're supposed to be frustrated by how Dany is handling things just as we were supposed to be upset by Ned Stark 's death in book 1 . Most of the book is preparationthings are moving into place setting the scene for the grand finale . In this sense it is definitely a middle book.Martin 's writing in general is very strong other than his must needs quirk and the annoying 'It is known ' 'It is known ' saying . It really is just a pleasure to read to see how he deals with characters dialogueand setting . In fact I 'm willing to say that within fantasy there is n't an author our there currently that can match him in that regard.In short my clumsy haphazard review is this go buy it and enjoy it . ",4
"Imagine that if Tolkien had written The Fellowship from different perspectives and we had a chapter told by Gimli the Dwarf . That is what Martin does in A Dance with Dragons and the entire A Song of Ice and Fire . Even the villains get a chance to tell how they arrive at horrendous outcomes . This is another masterpiece . ",4
"I loved A Dance with Dragons . Yes cliffhangers are frustrating when you know you may be waiting five years to have them resolved . Yes 15 % of the book is listing what'sfordinner . Just remember that we would n't be so impatient if we did n't love these books these characters and this world . When the series is over we 'll have it . The cliffhanger criticism will be moot . I have faith that it will be great . If you ca n't handle being challenged then I 'm sure Charlaine Harris or Stephanie Meyer will be happy to take your bookbuying dollar . ",4
"Scary excellent reading well written could not put it down towards the end when is the next ? ? ? Hurry up ca n't wait . ",4
"Similar to the other books in the series.a good read but can be slow at times . GRRM goes into detail on the meals served so do n't read on an empty stomach . ",3
"I love the previous books and I felt that this was a bit of a let down . Despite having all my favorite characters in this book I found most of their stories very boring and stagnate with the exception to Arya 's story . The ending was pretty surprising though and I hope that the next book resolves some things and is a bit more exciting . ",2
"Not as gripping as the earlier volumes in the series this installment at least restores many familiar protagonists after the disconcerting book four where we were confronted by many new faces and plot twists . There are plenty of surprises plenty of shocks and of course anyone who has followed the saga to this point is naturally going to read on . The languageexpression changes again is a little inconsistent but perhaps that is inevitable with books written years apart.There is also a considerable sense of padding and fillingin but never mind the tale is good and is moving forward and the best heroes are still around or at least so we hope ! ",3
"A great series has become merely tedious . It 's long past time for these story lines to be brought to a close . This book is boring dreadfully slow and not worth the effort . GRRM can take as long as he likes for the next installment or better yet never finish it . The first three books were brilliant but these last two are a poor finish to what he started.Hopefully HBO will bring in some fresher younger blood to wrap up the series lest all the actors die of old age meandering their way through this ponderous mess . ",1
"This book is great and when it rapidly picks up pace of events closer to the end the actual end of the book feels like stopping at the cliff . You desperately want to know what happens the very next day with multiple story lines converging around one city but you could not.I want to buy book 6.Except there is not book 6 yet . ",4
"I loved the first three books in this series . But after a feast for crows I was about ready to give up . Now having read a dance with dragons I do give up . This series could 've been wrapped up a few thousand pages and several thousand trees ago . We are now hopping and skipping from character to character without any real advancement of plot . I no longer care what happens to any of these people . There are a few characters I might have still cared about if anything interesting had ever happened in this book.In other words if the next book ever comes out I 'm keeping my money and saving my time . ",1
"Soooo disappointed there is no book 6 or 7 ! Sounds like another Auel in the making waiting years for the next book.Still I will buy the third season video . ",4
"I remain appreciative of Martin 's skill but I 've become exhausted with this series . I kept going with A Dance with Dragons even though I found myself skipping large descriptive portions that I found indulgent and pointless because I really hoped there was finally going to be some significant plot progress by the end . But there 's not . 1000 pages and Daenerys is still not even bound for Westeros ? New potential kings are still cropping up ? We still do n't know what 's become of several Starks the family we started this whole series with and whom have been steadily tortured and destroyed in every way possible with nary a sign of relief in sight ? It is just feeling so indulgent on Martin 's part at this point . I am losing faith that there will be a payoff . I ca n't imagine what ending could possibly feel satisfying . There 's a chance he could still pull it off but I think he 's just built anticipation too much and tortured us as readers too much.And yes he is still good at what he was always good at creating a fully fleshedout world that at this point we know like it 's our own and portraying the points of view of a dizzying array of characters . I do n't think anything like it has ever been attempted and I appreciate that . But enough already ! Give us some beef ",2
"I liked that book yet I found it quite long all the conspiracies take too much place in the novel to my taste . ",3
"Love this book so far . Makes up for the fourth book a great for crows . Characters are great and I 'm loving how different characters are entwined with each other ",4
"Words are wind George and you seem to like yours more than most . A ramble worthy of any mad Targaryen . Just finish the books George . ",0
"I love where this seems to be heading but DANG ! Now I sit waiting with everyone else For the next one ! ",4
"In the end I just got tired of reading elaborate descriptions of disgusting food and torture . I waded through an awful lot of pigeon testicle pies and nipple amputations and it just got too much . I read all the books through half of this one and I just love Tyrion and Arya and even Sansa . Littlefinger is endlessly compelling . The characters are just so indelible and if you can keep up with the plot you 're a better person than I am . Great stuff but be prepared . ",3
"I would suggest skipping this book and just reading the cliff notes in preparation for the next . Martin seems to need to tread water for a few hundred pages . The books are beginning to read more like a history than a story . Though I understand that Martin wishes to stress the uniqueness of the surprise and the minutia of everyday life the two combine in this book to make reading a completely unrewarding experience . It is either painstakingly describing a meal or sitting bored in a throne room or killing off characters by the handful . It lacks the subtle balance of building and relieving tension . It 's just left to simmer.After awhile I stopped caring so much about the characters and the book became easier to read . I felt unrewarded for my investments in characters or plot twists.There were also some odd mistakes . For instance children only hungry for a few days were described with distended stomachs while this actually occurs after malnutrition covering months or years . Also in one paragraph a character is described with her hair up and the next it is falling around her shoulders . I stopped keeping track after a dozen.I ca n't help but suspect this was a rush job and needed more tender loving care from an editor . ",1
"If you like the series this sequel will not disappoint . It 's been some time since I read it but I believe he 's not finished yet . ",4
"Marvelous book ! The story of Westerios and the Free Cities and all its wonderful characters continued in the fifth book of this amazing series.I read all 5 books in a row and I 'm really sad I ca n't pick up the next book and keep on reading till the story ends.I really hope George RR Martin wo n't take 5 years to finish the next book cause I wan na know what happens next as soon as possible ! ",4
"As always a pleasure to readthis last book leaves me wanting the next . The books ends with many issues impacting all of the characters in need of being resolved ..I 'm very curious about Daenerys and Tyrion and Jon Snow and Arya . and the dragons ! . I am also curious about Theon an Asha.. and curious about the Others .Someone mentioned that they felt sorry for Cersi in this book I have a feeling that the events that happened to her in this book will only spur her onto more evil and cruel endeavors in the futureI ca n't wait for the next book ",4
"A gripping read with stories within stories that add to the richness of the tapestry Martin is creating.A must read for all fans of the series.Now to wait for book 6 ",4
"Daenerys Tyrion Arya and Jon are my favorite characters . Please do n't kill them off ! POV from too many characters including many that I do not care about but of course I still read it . This is a wonderful series and I suggest you start with book 1 . Scifi history kings and queens murder incest loyalty and dragons all in one book . ",4
"The kindle version is great . No problem in that matter and the book is awesome . You ca n't just get enough . At the end you want to read the next . This collection is terrific . 100 % reccomendable in all senses ",4
"I love the whole story of song of ice and fire . The author is brilliant and his detailed descriptions of all the characters and places keeps you glued to the pages . In this book there are major events happening with Jon the wall and the wildings Danny in Meereen and the dragons and Stannis on his march and in Winterfell . Also one of our favorites tyrion and his misadventures and usual comic and amusing self . Not to mention new intriguing characters and twists but no spoilers will I reveal here . It is a long book and there are some awesome cliffhangers so the story is not finished yet . Some people may find this annoying but I find it very exciting and eagerly waiting for the next book . In the meantime I am reading winter is coming which explains a lot of the mysteries and prophecies in the series in additions to tying it into history . What can I say I am just a real fan of Martin and his fantasy writing although I consider myself a die hard history buff . It is amazing how I can enjoy something so different from history but at the same time feels so real . It 's all because of Martin and his story telling . So read on and enjoy ! ! ",4
"It 's hard to stop reading this book . Ca n't wait for the next one to tie things together . But oh so much death ",4
"A long wait has a way of raising expectations to levels that often can not be met.This however is not the case with A Dance with Dragons . It delivers the characters it promised to deliver and more I loved every one of the new POVs as well as the chapters reconnecting with characters from A Feast for Crows and it delivers the rich atmosphere shocking plot twists and fascinating background details that make A Song of Ice and Fire a standout series . Martin is a master storyteller who is n't bound by genre or by conventions some chapters are high fantasy others are almost pure horror and it all blends so very well.Admittedly I was not one of those who was disappointed in the previous book A Feast for Crows . In fact I rank it my second favourite after A Game of Thrones but alongside A Storm of Swords . Where would I place A Dance with Dragons ? Narrowly below AFfC and ASoS and a fair bit ahead of A Clash of Kings . In terms of stars I would place all but ACoK at 5 with it somewhere around 4 or 4 12 if that existed.Those who did n't care for A Feast for Crows may find the first half of ADwD to be somewhat similar in tone and pacing and they may also find themselves less enamoured than I was with the new POVs . However the buildup of the first half comes to several very strong I hesitate to use the word satisfying because the emotions elicited by what happens are n't quite right for that conclusions in the latter half . ",4
"I have loved all of the books in the series . I have been watching the series on HBO and tried hard to pace myself along with it . I COULD NOT STOP MYSELF ",4
"It 's a great book and I ca n't wait for the next one to come out . You learn so much more about the story line characters and plots when you read one of Martin 's books . It was so funny when the last season ended and everyone who had n't read the books was horrified when some of the main characters were killed off . Everyone who had read the books knew it was coming ! READ the books they are great . ",4
"I loved the first 3 books in this series . Four and five are moreorless one book and I can see why it is split this way but I was starting to get a little confused and having trouble remembering where all the different characters and plot lines were at any given point in Dragons . I sort of felt as if the whole structure is beginning to wobble under its own weight . Nonetheless if and when # 6 comes out I will be in line with my credit card ! ",3
"Great continuation of George R.R . Martin 's Game of Thrones saga . The only disappointment was that I thought it was the last book of the series and it ends with tons of plots that need to be finished . This would be good news if the sequels were already written and published ! If the next book is not released soon I will have to reread all of the previous 5 books to make sure I have all the characters and their movements down pat . ",4
"This was great but the saga is not finished he needs to write more books . The dragons are still across the sea this needs to be finished there could be a lot more books.There is more of the story that should be revealed regarding a lot ofthe characters some of their fates are still left hanging . ",4
"The first for books were amazing.This one started off great . But unlessthere is to be a sixth in the series you'llbe left hanging.No mention of what happened to the main familycharacters except for those passed on.No mention of how or if their home was reclaimed.No mention if they lived happily ever after or not.Left hanging . I want to know the end . ",2
"Warning Some Spoilers ! ! ! I finally finished the book . I can breathe a sigh of well earned relief . I no longer have to worry about getting near the internet and accidentally reading a spoiler . All in all as usual I am left unsatisfied by the book . Not because it lacks quality or because it lacks anything really . It is just that I wish more could have happened.I would happily trade that useless page describing the Shield Hall for one more of Dany learning to ride her dragon . I would be ever so glad to to have spent a little more time with Theon as he and Jeyne escaped Winterfell rather than the massive pile of back story pages . I would desperately like to understand Where in the Sam Hell the Arya Stark story is going . That poor girl has been on a journey that deserves a restfor crying out loud.Some of the reviewers are unhappy with the dead not staying dead . I agree with this . I would especially have liked to see Catelyn Stark stay dead . I understand that Martin wo n't ever be kind enough to let all my fovorite characters live . I accept that but the bringing back the dead ploy is getting a little thin . I never understood nor agreed with Martin that this should have been allowed . I am a little tired as well of some of the time wasting side stories . The prince that was not a Dragonlord but thought he was as an example . We could do with a lot more action from the main characters and he coulda just sunk that guy in the sea for all his story did to advance the plot.Regardless of all those legitimate complaints all is forgiven . This man writes better in a fog of haze and dragonblood than most authors could ever dream of doing . We should all recognize that Mr. George RR Martin is a modern day writer of genius and classic quality . The likes of which we are very lucky to have available to our generation and for generations to come.Now to just wait 6 years for another book.. SIGH ",4
"I was not expecting another in the series so I grabbed this one when I saw it . It 's been a long time since I finished the first four but I did not need to review to get caught up . Thanks Mr. Martin for keeping this world alive . ",4
"I think I 've been waiting for years for this one to come out on paperback ! I wanted the paperbackversion so I could add it to my paperbackcollection of the first 4 books ! grinThis was n't my favorite of the 5 books because I 'm a little bored with Daenerys ' slow progressing storyline but it was still a pageturner . ",3
"Given the expectations created by A Storm of Swords and AFFC this book does n't deliver . I could write a longer review but I do n't want to pull a Martin and take 10 years writing it . ",0
"I want to start by saying that whenever I finish a book that I have questions about I look to Amazon reviews for insight and perspective . And I find it even when I disagree . I glanced at the star rating for ADWD the day my copy of the book arrived a mere day or so after the book was available there were 300 reviews and the average star rating was 3 . When I finished the book and returned to Amazon to get insight and perspective there were over 750 reviews . It was telling that the reviews considered most helpful by readers were the 2 and 3 star ones written by people who loved the series and were disappointed in ADWD . I agree with some comments about slow plot development nonresolution of storylines endless irrelevant details repetitions and cruelties lack of critical editing and the great Theon story arc . I disagree with other comments some of which I will address in the body of this piece but my main focus is discussing ADWD and ASOFAI from another perspective.There will be SPOILERSbe so advised.AGOT begins at Winterfell with the Stark family awaiting Ned 's good friend and king Robert Baratheon . We quickly learn Starks are our heroes King Robert is good but flawed Lannisters are bad . Fiercely loyal and honorable Ned bringing his daughters with him follows King Robert to Court . At the same time Ned sends his mysteriously origined bastard son off to exile at the ever cold Wall where men serve until death taking no wives fathering no children and getting their head cut off if they decide that that hard thankless life is n't for them . We gather he does this because his wife does n't like being reminded of her husband 's infidelity.Throughout AGOT we accept that Robert Baratheon belongs on the Iron Throne because Mad King Aeyrs Targaryen was unfit to rule . The one person who might have a better claim to the Iron Throne Prince Viserys is horrible . Possibly less horrible than Prince Joffrey but we never find out . About the time Ned gets his head cutoff Daenerys Stormborn brings magic back into the world.I think that the themes progression and journey of the whole series are set out in the second book ACOK in two Daenerys POV chapters 1 when Quaithe gives her advice and 2 when Daenerys visits the House of the Undying Ones . I often return to the latter POV to get a sense of where the story is going . This is the great reversal of the series as it continues we learn that we were misled into believing that King Robert belonged on the throne that he was good and the Stark family noble . Robert Baratheon was a Usurper and his pal Ned Stark a traitor . The Iron Throne belongs to House Targaryen . A digression here Ned 's death was shocking but not unreasonable when a character is maimedNed 's leg was surely gangrenousand his story arc has no place to go he is often killed off.The epic here with room for lots of battles magic and characters is The Saga of How House Targaryen Got the Iron Throne Back Ensured Succession and Saved the Realms of Man for Another Thousand Years . That 's the story I thought I was getting even through AFFC but then GRRM spent the nearly 1000 page ADWD on minutia with only the occasional pause for brilliance . It is wonderful to spend time with favorite characters . Yet when the real story has n't even begun it seems wasteful to spend so many pages on turning Cersei into Lucretia Borgia on everybody travelling endlessly on stormtossed seas to some destination they never reach on characters that start out interesting and then peter away or just disappear . Remember Robert 's bastards ? Why did we even care about Edric Storm Gendry Mya if the legitimacy of Cersei 's children will become a moot point ? Why was the promising Brienne turned into Don Quijote totally incompetent and incapable of accomplishing any missionand why in the name of the Seven did GRRM maim her ? That is the problem with GRRM adding character upon character . For R'hllor 's sake finish off some minor storylines before beginning others.The wonder of the series for me is the world GRRM has created . Not just the cities and people that exist now but the mythology . The way this family and that trace their ancestry back to the Andals or the First Men . Passing through the sea around Valyria still boiling and deadly centuries after the Doom an Atlantisesque volcanic eruption ? gave me goosebumps . Tyrion 's journey down the river is wonderful because Tyrion appreciated the ruins of civilizations that once were and no longer are a marvelous lesson for any wouldbe royal adviser . But when Tyrion fell off the boat saving Prince Aegon he should have drowned . Here was a character so full of selfloathing who committed crimes so heinous that his story arc was irredeemable his redemption and end should have come during that amazing scene through the Palace of Sorrow as sad as it would have been to lose him . Instead GRRM brought him back gave him a personality transplant and Tyrion was reborn as an oaf better suited to the grotesquerie outside the walls of Meereen than as a royal adviser . Some characters should just stay dead.I like how the petty concerns of menwho sits on the Iron Thronecontrasts with the real problemthe destruction of the realms of manthat waits at the Wall . The Wall that we learn in ADWD was once manned by Knights and is now the domain of bastards criminals and those Dickensian children people are always trying to get rid of in novels has its own mythology spanning millennia . When the Westerosi utter the curse May the Others take him a phrase I love hearing over and over it 's because there have been no Others for 1000 years . A thousand years ! Only Jon Snow sees the implication of the wilding flight south if they are afraid of the Others the entire realm is in danger which is why his character is essential to the story . A digression Melisandre has turned into the Aunt Clara of the priests of R'hllor she sees things in the fire but darn if she does n't misinterpret them . So if she thinks the children of the forest are bad they are probably good . Heck she asks to see AA gets Jon and is annoyed by the vision . Another digression I like that Jon 's raven repeats itself . Ravens do that . And it is a way to get information to Jon and us through Bran ? .I think the character of Prince Aegon is an important addition . In the scene in the House of the Undying Ones in ACOK Dany sees Rhaegar who we 'll come to understand was a pretty decent guy saying to a woman nursing a baby named Aegon He has a song . He is the prince that was promised and his is the song of ice and fire . Many of us thought the woman was Lyanna and the baby Jon but Lyanna died in childbirth after Rhaegar 's death so it could never have been Jon . The story needs Prince Aegon . Not only because the dragon has three heads but because if Mirri Maz Duur 's curse is true Dany will never have a living child and the story is incomplete without a succession plan for House Targaryen . Up to this point I had expected that the curse would be circumvented Macduff style where the baby is born dead but comes to life after his stillbirth . Having a second Targaryen remember even if Jon is the third head he is still sworn to the NW and ca n't become king or father legitimate children as a compliment to Dany is a good thing.A word about the Stark children they are our guides through the world of the series . They are the smallfolk whose rights get trampled when lords play the game of thrones a phrase I hope never to see again . Maester Aemon gave Jon some advice kill the boy and let the man be born . No one ever gave Robb that advice and he ended up dead as a result of his own irresponsible actions marriage contracts should not be broken no matter how cute the girl . I hope the remaining Stark children make it to the end of the series but they have become witnesses and not actors with the possible exception of Jon Snow who might not turn out to be a Stark child after all.Some readers have commented that GRRM lost control of his story ran out of drive or energy or wanted to run up the book count . I thought that he just liked the world of the series and wanted to stay there for a while . I understand I have favorite characters that I like spending time with Arya Tyrion before his resurrection Jon and Dany but stories must have an end . If it is no less than five years between books and GRRM plans at least three more I worry one of us wo n't live long enough to get to the end . GRRM has an advantage over me he actually has an idea how the story turns out . After reading Amazon reviews I am worried that GRRM really has lost his way . Otherwise why would he have Jon Tyrion and Varys do such stupid and uncharacteristic things for such stupid reasons ? I cut Dany some slack because she is very young and this is the first time in her life that she feels safe.I will wait for TWOW and hope that HBO pushes GRRM to bring it out in a respectable time frame . I will hope that the Old Gods grant GRRM a tough editor who sets him on the correct path and that he stops maiming humiliating torturing and killing his good characters . GRRM had his irresponsible wouldbe kings and their armies burn the fields of Westeros with Winter Coming . People are already eating their deadand it 's only fallso I guess my petition that he stop serving dogs rats and the dead as entrees will go unfulfilled . One reviewer thought that Tyrion is GRRM 's alter egomight I suggest Ramsey Snow ? I hope that the author of ADWD is reborn as the author of AGOTACOKASOS and that TWOW delights . ",2
"All these books are great if a bit frustrating jumping from one character to another . That said I can not wait for the next book I 've been through the available books in the series and am making do with the TV show . ",4
"INTRODUCTION As I mentioned in other posts there are only two authors that I regard as iconic in fantasy and one of them is George Martin since before A Game of Thrones appeared and especially before it started taking off in the late 90 's early 00 's I found very little genre fantasy to read . I am not a Tolkien Feist D & D Jordan Erikson etc fan since I prefer my fantasy to be with little magic and closer to historical fiction my main problem with magic is that it suffers from the works at one clock but not at two a clock syndrome as well as the authors rarely exploring the implications on societal evolution of having unambiguous I can kick it proof of mind 's ability to influence matter directly not through technology and science.Before AGoT I knew about Mr. Martin from his awesome Sandkings novella which was one of the defining texts of my childhood that made me a lifelong sf fan so intrigued by the blurb I bought AGoT on release and never looked back while thinking that yes this is the fantasy I want to read . On the other hand I do not tend to agonize over unfinished series and I read the books as they come so after A Feast for Crows and the rereads of the earlier three books in 2005 I kind of forgot about ASoIaF until this year 's superb TV series put me back in a Westeros mood and I 've reread the four earlier books.So very very high expectations for A Dance with Dragons and after the first two reads I have to say that the book while not perfect and quite transitional and expanding the storylines rather than starting to pull them together as one would expect in a fifth out of seventh series novel delivered more than enough to be my top fantasy of the year so far.In the following I will try to avoid major spoilers for the novel itself though there will be of course major ones for the series up to AFFC and as befitting a novel of such huge scope with action taking place in many locales lots of characters etc the review will be more of a collection of impressions and highlights as well as some of the stuff I thought worked less well . As usual whatever counts as spoiler for a person may not count as such for me so if you have not read A Dance with Dragons so far read what follows at your peril ! OVERVIEWANALYSIS The first thing that surprised me when reading A Dance with Dragons is that the book does not have the each word counts finished feel I expected after the very public six year struggle of the author with it for the first 600 pages I felt like almost nothing happens as the big picture goes just going back and forth to mark the time until the timeline gets to the end of A Feast for Crows and things can start happening when things start to happen yes the action is mostly awesome but there is some silliness too.Now almost nothing happens would be an indictment for many authors since it would mean bloated verbosity but in GRRM 's case the world building the character dialogue and the nuggets of action that we see are more than enough to make the pages turn by themselves and keep one absorbed.Yes not all storylines are equally absorbing and for me the North alternates between very interesting when we see the actions of various Northern lords most notably the Boltons and lord Manderly in the new circumstances while Stannis prepares to assert his rule and confront his enemies and the more boring parts of Jon trying to be humane and integrate the starving fleeing wildlings with their historical enemies the Night Watch whose commander he happens to be . Never a big favorite of mine I have to say that Lord Snow 's arc is one of the best realized in the book and it will be a highlight for many.Or Tyrion 's wanderings where maybe because of him being still in shock after the dramatic events of A Storm of Swords he is far from the sharp operator we got to know and love and seems more like a comic relief persona thrown there to be blown away on the wind by whatever current is stronger at the moment . This was the part I was looking forward the most and maybe because of that it was the most disappointing thread of the novel.The other main story of the novel Daenerys ' rule of Meereen is quite interesting though even if it is not what what is generally assumed that happens in fantasy where the destined one comes conquers snaps hisher fingers and all live happily ever after . No here we see reality conquering with a strong army and better weapons is easy but holding on what you conquer is very hard and requires sacrifices this point of is it worth to conquer hoping to give people a better life only to realize that most want the lives they led before and having peace may mean compromising all you hold dear ? that we see repeated throughout history up to the present is one that GRRM keeps making and as mentioned above there is no out of jail card . I found this thread excellent and very realistic though I am sure that people wanting traditional fantasy will hate it the most.Daenerys ' peregrination and decisions were simple so far she acted true to her principles and despite hardships she has won but now that she decided to actually rule she faces two equally unheroic choices bath Meereen in the blood of her enemies including the hostages from her entourage that she came to like or compromise with the slavers and their allies and allow a more relaxed form of what came before . And the way this dilemma plays through the book was to me one of the highlights of the novel without easy choices the author 's handling of it was as good as possible within the constraints.Interspersed with these three main stories there are a lot of other characters stories and those mostly work well but here and there I was wondering at the structure of the novel and how quite a few of those Bran and Cersei 's chapters for example and maybe even Arya 's could have easily been included in A Feast for Crows since they are tangential to this book while leaving space for expanding the intrinsic stories of A Dance with Dragons and sparing us the unfinished feel we get in the end feel which the author clearly indicated was due for lack of space.A Dance with Dragons is not short on great lines and there are quite a few scenes that hold with the best to date in the series but I will leave that for everyone to discover them . For myself besides the obvious ones Cersei 's arc was quite memorable for example especially still having clear in mind Lena Hadley 's arrogant but great performance of the queen in the TV seriesAs for characters for me the best one in the heroic fantasy mode was Ser Barristan who has several POV chapters and he is given ample scope to show why he is so famous after all . The most disappointing one was Tyrion as mentioned above.Now for the things that worked less well I think that Mr. Martin 's decision to split the story geographically rather than chronologically was misguided and A Dance with Dragons shows it since until the timeline catches with AFFC nothing major we do not know about can happen and this what I call the prequel 's bane makes those first 600 pages or so much slower than the rousing finale.The wrap up to most stories is another issue here the culprit is the page count which basically forced the author to postpone lots of events to the next book so there is a feel of incompleteness and while it bothers me less than others I think that will be easily seen as the major shortcoming of the novel . The good news is that once The Winds of Winter will be out this aspect will be forgotten the bad news is that we have no idea when that book will be outAnd here we come to the last thing of concern namely that at the current pace I have a hard time seeing it finished in two more volumes even of 1000 pages like this one . Now that is not a bad thing since I am happy to read at length about the wonderful characters of GRRM and their world but one thing I hope is that the author will not try again to be over ambitious and stick with a I said seven seven must be plan and then realize he simply does not have the space to tell all the stories he wants the way he wants . When in a fifth out presumably seventh book and in 1000 pages+ the story and characters expand sometimes quite a lot rather than starting to get together this is something one has to mention.Overall I think that if you are an obsessive fan who discusses the finest points of the series in great detail in various forums the book will be acceptable but not totally awesome for the reasons mentioned above but if you love a grand scale epic series where the author keeps his action have consequences and there is no get out the jail card stance that so shocked people including myself in the earlier volumes A Dance with Dragons A++ will be the one novel you want to read this year indeed !

"i want more val morghoris and history of the undead . i just ca n't wait for the sequel thank you for a great series grrm ",4
"I found the book to be drawn out . Did not enjoy reading it as much as the first book . The book looses its intrigue . Will not be buying the other two books that follow on Dance of Dragons . Will rather watch the TV series Game of Thrones . ",1
"Everything one would come to expect from this Gran Maester of Fantasy fiction . While we had to wait a torturous five years after A Fast for Crows ' the wait for ' A Dance with Dragons was worth it . Martin picks up right where he left off . Dany and her nearly full grown dragons have survived an epic battle as she makes her way to Westeros across the Narrow Sea from Essos to claim the Iron Throne hat she states is rightfully hers as the Targaryens were proper rulers of Westeros and the five kingdoms . Double and triple crosses abound as people change their faiths to the different houses and of course some deaths though not a shocking as depicted in the Red Wedding back in ' A Storm of Swords ' . And there is one character Reek some readers maybe familiar with Cersei has learned about the death of her father Lord Tywin and suspects her brother Tyrion the Imp though he 's imprisoned and she 'll do anything with her twin brother Jaime 's help to crush anyone that gets in her way . The book ends with a taste of what is to come with the net installment 'The Winds of Winter ' and not even Georg 's publishers know hen he will turn it in . Hopefully we wont ' have to wait another five years hurry up George Winter is Coming and the TV series is catching up as we wait for the concluding volume ' A Dream of Spring ' . ",4
"So I finally got through this book ! I 've been reading it forever ! And by that I do n't mean to say that I did n't like it or that it was hard to get through because it was n't . Or at least not any harder than any other of Martin 's books . It 's just a situation where I was n't in a hurry because this was book 5 and book 6 is n't expected out for a long time 2015 according to Goodreads.com . So I would read a few chapters then not pick it up for a few weeks . I read several other books finishing them first while ADWD was on the back burner . It came and went but I decided that I finally needed to finish it.As for the book I wo n't talk much about the plot because as I said before this is book 5 and I do n't want to do too many spoilers for earlier books . If I do any I 'll warn you first.I 've said it before and I 'll say it again I LOVE this story ! The characters and settings and conflicts are masterfully done and once you get into the story you just ca n't put it down . That said Martin 's writing style can be a big difficult to get into . You have to get used to the way he writes . His style is n't bad or amateur . It 's just kind of heavy . Then again if you make it all the way to book 5 I suppose you would 've made your peace with the writing hundreds of pages ago.While book 4 focused a lot on the less mainstream story lines Book 5 goes back to the more central conflicts and characters we 've come to love . Many people have criticized this book for its meandering andI can kind of see their point . I do wish Martin would move the story along a bit more quickly rather than going into detail about characters cities and cultures that have nothing to do with the main characters . Yet being a writer by the time I got to the end I could see how he was shaping the story and where he was going all along . He just could have gotten there sooner.I 've also heard criticism about the title because this sounds like it will feature a lot of dragon action but according to others they barely spread their wings . I do n't agree with this criticism . Though it 's true that the dragons are n't the central element in the plot I do think they were what this installment was always working up to . Near the end Barriston Selmy gives the title it 's meaning . He says Not all men are meant to dance with dragons . Notice that the dance of the title is singular not plural . minor spoiler The character that does the dance dies in the process . I promise this is not a major spoiler because it was not a major character but still when you think of it that way the Dance with Dragons in this book ended in death . So the point of the title is that the story points toward the cliff hanger end which is full of death and ruin.One could argue that there are other dragon dances of course literal in the case of Daenarys and the death pits and figurative for Jon Snow . All threads end in disaster fitting for a novel which is n't the final one and while the novel stalled a bit in the middle the end left me desperately wanting book 6.There was also a very touching chapter near the end with Daenarys looking back over her recent choices and conversing with an imagined someone that she regrets having sent away . I found it very touching as it strayed into literary fiction and had a sweet melancholy feel . Possibly my favorite part of this book.Overall if you 're into Martin 's series this is simply a continuation of the story . It may not be the most exciting installment nothing has equaled Book 3 yet but it 's important to read this to get to the next part . Martin has set up some exciting things for book 6 andlike all the other epic fantasy suckersI will be preordering it when it becomes available . ",3
"I loved the first three books . I was hoping the 4th was a fluke but after finally getting through a Dance with Dragons I am bored . I actually could n't read more than one chapter without falling asleep . I feel like half of this book could have been cut out and still gotten to the same ending point . I would love to know how the story ends but I do n't think I can get through another book like this without knowing when the end is . ",1
"Loved it ! Waiting for the next book in this series ! Come on Mr Martin ! Get writing ! Please ! 5 Stars ! Must Read Series ! ",4
"First I like long books with interesting themes . I enjoyed getting to know the characters of the previous books even though I had to refer to a cheat sheet at times to keep them all straight . BUT This book was a nightmare of fog and misdirection . The introduction of new characters scattered my focus on the plotoh that 's right the plot was somewhere in the fog . I wanted to scream HODOR at times . Will there be some sort of last book that will finally make sense of it all ? One can hope . ",2
"I had a hard time putting this last book down . When you get so far in this series you want some closure on story lines but this one keeps you guessing and saying No ! They ca n't kill him ! I think Mr. Martin likes to keep his options open for more book to come . I know I 'd like to read more ! l ",4
"Honestly I feel fleeced the story has gone sour it has no motion to a conclusion find another series of books this is a rip off and waist of time . ",0
"I 'm glad I was able to read book 4 & book 5 at the same time . Unfortunatly book 6 has n't come out yet so of course you are left hanging . I 'm glad I had read the reviews first . I was n't as disappointed because I knew what to expect . ",3
"After thinking a little I have to say that I liked ADWD . I liked AFFC too but would have loved them to be only ONE book . That being said I 'm talking about ADWD nowArya Theon Bran Barristan AegonConnington and Jon 's chapters were a treat they 're all very well written and deep they added meaning to the tale and lived up each and every of my expectations . They actually are what I wanted . As many pointed out sadly the storylines all end at a cliffhanger but that 's only to be expected since we know there are at least another 2 oboks coming before the end.But there are a couple of things I did n't like at all the Tyrion and Dany chapters seem to be the biggest problem with this new instalment . It seems to me that both characters have changed in a way that is unsatisfying . Tyrion in this book seems to have lost all his cleverness and above all his wit I think here he has never said or done one single thing worth of the Tyrion we 've known so far he seem to have become a real freak and he he does n't care all he 's interested in is to find out where whores go . Ok he did what he did to his father but he seems to have done nothing out of it except becoming a very plain dull and predictable character which is exactly the contrary of what he has always been to the bone he never ever surprised me he sometimes BORED me instead and I say that even if I liked his voyage ! . The same I think happens with Dany . She HAD ALREADY grown from a little scared girl into a dragon or a dragonling if you prefer but now she wastes herself in not making her mind up . Never . On anything ! Ok she 's a teenager and I understand all she did with Daario which is very real as teenagers are concerned BUT but all the stuff she went through in Mereen without doing ANYTHING about it is imo out of character . I remember Dany becoming confident learning from whatever happened to her . and learning to make the best out of even the worst situations . She had become in a way strong . But here she does NOTHING except marrying a man and to think that she married him to heave some weight off her shoulders is almost unbelievable for what she had grown to be ! ! ! These I think are the real problem with the book two major characters who do n't quite resemble whom they have been ALWAYS regardless of any situations they were put in . You may say now that people change . My reply is yes they change but their DNA stays the same ! And this is what I felt that Tyrion and Dany 's DNA have been changed without any strongenough reason . ",3
"I ca n't believe it 's been 5 years since Feast For Crows . I do not want to be critical of GRRM because it does take time to write something as great as ASOIAF . In fact I hope that there will be more books in addition to the ones that have already been planned I will be sad when it all ends.The story moves forward a little in this book although at least half the book is written in parallel time to Feast For Crows but with different characters.Once again GRRM has included story line clues i.e . Melissandre 's prediction that John will be stabbed in the dark for us to identify . I know I 've missed some clues so I 'll be rereading Dance With Dragons again . I just hope that we wo n't have to wait another 5 years for the next book even though I know that it too will be worth the wait . ",3
"My grandson is reading this series . So had this book on his Christmas wish list . He has been trying to talk me into giving it to him early since the day it came in . ",4
"I thought Martin had hit rock bottom in the last book so I thought 'no where to go but up ' right ? WRONG ! Sideways is evidently a new direction for authors who have obviously never taken 10th grade English and do not know what plot sequence means.I do not know who the other 3000 or so people are who gave this book 34or 5 stars but they must be on someone 's payroll wink wink because this series is just getting worse and worse . Do not waste your money . I used an Amazon credit so thankfully I am not feeling too swindled . If you feel you must read this get it from the Library . ",0
"After reading the first four books I could not wait for this book in paperback . Hope book 6 arrives soon ",4
"Great book except that it 's another cliffhanger . Wish GRRM would pop them out a bit quicker . Maybe it will come out when I retire . ",4
"What can I say great series but I have to say thier may of been a little to much of detail . Other than that I read all the book and watched all the series on HBO that really needed more episodes to justify the books . Ca n't wait for the next book . Please be a bit kinder to the South Mr. Martin my best regards Lori ",4
"There are already a legion of critical reviews of this book out there but I 'll add one more since there seem to be quite a few obviously bogus 5star reviews on this site for the purposes of buffing the overall rating.Like many others I have been a fan of this series for more than ten years and have been anxiously awaiting A Dance With Dragons even though A Feast For Crows was a huge disappointment after the three fantasy masterpieces that opened this series . I told myself that perhaps AFFC was a misstep and that once ADWD came out all anxieties would be laid to rest because it would be another masterpiece . Wrong . This novel is tedious meandering needlessly vulgar and does not advance the story in any significant way at all . Keep in mind that I have read the first three books three times each so when I say that this book is a soporific it is coming from a former admirer of Mr. Martin . Several of the characters that we care about are not in this book at all but numerous characters and storylines that seem pointless and distracting are introduced . I find the land of Westeros fascinating but I do n't care enough to follow the life story of every minor noble and haberdasher in it which the author seems intent upon doing . Even worse the cruelty described in this book borders on grotesque . It 's as though Martin felt the need to spice up the already brutal violent borderline misogynistic legacy of this series in an effort to compensate for the feeble storytelling.I 'll stop here . Many others have gone into much more detail as to exactly what went wrong with this book and the previous one . Personally I can come up with only one conclusion George RR Martin does n't care about this series anymore or has completely lost control of it . Either way I 'm done with both this series and this author.If this thing wins the Hugo Award it will be a travesty . I wish it had ended as a trilogy with A Storm of Swords . ",1
"a page turner in the classic fashion GRR Martin has created an entire world for your pleasure . I was taken by surprise to find that this was n't the end . Waiting impatiently for the next installment . Awesome ! ",4
"Hurry up with the next books George I need to know what happens next ! Also love the TV series even though the Books are so much better ! ",4
"You would think that this book would be great considering how long it took Martin to write this sequel . I especially dislike the way it is repeating parts of stories that have already been told in A Feast for Crows . The first three books were much better . ",2
"Loved this book . I 've especially enjoyed chapters about 1 Jon Night Watch 2 TheonRamsay Bolton and even 3 Bran 's travel beyond the Wall.Tyrion and Daenarys did n't hold my interest as much as in the previous books . Cercei and Jamie are hardly present in this book.Hope that Jon Snow is still alive in the next book and Mr. Martin explores into his developing his skinchanger abilities and becoming a better leader of his people . He is an example of a good leader and a decent human being using his new found authority as a Lord Commander for benefit of the people . He is one of the most promising and fastest growing characters in the series.Story line about Bran 's travel North seeking a greenseer and eventually becoming one and merging into a tree and through one tree gaining an access to the network connecting all the wierwood trees in the North is very creative and raises interesting questions.This 5th book in the series is very long but absolutely worse reading it . Ca n't wait for the next book ! ",4
"A Dance with Dragons is a far more satisfying read than the previous novel A feast of Crows . It ties up a lot of the loose ends left in Feast and leaves the story in a very exciting place at the end.The focus shifts to Daenaries in the west and to Jon Snow on the walltwo of my favourite characters.It also revisits Arya I thought the end of Feast of Crows was particularly cruel to her . Strongly recommend . ",3
"George RR Martin 's epic ambitious series ` A Song of Ice and Fire ' has to be the closest creation to JRR Tolkien 's work for he has shown us such a creation that one could only dream of producing . This mammoth tale concludes with the largest book I have ever held within my hands being 1016 pages long that took me quite a few months to read . This grand epic saga has literally raised the bar high within its genre for many authors to aim to aspire to and which many are overwhelmed as it was not thought possible . Full of intensity electric tension and nailbiting suspense this book is one to completely and utterly loose yourself within and which pulls you in reminiscent of bait being lured into a tantalizing trap . Caught in a tangled web of interconnecting threads your mind will still be lost within the pages long after finishing reading this book . The sheer scale on which George RR Martin has achieved this assumed to be impossible feat Is just mindboggling and which really does blow you away instantly . Many other fantasy writers have taken one look at ` A song of ice and fire ' and have turned away shaking their heads in disbelief as they never thought it possible to have accomplished so much.To construct the twelve Caesars of fantasy fiction is astonishing and his wellcrafted characters and worldbuilding on such a scale is astounding . This colossal epic staggering series and concluding novel is just temptation itself and a delight for all fans of the fantasy genre who really want to ` stick their teeth ' into something complex and compelling . Capturing the intricacy of MiddleEarth with such vivid detail and history with characterdriven narrative that is as brutal and bloodthirsty as Conn Iggulden 's series about Caesar this is a masterful tale . Etched within your memory for alltime this imaginary world will become part of your own world as you revisit it time & time again.The future of the seven kingdoms hangs in the balance as on all sides bitter conflicts are reigniting which are played out by a band of outlaws and priests soldiers nobles and slaves . In the East fearsome Dragons rule the skies with the kingdom below built upon dust and death is plagued by deadly enemiesThe Dwarf Tyrion Lannister seeks out the Dragons as you travel to the North and the great wall of ice & stone where the wildling armies wait for an assault.The tides of destiny are slowly but surely washing in and coming closercloser to the end of all things .

"The Good the Bad and the.The GoodGRRM seems to have recovered from whatever ailed his efforts during A Feast for Crows . There 's far more action here and more exciting developments in this installment . And at long last we hear from the fanfavoritesTyrion Danaerys Arya Jon etc We also get to hear from several other interesting characters which are coming out of the background for the first time.Overall the development is satisfying but not savory . Almost like a glutenfree cookie . We get a taste of the world we love but there 's something subduing the flavor . It feels like the best bits have been withheld . Is this the reality of it ? I have no idea ! Just my impressionThe BadSome of my favorite characters got a really poor showing . Arya Jon and Bran were dealt some of the the most boring narratives despite their plots being among of the most exciting in the story.There were also a few plot turns that were a bit disappointing . Not anything particularly shocking just disappointing.The OtherWhile the title may tantalize you into thinking we may actually dance with dragons be at ease . The Feast for Crows continues albeit with a different cast of characters . There 's a lot of bookkeeping here background story telling and reminiscing of times past and relatively little of the here and now in Westeros.I sincerely hope the future novels will be edited with a forwardmarching purpose . While yes I will continue to read future installments I am beginning to doubt any true conclusion will be reached . It 's the song that never ends . ",3

"I 'd read the rest of the series and wanted to find out what happens next and anyone contemplating this book is likely in the same situation and willing to buy the book regardless of my review especially now that it is being discounted heavily . But man does this book DRAG . It has been a 2year gap since I read the book that comes before this one remember that the last book parallels this book so we are going two books back to the prequel . The book dances between multiple character threads and locations referencing plot developments that have faded in my memory . And it just goes on and on and on with angstridden wanderings and plots with little in the way of action . I 'm writing this at about the 13 point in the book so maybe things will pick up . If you 've read the rest of the series you 're going to have to read this one but it is n't literature.Edit I am editing this review after having just finished the book . The edit includes a downgrade from two stars to one and this additional material . This book is just horrible and I feel like I am being held hostage to whatever Martin wants to do because I 'd invested my time in the previous volumes and the story lines . I wanted to find out what happens to characters with whom I 've built relationships but still no joy and no resolutions . This book has no fewer than eight different plot lines going and each chapter jumps from one to another meaning that continuity within the book suffers . Further many of the plot lines are left over from previous volumes and given the time gap between this one and the latest it was difficult for me to remember what was going on the last time we visited some of the characters . Further the plot is dispersed so widely in both geography and characters that I am frankly having trouble keeping many of the minor players straight.Martin has woven a world that I am sure he understands but if you are looking for something to read with an ending do n't look to this series . Instead this is more like a multiyear TV show where you have to just tune in week after week to see what happens . But instead of following a close cast of characters through ongoing adventures Martin has created his full employment program by just broadening his world . I 'd have much rather he had created spin offs so I could at least have some resolution on part of the story.I 'll probably buy the next one if it ever comes out . But I certainly wo n't pay full price for it . I 'll wait again until it is deeply discounted for Kindle.For what it is worth this is the worst review I 've ever left and am not someone who goes around looking for problems or complaining just to complain . But I resent having my investment in this story and characters hijacked into a vehicle to sell me this unsatisfying content . ",0
"Perhaps Mr.Martin should have stopped at four.This book is not as interesting nor entertaining as the other four.I do not plan do buy a sixth book . ",3
"Once again George RR Martin does a great job of keeping me on the edge of my seat while reading and trying not to put the book down because I want to see what happens next . I 'm not going to ruin it for you all but I was disappointed with Mr. Martin 's choice of characters to kill off . You 'll have to read it to find out and I ca n't wait for the next book . ",4
"Unlike many readers I found A Feast for Crows and A Dance With Dragons great fun and great reading . It made me admire the writing of George R.R . Martin and I did n't worry about the lack of action . Martin said that the two books were background story that came before the ending he was planning . The books are essentially character development and I accept it as such . In this book two of my favorites are back Daenerys and Tyrion . Daenerys ' story is n't as compelling this time . She is ruling a free city name Mareen and has freed the slaves in the city . To prevent the other free cities from invading and retaking the people as slaves when she leaves she stays and plans to marry a wealthy man whose alliance would keep the city safe . We have already seen what marrying for love has done to Rob but what are the consequences and benefits to an arranged marriage without love or affection ? Tyrion has escaped King 's Landing and has been sent by Varys to join with Daenerys in the free cities . He runs into Jorah Mormont who captures him to give him as a hostage to Daenerys in order to please her . They meet up with a dwarf woman named Penny whose brother was murdered in the search for Tyrion . All three become slaves and perform as a sideshow for entertainment . Queen Cersei is having her own problems when she plans for Queen Margery to be accused of adultery and treason and finds herself in the same spot . Jamie now a nicer guy is riding up North and chooses to go off with Brienne in search of the Stark girls instead of intervening in Cersei 's behalf . Jon Snow is fighting off more wildlings and trying hard to not become embroiled in the War of the Five Kings . Stannis has taken over the Wall and is planning an attack on the South . Of course his unlikable personality is a huge problem . Meanwhile Tywin 's brother Kevan seems capable of solidifying Tommen 's reign into a kingdom people would actually want to live in . Strange as it may be I liked A Feast for Crows a bit better because I really grew to like the Stark girls and found their stories to be very moving and compassionate . Arya 's story does continue in this book but Sansa 's story was complete in the 4th book . The most compelling stories for me in this book were Tyrion and Cersei . Tyrion has had so much thrown at him all his life that life as a slave is tolerated with ease by him . He is always secure in his own right and very kind to both Penny and Mormont a sullen sad man who is his worst enemy . Cersei can also stand almost anything but seems to believe nothing will keep her down even when it appears evident that she is lost . I really look forward to the next installment and will have to wait years like many other fans . I enjoy the HBO series in the meantime . Love the series . ",4
"It is a good book . I like how it went back and explained some of the things that did n't make since or was left out in book four . I would recommend this book to anybody . ",4
"Why is there so little love for this release ? I found it all fantastic in fact better then the previous book book 4 A Feast for Crows.In any book there will some characters that are not as loved as others or get killed off and chapters that perhaps drag a bit but this series is a master work every bit is a bit more background for the entire story . Yes there were some cliff hangers from the previous book as in a 1950 's serial but all in all it is keeping me on the edge of my couch reading and wanting to know whatwhywhenhow . As long as the next two books or more rap things up with no glaring loose ends I will be happy and grateful to have the series to read . ",4
"This series DOES NOT qualify George Martin as the American Tolkien a quick review might more accurately say a book of bad menus weak plots plenty of fill to disturb the flow of what little story there is and overweening characters that are impossible to identify with unless you live your life on a teenage page of Facebook . If you 're a reader who thinks Robert Jordan lost his way with the Wheel of Time series or may be his editors were milking the money do n't read this book . ",0
"Finally ! Though the first few chapters were a bit slow this book once again showed the storytelling style I fell in love with in the first few books but seemed to have lost in the previous one . Ca n't wait for the next ! ",3
"In my opinion this is the second best book in the series the first one being my favorite . While some of my favorite characters did n't make it to book five there are still plenty of original characters still around . I do n't want to give any of the story away but I promise it is a good one.The story is more in depth as well as character involvement . There is never a dull moment in this book and it was very difficult to put down . Which is why I am surprised about the bad reviews . I loved this book and the cliff hanger in the end made me excited for book # 6 . Please give this one a try Im certain you will like it . ",4
"Wow ! This was painful to listen to . Roy Dotrice may have a wonderful speaking voice but his reading of Martin 's work was excruciating to endure.I 've no idea where or why he got the idea that all of Martin 's characters were either Scotish Highlanders or Cockney Louts with the occasional poorly done Sydney Greenstreet imitation thrown in for good measure but that 's about all that populate his rendering . As if that did n't rankle enough the man vocalized _all_ the women and I do mean _all_ the women as 14th century Irish tavern wenches . Even if they were n't smallfolk in the tale.Had this been my first exposure to what Martin created then I 'd have gone no further with it and stayed away from the rest in disgust.You would think that as successful as Martin has been with this series that they would 've gotten a more capable and fitting reader for his works.I hope they do so in the future as Dotrice is really an awful choice here .

"After a long wait of nearly six years since the publication of A Feast for Crows the fifth book in George R.R . Martin 's awardwinning bestselling A Song of Ice and Fire series A Dance with Dragons was released in July 2011.The entire A Song of Ice and Fire series has had a higher profile lately especially since HBO started airing a miniseries called Game of Thrones based on the first book A Game of Thrones . Their intention is to shoot each season of the series roughly based on each book in the series . Peter Dinklage won a very important Emmy award Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his portrayal of Tyrion Lannister one of the fan 's favorite characters.A Dance with Dragons was reviewed by all the major papers of record Los Angeles Times New York Times Time as well as the usual suspects of media outlets online generally positively . Among fans however the reviews are somewhat mixed with the feeling that the latest book is closer to A Feast for Crows than A Storm of Swords . To me that 's to be expected because the timeline of events that occurred in A Feast for Crows occupy about half of the book in A Dance with Dragons happily told from the perspective of the fan 's favorite characters . The problem with this is that not much progress was made on the huge seriesspanning plots like Daenerys ' march to Westeros from Essos John Snow 's attempts to maintain the Wall against the invasion of Creatures of the Frozen North Bran Stark 's destiny to actualize his magical talents and whether the Iron Throne will be controlled by someone who actually deserves the power and cherishes the people they rule just to name a few . By some counts there were around 11 central plots covered in just this book.On extended reflection I think my overall evaluation of the book is closer to the official reviewer ' than the fans ' . I 've only read A Dance with Dragons once but I would still rank it as the second best book of the series behind the impressive A Storm of Swords which is still the best of the bunch with A Dance with Dragons close behind followed by A Clash of Kings and A Game of Thrones the less said about A Feast for Crows the better.I had the good fortune of only starting to read the series in 2011 so I have not had to experience the halfdecade long wait for the next installment in the series . Sadly now that I have caught up with Martin 's production schedule I will have to comfort myself during the long wait for Book 6 widely reported to be titled The Winds of Winter by rereading the first five books and watching the excellent HBO television adaptations of the earlier books apparently each season of the series will be an adaptation of the corresponding book . Hopefully the next book will be out before the television series catches up with Martin ! Title A Dance with Dragons.Author George R.R .

"One of my favorite books of all times . What a great author and I do n't take my books lightly . LOVE it and recomend everyone to read the whole series ",4
"Book 4 and 5 are boringmy thought..read Kate Morris 's review . It is an excellent review . The author seems to let his imagination run wild as the story goes..all the characters are jokes now ",1
"This was the most disappointing instalment yet . I have this fear that Mr Martin is running out of steam on this series and that the TV series is becoming far larger than it should to add pressure . ",1
"I am hooked on this series of books and I like each one that I have read . I can hardly wait until the next installment is published . I do n't watch the TV series as I believe books are always better than the shows or movies . ",4
"More ! Ca n't put these down need to know endings . Love 'em . Awful to spend every waking moment reading love it ! ! ",4
"I have enjoyed all the previous volumes but the author has set himself a tough task and in volume five you can see what he 's up against he has to pull so many threads togetherand he ca n't help adding still more stories and charactersthat just writing a book is too much . So what we have in volume five is a set of structural necessities leavened with some of Martin 's irrepressible creativity which may be illadvised here.In sum if you are following the series you need to read this book . It is clearly the site of his gathering himself for the final push . It is interesting but not fascinating and compelling in the way that the first three and part of the fourth books were . But ok . It 's a heroic task he 's set himself and I 'm willing to recognize that sometimes you have to be workmanlike rather than brilliant . Volume 6 of the series will tell whether he 's just hitting his marks or is now on the race back to the barn . ",3
"I love the complex development of characters . This book could go on forever . I would never get tired of reading about it the lives of the characters . I would like to see some more development of the special powers some of the characters . ",4
"As I cracked open this book it occurred to me that I had not read a new Tyrion chapter in over TEN YEARS . That 's part of the problem.The first three books of this series were awesome . Martin set the bar very high.Book four was a disappointment but only relative to the first three . In preparations for this fifth volume I reread the first four . I was surprised by how much I liked the widelypanned book four . It 's still Martin . It 's still excellent . But the pace and story progress is much slower.Book five is a similar experience . There 's good stuff here but it 's slow in coming . With upward of a dozen pointofview characters nobody 's story moves particularly quickly.A lot of the criticism of this book is based upon expectations and frequency . If Martin released a book like this one every 1218 months most of his readers would be thrilled . It would be like a slow but steady march towards a conclusion . With a five year wait for book four and a six year wait for book five the lack of progress is excruciating . It 's like Stannis marching on Winterfell.There 's not much of a solution to this problem short of Martin putting more of his time into this series . The man is 62 years old and I for one do not want to read Brandon Sanderson 's ending to A Song of Ice and Fire . ",2
"It became dragging towards the end and lots of unfinished business Seems like GR Martin would still like to write a continuation otherwise he keeps us all hanging.. ",2
"I went from checking the book shops and sites for years to get the next installment . I waited so long that I had to be refreshed as to the characters.Finally this book came along and it was such a disappointment that if it takes him 20 years to produce another it wo n't bother me . What a drag this volume was . A struggle to read . I am not sure I even recognized some of the characters . A self absorbed effort from an author who appears to be dragging this out interminably . ",1
"One of the best pieces of writing I have ever read . I have read all the books in the series thus far and ca n't wait for winds of winter ",4
"This was good but it has a tendency to ramble in spots . I do look forward to the next installment . ",3
".save your money and borrow from the library or a friend . You will need to renewand renewand renew . It moves THAT slowly . It 's not terrible just not good . It is a disappointing step in the series . I have it on my Nook so if I 'm completely bonkers bored or stuck on the subway I may pick it up and plod on . Or I may do something more interesting like contemplate my shoelaces . ",1
"have not read all of it but where can you go wrong with dragons ? you can not not to me . wish I lived in those days but as a dragon . lol ",4
"I hate buying a series that takes years to complete . This may or may not be the last book as in reading the intro by the author he was alluding to another book to come.So far it is a little confusing since the last book I reread was number 4 this is number 5 and I do ot remember all the characters and 5 is supposed to be going on at the same time number 4 was.I want to know how it ends so I will continue to read it but if you have not started yet wait till HBO finishes the miniseries then you can buy the books . ",2
"The writers leaves you wanting more wondering who are the real players in the game of thrones and who are moving all the pieces I ca n't wait for the final two books ",4
"i loved the first three books in the seriescould n't put them down and looked forward to books four and fivefour left the storyline and bactracked and five was n't much better as it did n't end the series nor tie up enough ends so that this reader felt satisfiedthat said i will probably buy the next book if and when there is one to see what happens ",2
"I fear I 'll be too old to read the next installment as long as it takes him to write each one and he 's no spring chicken . I enjoy his epic fantasy series except I 've grown tired of the tedium of readinglearning names that will end up meaning nothing as the character will get killed off . Anyone you care about in the series is bound to die or wander off into a storyline with it 's epic creation of weird names . I just wish Martin would focus and move the storyline forward a little quicker the way it 's written HBO will need to modify various storylines to maintain interest . Good book but ultimately annoying in that nothing is really resolved and more people you care for are killed . ",3
"A Dance With Dragons is wonderful and a worthy link in the Ice and Fire chain . It is exciting and paints several unforgettable and vivid scenes which is more than most books are able to do . Mr Martin has created a fully imagined world and I can not believe that it has not been enjoyed by all who have read it maybe those who did not like it could not finish for one iterate reason or another I found it to be a wonderful part of a modern masterpiece ",4
"No . 5 in the series is a real stepup and Martin displays his very best.However just as so many characters were missed in number 4 those in the preceding novel were missed here . Not a great choice to split as he chose to so I hope Martin does not do so again.Unlike many 'series ' novels this one absolutely only works in the greater pictureStill GAME fans will love it . Looking forward to number 6 and picking up where this and no . 4 left off . ",4
"With already thousands of comments about the book what more is there to say ? While reading the book I am totally engrossed . Each chapter is well written with lots of details and interesting.The problems are Characters continue to be added to the point that it is hard to remember who is who . there are multipe kings queens and princes and more knights than one can imagine . There are multiple companies of sellswords . The are multiple free cities each with their retinue of stange sounding advisors and leaders . There are at least 4 major religions and an uncountable number of gods . There are as many plots & schemes as their are charcters . It is not uncommon for a character be drowned stabbed or knocked out at the end of a chapter only to be found alive several chapters later.Two characters who have not seen since the end of book 3 show up at the end of book 5 . Game of Thrones has become like a lot of TV shows that start off amazing but in their suprise popularity jump off the tracks in trying to keep fans interested e.g . Lost.I am not sure if George Martin has it all planned out or is just winging it at this point but it would seem the vast majority of fans myself included would like to see the focus narrow not broaden . He has built a truly amazing universe . If he could just use the next book or 2 to allow some closure to many of the stories and stabilization to the rule of Westeros he can then he keep writing books of new adventures uprisings and stories of different characters and regions . Let 's hope this happens . ",2
"Really enjoyed reading this . Loved having it on the Kindle all my previous reads were paperbound versions . On Kindle was able to read it anywhere including while at work walking down the hall between meetings . ",4
"George Martin delivers books with rich characters and labyrinthine story telling . This is not a formula for everyone but for those who enjoy it there is no one who does it better . Book five is a better than average example of his storytelling prowess . Lets face it a story with something like 1500 named characters takes an investment from the reader but those who make the investment will find themselves making an hour or two every day to read the next chapter or two and all the days together add up to more pleasure per hour than anything else you can do with your time . Do n't for heavens sake begin the journey with this bookstart with book onewinter is coming ! ",4
"I am so over these books . I am almost positive that he wrote this without an outline it wanders . Martin is at best a mediocre talent and this book will completely cure your insomnia . ",0
"Like the preceding books in this amazing series A Dance with Dragons is rich twisty gritty and totally engrossing . It comes through on Martin 's promise to return the reader to the lifelines of major characters that were largely missing from Feast of Crows . Unfortunately many of the major characters that are most appealing at least to me remain at points in their lives where they are not involved in the central picture in any discernable way . In other words although things continue to happen in their lives they are not moving the overall picture forward . I can not get specific here without spoiling the story for someoneI am also unhappy to say that this book like the others in this series ends without an ending . In some great series the author manages not only to write an overall story arc that ends satisfyingly but also manages to make each book independent and satisfyingly ended unto themselves . Barbara Hambly 's series that begins with Dragonsbane comes to mind as a magnificent example . Sharon Shinn 's Archangel series is another example though Hambly I have to say is the writer with far greater range . When a reader already knows that it may be multiple years before the next book that 's downright cruel ! But this is a story well worth a bit of suffering ! I will definitely be in line at the end of the 5 years or whatever it takes to get to the next book . ",4
"This story runs concurrently with the previous book . I especially like Jon who was stabbed by five or seven men in the previous book . Near the end 0f A Dance with Dragons he is stabbed by several people . That was very discouraging to me . Did he die and go on to be one of the undead ? Was he miraculously saved as his treacherous step mother was ? ",2
"Neil Gaiman responding to readers complaining about the Martin situation back in 2009 stated that Martin is not working for his readers . Let the little people keep buying and suffer in silence.Gaiman is an idiot.I am lucky in that I started reading the series just eight weeks ago which is how long it took me to finish book five . If I had started reading back in 1996 and had to wait the seven years between the superb book 3 and the lackluster books 45 I would be livid beyond words . No spoilers here only the sad fact that as too many have noted Martin takes 2000 pages to get little done . Yes the competent prose is still there but prose was never Martin 's strong point . His strong point was character plot drive . There is some minor development in books 4 and 5 but that 's about it . To take seven years and 2000 pages to accomplish just that is unforgivable for an author . Forget the readers the characters deserve better . The series deserves better.Even a mildly competent editor could have pared these two books down to a single volume . Doing so could have saved the series . Sadly this did not happen . If it did not happen for books 4 and 5 it probably will not happen for books 6 and 7 . That means we are looking at a wrecked series . I do n't know if Martin is capable of bringing what is now a mess back on track I 'll wait to hear some reader responses before buying the next book . ",1
"Today just to prove a point I read the opening of Game of Thrones . There is no denying through the series GRRM 's writing has become careless and unwieldy . Hi He resorts to having characters repeat the same stale catch phrase again and again and again.Dany I am only a young girl who knows little in the ways of warTyrion Where do whores goBarristan Selmy I am too old for thisTheon Reek Reek rhymes with leekmeekweak..And so on..Like the storyline the prose stalled and lumbered . Yet that was n't the biggest sin . What of our favourite characters ? SPOILERS.Tyrion the cunning influencer the unsung hero of Blackwater has just a couple of talents remaining making big people laugh and being an obedient good little dwarf . He takes to the role of the slave as if he 's prepared all his life for it . Serving at feasts riding a pig wiping his big master 's bottom would n't any regular lordling learn all that growing up a possible heir to the richest family in Westeros ? Dany OK she wanted to rule . But she does n't . Some days she ca n't be bothered to hold court . She wants to float in her tub under the persimmon tree and lounge around her terrace watching the pyramids of Meereen . And choose outfits to greet Daario in she 's only a young girl who knows nothing in the way of war ! She does n't execute a single person despite her own people falling like flies and that 's the same girl who nailed a hundred slave masters to crosses as a payback for slave children murdered in the same way who sacked Astapor after cheating its masters out of the Unsullied the girl had crossed deserts and conquered cities on her way to win back the Westeros throne . About thatIt 's all about peace now man.Bran becoming a tree ? Really ? The boy has crossed into the North Lands to get his legs back and the best he can get is the offer of even less mobility.Arya morphing into a chick from Kill Bill . Not that it is a bad storyline on its own but having spent two books trying to find her family anyone this leaves me a bit bewildered that she makes no attempt to get news about any of them . She knows that Jon and Sansa are alive and seems to have made a choice to forget about them . She enters this book as the Faceless Men wan na be and exits as the Faceless Men wannabe . How far she 's come ! Jon knifed . OK most theories seem to agree that he wo n't die but you have to wonder why GRRM created such a noble proud house populated by people you want to know more and more about only to wipe out most of them so early in the series maim and rain misery on the rest for the remainder of it.Jamie appears only to tell us he is galloping off to join Briennenot without telling us again that Cersei has done Lancel and Osney and possibly Moonboy..As a tradeoff GRRM unleashes a plethora of inconsequential background characters some of whom are quite disgusting to make matters worse . Victarion comes to mind brutish cruel stupid man . His casual cruelty and abuse towards his dusky woman was quite painful to read about . Why oh why do we need to know about him ? Look it is still a good read . It is still an amazing universe of characters cities and events still epic in its depth . I will still be buying the next book if it ever comes out . But GRRM needs to cull and spare us the scum of Westeros . I 've come too far now to stop reading if I look back I am lost ! ",3
"My expectations remained just that expectations . Did not enjoy the book . I would have prefered to see the book continue in the same way as the rest of the books . ",1
"Incredible look forward to the next one . Kept me up nights wondering what was coming next . Have read all five books in the series and ready for book number five . ",4
"Nuff said . George R. R. Martin is awesome . I am just writing these words to fill the minimum requirements . Done . ",4
"I wo n't rehash the plot and I agree with many of the reviewers book five simply does not live up the excitement grandeur or promise of the first three books . Honestly I just plodded along till the end because I 'd spent good money on this book . GRRM will have to really breathe fire into the promised two books in the series I expect that most of his die hard fans will await and then read them but I 'm no longer excited . ",2
"I just started reading this book . It is great so far I do n't want to put it down.I would recommend this book and the other four to anyone who likes swords knights kings and dragons . ",3
"These low ratings are ridiculous . The book is a little slow in the beginning but it picks up before half way and is just as good as the other books after that . Book 1 was the same way slow at first then picking up . People are just mad because the stories are n't resolved and the book took too long to come out . But it is NOT a bad book . I really enjoyed it and was n't disappointed at all . It may not be my favorite of the series but it does belong in the series . This is not like what happened with Robert Jordan 's books which became unreadable after a while . Do n't be afraid to buy this book if you love this series then you will enjoy it . ",4
"The first and second books I gave them a 5 star while book three a 4 and the fourth book 35 . The firts two books I enjoyed the most because are well written have interesting plot twists and genius creativity with dialogues while the third and forth have problems regarding the plot not advancing so much although the third book have two of the best moments of the entire series.The fifth book is a problematic one because while you will find the good elements well written very good dialogues a few plot twists the number of cliffhangers is just too annoying and there are no impactful scenes like the first three books.On the other hand you could see a more well rounded product as the only truly boring parts were the endless descriptions of food.It 's a four star book even though this one is probably the book with less impactful scenes . ",3
"Still reading and loving every page and every word . Its the first book in a long time that I could n't predict how it will end . ",4
"I perhaps should n't rate this book since I stopped reading about 100 pages in . I was bored ! I may revisit it sometime but I think the core four books were far superior . ",1
"It 's hard to overstate just how much I have been anticipating this book . Certainly since Martin 's A Storm of Swords I have been eagerly awaiting the continuation and perhaps resolution of plots set in motion by the Red Wedding Jon Snow 's ascension to lead the Night 's Watch and Daenerys ' capture of Meereen . Well after finishing the book yesterday and a literally sleepless night over how upset I was by certain deaths I almost wish I had n't read it.Let 's start at the beginning . I 'll try to keep this review spoilerfree . First the good stuff.George R. R. Martin excels at making you care about these characters . All of people major and minor have the ring of truth about them . They feel real you care about them or hate them but you understand them . I do n't think anyone does this better than GRRM . The dragons are growing up and when they appear on the page they are vivid fascinating monsters a world away from the empathetic beasts of McCaffrey or Novik . GRRM also delights in playing with reader expectations . No one is safe in this A Song of Ice and Fire feels more like a horror story than traditional fantasy . Finally the world is gritty and real in a way fantasy simply was n't before outside of a few Sword and Sorcery tales from Leiber or Howard . Martin is telling a huge tale and I ca n't think of anyone else telling a story this big this successfully . That said Martin 's reach exceeds his grasp or so it seems at this point.The book follows three main plot threads with a spattering of scenes that advance the story a tick from A Feast for Crows . The first is Tyrion 's trajectory from Westeros to Daenerys . The second is Jon Snow 's struggles leading the Night 's Watch and preparing for the coming of Winter and the White Walkers . The third is Daenerys ' attempts to rule Meereen . An honorable mention should be made for Quentyn Martell 's attempt to reach and woo Daenerys but this plot line is buried in the latter half of the book . Additionally we have Stannis Baratheon 's struggle in the North the fate of the Iron Born in the north the ascendancy of House Ramsay and Frey the fallout from Queen Cerci 's stupidity Davos Seaworth 's attempt to woo House Manderley the fate of Bran and Rickon Stark and last but not least a new appearance of a Targaryen quite literally out of nowhere . This does n't include additional plot threads that also poke their heads up from A Feast for Crows . As you can see there 's a lot going on here.One of the things that makes this book so frustrating is how few plots are resolved or even moved along significantly . A Dance with Dragons feels like half a book despite its heroic size . There is so much going on that there simply is n't enough progress accomplished . I have to question some of the plot lines Martin chose to write . Sorry but there it is . Readers hoping that there would be a resolution of the legendary Meereenese knot that tied GRRM up and stranded Daenerys a world away from the main action in Westeros will be disappointed . Not only by the fact the Daenerys show no sign of going to Westeros but by the fact she 's not even in the third act of the book . Battles between the Boltons and Stannis are literally bogged down and left unresolved on the page making a mysterious note from Ramsay Bolton nee Snow at the end of Jon 's chapter ambiguous to say the least . Tyrion never even meets Daenerys let alone advises her . The Martel plot is so futile and unreceived that I wonder why Martin bothered to write it . Almost NOTHING is settled in this book . We are given cliffhangers and ` downer endings ' but few resolutions . We are n't even moving towards resolution and with only two books left supposedly that is worrying . Two plot threads appear to be resolved in the most final way possible which leads me to my second problem with the book.There has been a recurring theme that those who try to do good who try to act honorably will be killed mutilated and disgraced . Time and again characters you know and love and sympathize with are cut down corrupted maimed and murdered . A Dance with Dragons continues this fine tradition . Martin is nothing if not consistent . Again and again in this series characters are warned but ignore these warnings to their doom . In a way this is a classical tragedy where a character 's flaw or virtues even bring about their destruction . Or virtuesthat 's not the way it 's supposed to work . Flaw yes . In classical tragedy a character is supposed to fail due to their tragic flaw . In Martin 's world there are tragic virtues . Like Honor . Honesty . Compassion . Decency . Humanity . Loyalty . Any of these qualities will get you killed in these books . The characters that thrive are the most devious the most ruthless the liars the torturers and the corrupt . I am weary from watching good men die and watching good women suffer . At this point I 'm not sure who I should be rooting for or if I should even keep reading.I will of course . Martin is writing the epic fantasy of the past fifty years . Even if it fails it will be an epic failure and be worth watching in the same way that watching Rome burn must have been worth seeing.In addition to the betrayal murder and torture there 's the sex . Now I 'm no prude I write about sex and violence in no small amount myself . However this book is particularly drenched in sex and for gratuitous reasons it seems . There are long loving descriptions of random naked women we never see again . Rape and near rape both on the page and ` off stage ' . Sodomy is mentioned frequently among Eastern kingdoms and sell sword companies . There 's always been a lot of sex and deviant sex at that in this series . So I 'm sure most readers wo n't be put off at this point but brace yourself . There 's a lot of sex in this book.Do I recommend the book ? It hardly matters . Readers have been waiting 68 years for this book depending on how you look at it . It is essential and that makes it a crying shame . It is wellwritten though not quite to the levels in the first three books . I worry that the seven books we 've been promised will sprawl further as the later Robert Jordan 's Wheel of Time series did . This is epic fantasy and epic tragedy . ",3
"Ca n't put the book down . Keep em coming . Quite possibly one of the best series of books that I have read in a long time . ",4
"Pages and pages of meaningless details and dozens of characters who go nowhere like book 4 . What a shame after the promise of books 13 . ",1
"I 'm not investing anymore time or money in this series . 5 years between books and the author coughs up this Hairball . George needs to get over himself . ",1
"The last unfortunately book of the series did not disappoint me and to some degree satisfied the nagging question what next ? . However at the end one is left with a world in turmoil many characters still in process of reaching their goal . I wish I could force Mr. Martin to continue with this saga . ",3
"While I do understand the disappointment of many readers of ADWD I ca n't help but disagree . Perhaps this is because I did n't start reading the novels in the 1990s and read them all straight through in a row . I also know that there will be 7 books in the series which made me not expect a complete resolution by the end of this book . What I think Feast and Dance do accomplish is to broaden the spectrum of the fantasy world in which all of these events are occurring introduce new characters some of which I liked some of which I found dull but could tell that in the greater context they would eventually become important . I am not going to put in any spoilers because I read one idiots review of this book that ruined a major event for me but I can say that it has plenty of action as well as prophecy . I can also say it has plenty of slow moving chapters as well . Not every chapter in the books can be exciting and action packed when you are portraying such a vast viewpoint of a completely different world from the eyes of many . I think the biggest problem people have with Feast and Dance is that they are not nearly as Starkcentralized narratives . While the Starks were the first family of honor and the protagonists that we were introduced to a complex story of this size would be boring if it only revolved around them . That is what makes A Song of Ice and Fire unique . The good guys do n't always win . It makes fantasy more realistic . I probably agree with some that certain charatcers did not need POV chapters their stories could have been told through other 's POVs . But it is what it is . and the 4th and 5th books of the series are setting up what will hopefully be a fantastic finish in the 6th and 7th as we continue to explore this wonderful world that Martin has created . That being said if you are very emotionally attached to the Starks and do n't find other characters as interesting it is pretty much OK to stop at Book 3 . You wo n't be disappointed and HBO will show you their version of the rest of the story anyway . So if Feast and a Dan are daunting skip them . But bashing them is irrational as they are a logical progression of the story addressing the world outside of Westeros Winterfell and Kings Landing . ",3
"By now you 've probably read all of the lukewarm reviews of Dance with Dragons.This is yet another . But I think I know what 's going on.GRRM needs two very important things to happen before he can move the story forward . Both of these things take time.First he needs for winter to come . All of the dangers hinted at beyond the wall only stir in the dead of winter.Second and most importantly he needs Dany 's dragons to grow up . She ca n't very well march into Westeros with three dragons the size of ponies.Both of these things have happened by the end of Dance with Dragons . And not much else.Looked at this way the entirety of Dance with Dragons could be summed up with the words Eighteen Months Later Aside from that GRRM has given us maybe 300 pages of story wrapped up 1000 pages of book.So I would rate Dance with Dragons as completely skipable . It 's okay but do n't expect much to happen . We really are just waiting for time to pass.That said the chapters with Tyrion were a little troubling . Without much story our favorite halfman was left wandering around getting into pointless adventures and making wisecracks . GRRM would honestly truly done everyone a favor Tyrion especially by just leaving these chapters out altogether.Finally I 'm glad I read Dance . I 'm a huge fan of GRRM and the series.But in the end it 's the weather and the dragons that are the stars of this book.If you set your expectations accordingly it 's worth a read . ",2
"Love all the books as well as the HBO series . I am hooked these are long books but I read all of them start to finish in a couple of months . Captivating the HBO series follows pretty closely . Only complaint I have on the series as a whole The story is n't finished and while I am happy to continue reading I worry Martin wont be able to finish . Love it ! ",4
"What can I say ? This bookseries is great ! ! ! ! The book arrived on time the cost was reasonable . I would suggest reading all the books as opposed to just watching the HBO series as the writers of the show do not follow the book 's storyline . ",4
"I do n't know about you but one of the reasons I got a kindle was that online books were cheaper . The paperback is selling for 9.99 but the kindle is 14.99 . I will wait thank you very much . ",0
"A Dance with Dragons just left me wanting moreas every other novel in the series has . The only problem this time is that I ca n't currently have any more as the next book has not yet been published ",4
"I fell for the series hook line and sinker . Mycomplaint is that I have to wait for the nextbook to come out . This is the fifth book in theGame of Thrones series . Actually I could complainthat my favorite characters are gone or thatthe story of power and domination resemblelife today for many around the world . The booksare unpredictable captivating and totally withoutregard for my wish for happy endings and justicefor all . So perhaps because of that rather than inspiteof those things I tremendously enjoy this series . ",4
"I looked forward to reading Book 5 A Dance with Dragons in the Song of Ice and Fire series . I was eager to learn what happened to characters from past books . After reading the entire book I was disappointed to find that I still am looking for the answers . ",2
"I just finished A Dance with Dragons and the first thing I said when I did was He has got to finish this series I started reading this series after watching the first episode of the series on HBO . I have fallen in love with the characters and I am a fan of the writing style and the way that while reading Game of Thrones I felt like I was being beckoned into a world that I felt a kinship to . It 's all very Machiavellian the style of these books everyone is striving to end up on top and the people who are not trying to win end up being crushed under foot . In this book I found that the characters that I have come to care about are being drawn to a precipice and they will end up on the winning side or the losing side . There were new characters including a unforeseen player in this game that for all intents and purposes has been hiding in the wings of this story waiting to come out and change the game . I want to say that I understand that some people are particularly fond of the time that it takes for these books to come out but to be honest no fantasy series since Lord Of The Rings has completely pulled me into the mind of the writer . Tyrion is at his best being a man who is underestimated but always manages to come out on top Cersi is down but I do n't think for the count . The 'spider ' is up to his old tricks because like Tyrion he is underestimated . It 's still anyone 's game but who will win and who will die ? ",4
"Looked forward to this for many years . Now that I have started it I am not sure I will go to the end . This is because I do n't think anything will happen . In the first 500 pages we have not gotten anywhere . Nothing looks to be close to resolution . Characters are either struting in place or wandering aimlessly.I can put up with Dave Weber 's data dumps because you know that something will happen by the end of the book . After the previous book I had my doubts we would get any answers . Now I am almost sure that we will be wondering we this book was written when we finished it . ",1
"I read G.R.R.Martin 's Song of Ice and Fire Series several years ago and loved them . I reread them recently to prepare not only for the publication of A Dance With Dragons but also before I watched the HBO series starting with A Game of Thrones . I was excited at the prospect of a new chapter in Stark and Lannister lives but I was very disappointed . It seemed as if he had written his first draft chopped it down to 995 pages and given it to his publishers without editing or reviewing the content . Had I not read his first four novels in the series I would n't have read past Chapter Five . Yes he warned his fans some of the characters from the earlier books would not appear in this book but their stories would be taken up in Book 6 . That was n't the issue . It was the lackluster job he did presenting the characters that he did include and their sloppy story lines.Martin has an amazing ability to build credible fascinating characters that you love or love to hate . Tyrion for example is flawed physically but possesses his father 's intellect and political savvy without the inherent evil and lust for power or a sibling ! . Not so in this book . The insight wisdom and basic goodness are just not apparent and I am not looking forward to seeing him joust on a pig 's back when HBO gets to the fifth series . Meanwhile Brandon Stark wanders north guided by guardians we still know almost nothing about and seems content to become a tree . Jon Snow newly elected to command the Watchers on the Wall is taken out by those who just elected him . Stannis Baratheon is determined to take Winterfell back to rescue the Arya substitute from Roose Bolton 's son but nothing happens other than a seige of sorts defeated by the weather . Ramsay Bolton gets far more ink than he merits and there is way too much detail of his sadistic treatment of Reek . We would have picked up that he was a bad person without chapters of gory details that do nothing to move the plot along.. I would much rather know why Theon turned on the family he grew up with and betrayed them.Explicit sex and violence were part of the first four books . They helped paint a picture of an earlier civilization where life was short and often brutal and you took your pleasures where you found them while you could . A Dance with Dragons just wallows in brutality sadism and any chance of having sex anywhere anyhow with anyone . It was n't offensive or shocking in the earlier book nor was it boring . Sadly not the same could be said about this book.The worst thing was that the story did n't get anywhere nothing was resolved and new characters with their own previously unheard story lines were added to confuse the issue . So the dragons escaped so the Sand Vipers were released so Cersei got a little of what we had hoped was coming to her while Jaime appears to be turning to good side of the force under Brienne 's influence ! After 900+ pages it did n't really matter . The only part of the book that I really liked was Arya 's story and her trials and growth in The House of the Dead.I think if Martin had taken another year to take the manuscript he had and plan more carefully how to divide it into books five and six he could only have improved his fifth offering . I ca n't see why the haste when the first HBO series is so successful and so many of us aching for round two we would have still rushed out to buy Book Five . I doubt I will buy Book Six . I will probably get it out of the library and buy my own copy if it is as good as the first four in the series . ",1
"I loved the first 3 books . This one was interesting in a way but disappointing also . The introduction of the new characters some from feast for crows made me feel as if the author is just stretching the story loose ends that hopefully will be tied up in book 6 . I look forward to the new book and hope that we wo n't have to wait so many years before we can continue reading it.It appears as if Jon Snow has been killed . I hope not he is an interesting character like his father and the other members of the Stark family . ",0
"Read all five books . A detailed and engrossing series that maintains interest throughout . They are a significant investment of time but well worth it ",4
"Great follow on to Book Four as it continues the lust for the throne . I found some real surprises in this book that I was n't expecting and was very pleased with them . I am looking forward to the next book in the series . I understand that there is one and maybe two more to the series . You will be completely engrosses in this series so start with book one . It takes a little time to get into it and get the characters straight but it is well worth the read . I highly recommend this book as well as the entire series . ",4
"I almost feel like not a whole lot of shocking things happened in this book . I still love the series through ! ",2
"Love the story line in all of these books . Especially like how the dragons start coming of age and what they can now do . Ca n't wait for the next book to come out to see what happens . ",4
"I do n't know if I enjoyed this book because I disliked ` A Feast for Crows ' so immensely or because it was actually decent . Or perhaps it is neither . I was able to enjoy this book for what it was because I read ` A Cavil on Chronology ' a brief from Martin in the beginning of the book that says there will be another to follow . With this knowledge I did not expect any resolution I was just along for the ride.That being said Martin is longwinded . If you 're going to read the series it just comes with the territory . Accepting this I still ca n't get past the feeling that he wastes a lot of the reader 's time with chapters that ultimately prove to be unimportant which is why I found myself skimming over a good bit of AFFC . But hey if you 're writing a moneymaking series would n't you want to drag out the story over as many books as possible ? Guess he learned a thing or two from Robert Jordan.Some of the character 's conflicts however simply do n't make sense . For example when Stannis offers Jon Snow a lordship at Winterfell Jon struggles with the decision . Even after he declines the offer he laments what could have been . What I do n't get is how Jon ever believed Stannis had the power and authority to offer such a prize when he was fully aware of how few in the realm supported Stannis ' cause . On the subject of power and support how could the people of the iron islands be so delusional as to think they had any chance of conquering and ruling Westeros ? I mean what the hell ? And what 's with Tyrion ? In the first three books we come to know him as a sharp witty and ultimately honorable man . Then suddenly he is a kinslayer who wants to murder a few other relatives and is riddled with wretched thoughts . It 's like he turned into Cersei.It was nice to get back in touch with some characters and there was at least a mention of Rickon who seemed to have fallen off the face of planet . I found myself wondering ` What 's the main idea of this series ? ' The answer seems to be Rule Westeros though with the way things are going it wo n't be much of a prize when all is said and done . The first book endears us to the Starks so we 're going to root for them right ? Yet their position in the kingdom as it stands now is tenuous at best . Has Daenerys become the character we are now supposed to hope ` wins ' ? At this point I 'm not sure what outcome I 'm supposed to be hoping for based on how Martin has set up and developed the story . And that 's one of my big problems with him as a writer at least with regard to ` A Song of Ice and Fire'.The series is interesting enough to keep me reading though if we have another volume like AFFC I 'll be pretty wroth . I acknowledge why he broke up the last two books the way he did but I 'm not sure it was the best storytelling strategy . Also if you have to explain the screwed up timeline before a reader dives in then perhaps you might want to rethink things . Plus it would move the story along more seamlessly if we did n't have to keep jumping back and forth in time and we would n't have to wait as long to see what our favorite characters are up to . There 's no telling how he will choose to divvy up the story lines in the next book but here 's hoping it is a more blended effort.less edit ",2
"If the author does not bring back Jo snow I will delete all these books . Just when I think all is going well VARYS comes back ",3
"I loved this series . Unfortunately this book left me waiting for more . Thankfully the HBO series is filling the time while I wait or George Martin 's next two books to be written . Book 5 if quite a bit darker than the previous four books but as they say Winter is Coming . This story sticks with you . ",4
"Do n't get me wrong . I loved books one two and three . LOVED them . After reading book four I had a strong feeling that Martin was going off the deep end . Chapter after chapter of crap I did n't care about hundreds of pages of back story download useless information useless characters gobs of side stores and adventures only to finally culminate in disaster for EVERYONE I DID care about.Still I had hope . I thought this HAS to get better.So on to book five . The first quarter of the book is a trial . Again hundreds of pages of back story blather much of it about characters that were minor in the first books but suddenly are the central figures in the series for no apparent reason . Theon Greyjoy ? Really ? Why ? Suddenly some old knight that got retired in book one gets page after page of point of view a new princeling gets his own storyline . Meanwhile the characters you really want to know about are forgotten pushed to the wayside no longer worthy of a page or two when their stories are what made you struggle through all that back story to get to in the first place.STILL I had hope . So I plowed through the rest of book six only to be totally and completely furious with what he does in every single storyline . It 's almost as if Martin wanted to lose the fantastic readership he had in the beginning . What was he thinking ? When you start off a series with a handful of characters the readers love then KILL EVERY SINGLE ONE you 've got to at some point say enough is enough . Did any of his editors try to reign him in ? ? Did anyone say . you know do we HAVE to kill off this guy ? We all really like him . Or ca n't we get a little more of THIS person 's story ? Her character is interesting and the story is great does she HAVE to go through this bloody hell you 've designed for her ? It would be one thing if he replaced the characters we LOVED with MORE characters we love but no . Most are simpering directionless two dimensional nuisances that take the place of fully fleshed out personalities like Eddard Stark Rob Stark Brianne the Maid of Tarth not to mention Jon SnowOh we get a lot of Jon Snow in book five . But take one guess what happens to him ! I want them back . I want them all back because the dregs we are left with offer nothing of appeal for me.It seems in Martin 's world all the good guys die . Everything bad you can expect to happen will . Evil rules the land . We 're left with a place no decent person would want to be . If I have the ability to leave a world that seems fraught with nothing but senseless killing rape murder disease I think I will choose to leave it.Which is why I wo n't be scrambling to read book six if there is one . It 's time to get out of this worldbefore I get myself killed like everyone else does . ",0
"I have been a Game of Thrones junkie since first watching on a free weekend of premium channel . I must say that I have felt somewhat mired down in this book . I am introduced to a new character whose name I of course can not pronounce . I am given the most intimate details of his armor his hair color his family tree going back for hundreds of years and the size of his tallywacker only to never hear of him again . I zoomed through the first four books like a tornado through Tennessee and this book did not have the magic for me . I put it aside for a few months and then picked it up again . Perhaps I was over doing the Game a bit and had mired myself no fault of Martin's.I enjoyed it . It was worth reading to keep going with the series . I think that often authors who have a story going on for books on end have to fabricate pages of useless information just to keep the publisher happy . I 'm looking forward to the next and apparently last chapters . It is definitely entertaining and worth spending more time with all these fabulous characters just to see where they fall in The Game Of Thrones.M.S . Munro ",3
"I have read all previous Game of Thrones by R.R . Martin . When one of the protagonists was to the eye killed off at the end I put the book down and did not want to read any more of the series . Why does he have to kill off those to whom we become attached ? ",4
"This book was a little too rambling for a five star rating but good none the less . It IS an epic tale after all . Martin at least gives us glimpses of all the main characters whereas in FFC 's he left some out entirely . The frustration comes mainly in anticipating what comes next and we will have to wait a while to find out . Martin has set up some foreshadowing I hope concerning one of the main characters but he has never promised us even in the first book that those characters we know and love will make it to the end . Whether he is pruning characters to make the last battle solely between good and evil or just playing with us remains to be seen . I am invested in the story and will see it to the bitter or triumphant end . At least I will have the HBO series to keep me company while he writes the conclusion . ",3
"Loved the first four books . This one was long and boring but I felt I had to plow through it just in case the next book in the series was of the quality of the first four.Not sure exactly where this saga will continue from here but the characters that remain seem shells of their former selves . Most of the attractive characters have died.George Martin is a wonderful fantasy writer and I 'm always amazed at how he presents a huge cast of characters to the reader without confusion . ",2
"It is understandable when one considers the fact of how long a gap there was between Feast for crows and A Dance with Dragons that many people are going to be disappointed . When you 're an author you ca n't have it both ways you have to choosemake compromise between what hardcore fans expect and your own artistic integrity andor vision . Before the HBO show started I was n't sure that anyone still reading this series is n't a hardcore fan you 'd have to be pretty persistent to remain around Westeros for this long . Nowadays things are a bit different . I do n't consider myself to be a hardcore fan of this series . I liked what Martin did in first three books I even liked the fourth one despite angry mob being angry for no apparent reason but the fifth one takes the whole oh my god moment to a new level . After waiting for so many years one ca n't but be disappointed . There are many good things in this book Martin still knows his storytelling . Overall though it 's a giant jumble in a dire need of a proficient editor.Anyway there are many things one can talk about concerning this book and it 's hard to choose between them . Space on the Amazon is rather short and one should avoid technicalities and ramblings . I 've yet to learn how to avoid latter . Let 's try to think about facts we have at hand . A dance with dragons is 5th book in a series of seven . That means 71 % of the Saga is completed . By the way I wo n't be putting spoiler tags so tread carefully . So then what is yet to happen ? Eventually Danny has to return to Westeros and conquer some towns . Preferably the one with Iron Throne in it . Of course there are Others and impounding battle between forces of Ice and Fire . This is bound to have a lasting impact on an entire universe . Arya has to grow up eventually return to Westeros as well and do some avenging . Spider and Littlefinger have to hatch whatever plot they 're hatching and so on . There are a number of open storythreads that need to be closed.Average number of pages per book up to this point is around 850 . A dance with dragons alone has 1056 . That is almost 25 % more than average . So we have the longest book yet in which several things happen . Many severals in fact . Most of them are people eating and parading around . There are bits of this and that scattered around as well . What is important to note is this . In this book Danny had to assert control on Meereen a single town Stannis had to rally support of North by conquering a single town Jon had to build up his defenses Victarion had to sail across the sea and the other Targaryen had to be pulled out of the ass to further disintegrate the plot . Thousand pages later nothing of this actually happened . Danny is no longer in Meereen dragons magically grew up despite the fact that in some earlier book someone mentioned that this would require years but battle there is far from over . Stannis got stuck in a snow storm beneath the walls of Winterfell . Arya had two chapters in which she did some killing but essentially run around in circles . Varys appeared oh how conveniently out of the blue to kill Kevan Lannister because he can . Victarion just barely made it to the other shore and Jon was stuck on the wall and ended up repeatedly stabbed . Oh and Bran met some nice tree and had a little chat with him . Basically in 1056 pages key characters moved few miles accomplishing meager things . It sort of reminds me of some conservative chess openings that I 've seen people do just to irritate their opponents.Remember what is yet to happen ? Remember that there are only two books left ? What can we conclude from known facts ? There are several options . If pace remains the same upcoming books will be 4k+ pages mammoths with people running around avoiding to do things . If average page count remains the same we can expect the pace becoming lightning quick with people teleporting around doing things they should 've been doing all this time . Or we can expect that seventh book wo n't be the final one . In any of these cases when one has in mind the speed of Martin 's writing andor publishing of these books we can assume that we will never see the ending of these series . If we actually do it will be far from satisfying.Martin needs an Editor . Martin needs and Editor which will beat him with a stick whenever he sees him writing another paragraph on honeyed locusts roasted dogs kidney puddings and Coat of Arms of some minor lordling with a complete history of his minor House . What we need is n't another Wheel of Time . What we got with this book is something just like that A giant filler full of random ramblings Pretty Pig and the whole Tyrion story arc seriously ? that make you wonder why are you still reading this book and why will you read the next one when it comes out in a couple of years . I still do n't know the answer to this . ",2
"Gypped and hoodwinked again ! After the first three imaginative actionpacked volumes the last two have been pathetically painful . I was hoping Martin had taken some advice from his fans after the disaster that was A Feast for Crows . Apparently not . Obviously Martin is going for the stretching out the series with filler trash a la Robert Jordan showmethemoney angle and abandoning all pretense of imagination decent writing and character development . Why do these series have to go on and on if there 's nothing worth reading ? Amping up the soft porn and vulgar language is the only nod to action anywhere in this book maybe a boon to all the lonely nerds camped out in their parents ' basements but not to me.Too many characters discussing nothing endless repetition of themes yes we know Daenerys is unsure young and horny . WHERE ARE THE DRAGONS ? ? ? Yes we know Theron has broken teeth and missing fingers and Ramsay is a sadistic monster . WHEN IS THE REVENGE ? ? ? Yes we know Jon Snow is young unsure and being challenged at every turn . WHEN DOES HE TAKE CHARGE ? ? ? Lord Manderly is slovenly the Lannisters are cruel Tyrion is the misunderstood Imp etc etc It takes 500+ pages for anything to happen and it did n't tie up all the unraveling threads of endless characters no one cares about . Creating new characters is no substitute for a good story.Boring boring boring . A shameful sputtering end to a promising beginning . ",0
"So far I have n't really found one book any better than the others it 's basically just one fantastic series.This is the first series where I did n't know from the beginning what was going to happen . ",4

"Strange things have happened with the reviews of this book . I 've read through 250 reviews sorted by ` most helpful ' . Overall numbers of 45 reviews and 12s are almost equal but the vast majority of the top 250 are 12s . Clearly the 12 reviewers the antifans are more diligent in approving each others ' reviews.And there are odd similarities between many of the antifan reviews . An inability to spell the word too keeps cropping up . Perhaps it 's just a coincidence that so many fans share a common illiteracy . Or sockpupptry . Edit added on 12 April people have commented that this paragraph is offensive . It was n't intended a to offend anyone or b to imply that people who vote 12 are in any way less intelligent or literate than those who vote 45 . Rather it was intended as evidence that there is a group no doubt a small one of people using multiple usernames to alter the overall rating . I apologise to anyone who contrary to my intentions was in fact offended.Be that as it may the antifans are certainly dedicated . And incandescent with rage . A common theme is that Sword of Storms should have been the end of the introduction of new characters . Feast for Crows Dance with Dragons and any subsequent books should according to this view be confined to the outworking of the relationship between the characters already introduced . No more characters are needed say the antifans nor do we need to bother to explore any other places on the map.But the hardest to swallow of the antifan contentions is that nothing happens in Dance with Dragons . So let 's turn to the book and consider this.First Daenerys . She spends the book demonstrating her complete unfitness to rule . She had already left Astapor and Yunkai in chaos her attempts to smash slavery and bring peace complete failures . Now with time to spend in Meereen and despite her best intention she comprehensively fails again . The economy of Slaver 's Bay has been destroyed not that a slave economy deserves to be preserved its cities set at war its people decimated by pestilence and bloodshed . This is not ` nothing hapenning'.Though nothing will persuade the antifans nor it must be said many of the more misguided characters in the series of her lack of ability to rule . There is no reason at all to expect that Dany could do any better in Westeros a continent she has barely even visited than Slaver 's Bay yet she continues to command eternal loyalty . I predict her fans are in for a disappointment.Then Jon . By accepting the wildlings through the Wall he has completely transformed the economy and politics of the North . The free folk will not accept the feudal structure of the Seven Kingdoms . The ultimate outcome in Westeros will be very different as a result of their presence . Suddenly Westeros looks a bit less like medieval England and a bit more like the New World with Americanstyle democracy about to take foot.This is Jon 's major contribution and we might have to accept that Martin is going to keep writing about conflicts between people . I 'm not at all convinced there will be any ultimate showdown between dragons and Others . Yes the dragons may become controllable if Victorion ever learns to use his Horn of Dragon Control . More likely the Horn will prove to be as useless a distraction as Mance Rayner 's Horn and the dragons will turn out to be a onceinvincible weapon that can no longer be used like Greek Fire in our world . And the Others may remain more potent as an inchoate threat . Like Saddam 's weapons of mass destruction.So Jon has played his part and I ca n't regret his death too much . Though it 's pretty clear he managed to warg into Ghost at the end . The point of the Prologue about Varamyr Sixskins was surely to explain to us just how this would be done.Then there 's Tyrion . I must admit I 'm not entirely sure where his character is going . I read an article about Peter Dinklage recently which reported him as saying he had n't read the whole series and just read each script as it came . I doubt that he 's going to like being asked to ride a pig . But the device of Tyrion being sent on a journey to show us the countryside is hardly new . He began Game of Thrones by travelling up to the Wall for little purpose except to show us what it was like . And his capture by Catelyn Stark and imprisonment by Lisa Arryn neither of which revealed the cunning and skill in manipulating events for which he is so renowned seemed to serve little purpose other than show us what they Eyrie was like . So I struggle to see why the antifans are so enraged by a repetition of the device in Dance with Dragons.Perhaps Tyrion does n't do everything I 'd like to see him do in this book . But hey if I only wanted to read a book where the characters only did what I wanted them to do I 'd write it myself.The antifans are disappointed by Quentyn . Why ? Again a lot happens with him in this book . He completes a story from Dorne to take ship at Volantis to the sellswords to die releasing the dragons a key step in the unfolding disaster in Meereen . The antifans loved Ned Stark 's unexpected death in Game of Thrones and they loved Robb Stark throwing away his life for a stupid marriage triggering the Red Wedding . So why do they hate Quentyn 's death in the interest of freeing the dragons ? Yes Ned was a true and brave man of principle . Robb was well not quite Ned and perhaps not very bright to rush into a marriage with the first girl who would sleep with him but nevertheless a stirring young leader . Quentyn is even less inspirational . But I think that 's deliberate . The heroes are declining in quality.At the same time the villains are increasing in decadence . Tywin Lannister was cruel but strong and with some justification that what he did was in the interest of the kingdom . Whereas Ramsay Bolton is just vile.And these trends match the declining condition of the land as we saw in Feast for Crows with formerly fertile fields laid waste and villages damaged and emptied by war.It 's a coherent and striking picture of a world in decay.Where is this going ? Must we look to the broken ReekTheon to save Westeros ? Maybe though somehow I doubt it.I do n't think Dany will be the saviour of the kingdoms . As I 've said above she simply is not a credible ruler and the wild folk will be the factor that triggers a groundswell of objection in Westeros to accept a Targaryen whose words are ` Fire and Blood ' and whose modus operandi is to burn their enemies to death and never mind the collateral damage merely because her ancestors once ruled.Aegon is a possibility but I think he 'll crash and burn like other hopefuls Robb and Quentyn before him.The answer may be a character we 've yet to meet and who is a favourite of the free folk . Or we may finish with a recapitulation of the Doom of Valyria and discover that seasons are not the only things that can outlast their welcome in this world as in the ending of Asimov 's ` Nightfall ' ` The long night had come again'.Or we might have to accept that the book series will never be finished and instead the TV series will overtake it departing from the books at some point . In that case we 'll need a conclusion that fits the conventions of American filmmaking . This will require a happy ending with triumph by a strong and good hero . It ca n't be Daenerys or any other Targaryen too feudal and neither democratic nor meritocratic enough for an American audience . Dynasties play well in America but only if they do n't go on too long for example the Kennedys or the Bushes or Clintons . So that means a Baratheon would be perfect . I would put my money on Edric Storm . ",4
"Just like a fish I was hooked with the first three books and now I 'm writhing in pain just trying to get away . The last two parts including A Dance With Dragons have failed to capture my imagination like the series originally did . The books have morphed into the Oregon Trail game . It just feels like Martin is walking in circles to nowhere moving in slow motion gradually killing off every core character in the process . Unfortunately just like thousands or perhaps millions of others I 'll still probably purchase the final books just so I do n't feel like I 've completely wasted my time reading the others . I fear by the end though just like all of Martin 's characters I will have died of dysentery . ",1
"Like the previous 4 books in the Ice and Fire stories George RR Martin continues to captivate me with this incredible ensemble of characters and their multiple layers of stories that all play together in some form or another.Minor SpoilersBut just like A Feast Of Crows A Dance With Dragons suffers from the problem of not a lot happening . Both books build up a lot and resolve nothing . Instead leaving its fans frustrated with a series of cliffhangers and unanswered questions . In Dance the story slowly builds up to two major battles in the story and after reading page 1000 you realize that Martin has no intention to actually deliver the battles in this book instead making you wait until the next book to find out what happened . Like Feast this book appears to be about putting all of the characters in place for Martin 's end game whatever that is.Other than the prologue and epilogue this story features 16 different POV characters though the bulk of the chapters come from Jon Snow Daenerys Targaryen and Tyrion Lannister . I 've always liked reading these characters chapters and Jon Snow continue continues to be one of the best characters in the books in my opinion but the other two character 's chapters became a bit tiresome after awhile especially Dany's.Tyrion 's entire arc seems to be about him running into different groups and people along the way finding out their plans and abandoning him or getting captured by another group until he gets where he wants to be . Dany 's is in Meereen and there is no end in sight and instead of her coming to Westeros Westeros is coming to her with several POV characters attempting to narrow sea to meet her though the big players do n't actually complete the trip in this book.Jon 's still on the wall and he 's trying to tow the political line between doing what 's right for the Watch and the realm and keeping his alliance with Stannis Baratheon who is still looking to raise an army and do what he feels is necessary to protect the realm . The interaction between these two characters are some of my favorite moments of the book probably because they are my two favorite characters . Jon begins to look for help in places he would least suspect in order to help the Night 's Watch prepare for the inevitable attack of the Others as a new threat emerges from a place Lord Snow least expected.Another pleasant surprise POV was that of Reek aka Theon Greyjoy . Last we read he had been taken prisoner from the Bolton 's and was being tortured . When we find Theon he has been completely broken by the torture of Roose Bolton 's sadistic son Ramsay . Gone is the overconfident smagger and all that 's left is a meek little man who lives as the family dog and follows Ramsay 's every order in complete fear . Reek refuses to allow himself to think about who he used to be but Theon has still got to in there somewhere right ? After the evils he 's committed there 's nothing left for Theon at this point except salvation of his soul.Again I think the book is great . Its another incredible chapter in the Ice and Fire series but do n't go into this expecting any major revelations or resolutions . Its a set up book to get the characters in place for the next one .

"It looks like a lot of others did n't like this or the fourth book . I did . I read all five in the last 8 or so months with a few breaks where I read 6 or so other books . Always loved getting back to these . Took a while to get into the fourth with new characters but after I did I had a hard time stopping . Huge let down at the end of this one knowing I am going to have to wait a long time before I get another fix . But I guess I 'll watch the HBO series in the meantime . Hope the old man does n't die before he finishes the series . Just wanted to submit the review to counterbalance the haters . ",4
"I have read all 5 books and find them to have a rediculous plot there are too many villains . It lacks a believable plot line or redeemig value . Some of the characters are interesting but most of the plot twists are rediculous . ",1
"Nothing happens and those things that do happen just piss you off the book go no where and once you hit the last 5 chapters you want to throw it out the window becuase of what happens to a certain characterI loved all the other books this one just dragged its feet and dissapoints severally.Not sure if I even want to purchase the last 2 in the series when they appear in 2035~ only took what 5 years for this one.rant ",0
"George R. R. Martin is a brilliant writer and he proves it here again . The problem is he has turned into a terrible storyteller . He does very little in ADWD to move the plot of the previous novels forward . I 've highlighted a few of the many problems with the book below . Spoilers are ahead so read at your own riskWhy is Dany in Meereen for the whole book ? What does this accomplish ? Her character essentially resets at the end by meeting a khalasar on the Dothraki sea but this time she can control a dragon . Did we really need hundreds of pages of her pining over Daario and worrying about her children that we do n't care about at all ? Get to Westeros already woman ! Tyrion embracing his dwarfish ways but doing relatively little throughout the book . I always enjoyed the Tyrion chapters but they were extremely unsatisfying this time around . The only ones that were any good did not have to do with him but with the introduction of Griff and Aegon.The cliffhanger with Jon Snow that really seems laid on a little too think to be believable . And yet we still do n't know about his parentage.Jaime having one chapter that ended in a completely unsatisfying way.Quentyn Martell 's storyline bursting literally into flames no point at all to the whole subplot.Davos going off to find Rickon ? Why ? Rickon did n't ever factor into the books before why should we care what happens to him ? Bran can look through treesreally ? That 's his power ? SighBran somehow needs to be integrated into the proper plot of the books . So far he is just there being Bran.I really could keep going on and on about the deficits of this book . Granted there were some good things that happened . I enjoyed Theon 's and Barristan 's chapters since they are great characters though I miss Theon now that he 's Reek . Also the addition of Aegon and Jon Connington shook things up immensely . Finally a Targaryen is in Westeros ! though not the one I expected.Basically this just seemed like endless setup with very little that actually happened . I do n't know if Martin has become paralyzed with his popularity unable to appease both his fanbase and his editors what editing they do is beyond me or maybe he just does n't know where his story is ultimately going.The Winds of Winter has been setup with 2 novels now over the course of 11 years . If Martin can not deliver after spending 2000 pages setting the stage then he needs to relinquish his purported best living fantasy writer crown.I hope it does n't disappoint . This one however did .

"' A Dance with Dragons ' is the fifth novel in George R.R . Martin 's A Song of Ice and Fire series . I have n't included any spoilers about 'Dance ' in this review but it is impossible to discuss the book without revealing events from the first four . So if you have n't readA Game of Thrones A Song of Ice and Fire Book 11996 and its sequels go ahead and get yourself caught up . I 'll wait.Okay now that we 're all on the same page literally you 're probably a little unsatisfied byA Feast for Crows A Song of Ice and Fire Book 42005 . After all as Martin writes in the afterword Wait a minute wait a minute ! Where 's Dany and the dragons ? Where 's Tyrion ? We hardly saw Jon Snow . That ca n't be all of it Fortunately that is correct . The story Martin set out to tell in 'Feast ' was too big to fit in just one book so he divided it into two . 'Dance ' tells the rest of the story although like all of the other books in the series it ends with more loose ends than knots.In 'Dance ' the game of thrones is far from over and it has become clear that the game is not worth winning though losing is much worse . Only one of the original claimants in the War of Five Kings still lives but new contenders keep popping up . The fight for control of Westeros has become a world war with new fronts opening up north of the Wall and across the Narrow Sea.Martin 's great strength is his ability to flesh out all of his characters by regularly shifting point of view . Cersei Lannister in particular begins the saga as a calculating ice queen but is startlingly human in 'Feast ' and 'Dance . ' Like the real world Westeros contains no heroes or villains just people whose mistakes cause unintended suffering.This review originally appeared in Pop Mythology.Matt HlinakAuthor ofDoG ",2
"Story is dragging at this point . I think this was a big improvement over book 4 but so little happens compared to the first 3 books . So much of what does happens seems to be told secondhand . Honestly I think the show will be better . ",3
"I liked the book and it is significantly better than most in this genre but it leaves a lot to be desired . Basically this is a book that is building up to another book but has no climax of it 's own . Nothing is resolved and basically you feel that the plot of the entire novel has been left to drift down a river like Twyin . This feels a lot like books 711 of the Wheel of Time series meaning that you just want something anything to get resolved for a damn change . ",3
"George R. R. Martin & # 8217s A Dance with Dragons manages to do what its less exciting twin A Feast for Crows couldn & # 8217t reignite my love for the A Song of Ice and Fire series.Events are more exciting than those of A Feast of Crows and Martin drops more than a few pageturning cliffhangers throughout the book as he builds the grand narrative back up to another climactic peak . But it & # 8217s a ponderous buildup at times with disappointingly empty chapters and sideplots and supporting characters that seem to veer nowhere.The book has a better pedigree than its predecessor . It & # 8217s filled with Martin & # 8217s best and most beloved characters in Tyrion Lannister Jon Snow Arya Stark and Daenerys Targaryen . Martin throws into that mix some familiar faces like Theon & # 8220Reek & # 8221 Greyjoy who & # 8217s misery may top all of Westeros which is saying much . And one of my favorites Davos Seaworth appears early only to disappear for the remainder of the book in a puzzling absence.For most of these favorites things happen . Jon Snow deals with the hard and sharp ! realities of being a leader of the Night & # 8217s Watch . Arya earns her mysterious stripes . Tyrion travels vast distances and sees many thing . But Daenerys & # 8212 ah Daenerys is the trouble . Really it & # 8217s her book and her transformation . But like Cersei Lannister & # 8217s chapters in A Feast for Crows her chapters plod on one after another of offstage events as she struggles to be queen . Her transformation is glorious but getting there is a slog.Then there are the new bloods & # 8212 perspective characters like Quentyn Martell Victarion Greyjoy and Jon Connington . Martin seems to be playing with these new voices and events . His success wavers . Quentyn Martell feels superfluous even irrelevant . Victarion more so though he seems to have something major in store for Daenerys.Given the death and destruction Martin inflicts on his characters especially to the Stark family there must be room for new voices like these . But several thousand pages in is Martin & # 8217s exploring a vast wondrously dangerous playground or weaving one of the grandest fantasy narratives ever written ? That question keeps me interested but a little disappointed when these detours end abruptly . They drive home painfully his themes about ruthlessness and ambition of fickle fates and violence but test our trust that there is anything here worth rooting for worth investing in.Still with A Dance with Dragons there is a sense that Martin is that good that all my fellow readers and I suffering for our favorite characters will see some pay off some day and we & # 8217ll earn a grand and satisfying ending .

"People tend to not give a feast for crows and a dance with dragons enough credit . Granted a storm of swords was the best and my personal favorite in the series but these books are great in their own right . A dance with dragons was more a set up for the coming winds of winter and a must read for a song of ice and fire fan . ",4
"Is no one safe ? The conclusion will have to be made of all new cast members . Ca n't wait to read it ! ",4
"I have now read the first five books in the Song of Fire and Ice and this fifth book has grown upon me during the second reading . Although it leaves the reader with more questions than it answersand so many cliffhangers that we are left slavering for the next volumethis book also provides a rich tapestry of events for the reader . Some of our favorite characters are still alive while bad things happen to some good peoplebut I will provide no spoilers ! For Martin fans another great read . ",4
"Overall I enjoyed reading it but with some serious misgivings about the book.I 'd say the biggest flaw in the book is the sheer number of characters . There are just too many characters I do n't like . And by do n't like I mean I find them boring not that I do n't like the way they act or their personality . Plus Martin spends too many pages just describing scenery and what kind of clothing people are wearing . Too much of the book feels like padding only there to fill in some pages.The series itself has now become so long and the story so complex that even though I 've read every book in the series I 've lost track of who some of the characters are . Some chapters feature characters that I have no idea who they are or what they 're doing.Nothing gets resolved in this book . No major plotlines have come to a conclusion . We still do n't know who the Others are or why the dead are coming back to life . And that was a plot point featured in the prologue of the very first book ! The whole book just feels like a swimmer treading water just keeping his head above the ocean and not going anywhere.To sum it upSome very good and interesting characters and stories in the book . But there are just too many boring patches and too many characters I do n't care about.I wish this book had been the final book in the series . Not just because I do n't want to wait another 5 years for the next book but because the series itself is becoming so long and complicated . If the next book comes out in a year or two I 'll probably get it . But if it takes longer than that forget it.I give it a 3 stars out of 5 rating . ",2
"This book should have been called A Dance With Nothing . Because Nothing is exactly what happens . The author flatout admits in the forward that this book is nothing but clippings from the cutting floor of the last book . And man does it show . I ca n't actually give you spoilers because there are n't any . And most ironically ? The dragons are n't even in the book except for maybe four pages ! Here 's a summary the action in book 548 pages of random conversation that does n't relate to anything.One sentence description of somebody getting killed.^^ repeat about 20 times.Seriously there 's a chapter called Dude on a Horse.The magic has really gone out of this series for me . I hope the next book is a million times better than this ! ",0
"The saga continues in A Dance With Dragons . This is not a book that is for a light reader you have to take your time to absorb everything going on . Once I started I could not put down . ",4
"I have mixed feelings about this book . Lots of good stuff goes on and as usual GRRM creates vivid descriptions . However in this book there was so much going on so I felt that the story with Daenery 's longlost nephew was really unnecessary . There is already a lot of stories going on at the Wall in Dorne at King 's Landing in Meereen etc etc that to have this extra story jammed in is just overkill.I found the premise of him being 'saved ' and another baby put in his place to be hard to believe as this would imply that Varys knew Elia would die . Honestly this book was already so thick that cutting out the entire Aegon storyline would have benefited.Nonetheless I am still eager for the sixth book of this series especially with the cliffhanger ending we got for several of the characters and hope that Winds of Winter will come out soon !

"I feel like most of the reviews sum up my thoughts quite well but here is my two cents . This series started off as an original intricate and engaging story . Unfortunately after the first few books the story has come to a virtual standstill . I find that this book is like climbing a mountain you can take the straight route to the top which may bypass a few sights but gets you there quick or you can switchback your way up and take your time . I feel like Martin has switchbacked doubled back stopped for lunch and then decided to go back down and try the other side of the mountain . The characters are still engaging but after the twentieth kidnapping I as a reader started to get a little restless . Danaerys has been in the desert for so long I am becoming bored with who used to be my favorite character . Cersei is predictable in her actions by this point and I really could n't care less about all the drama happening at the Iron Throne . I am hopeful that Martin will pick up the pace and reunite all of our beloved characters in an epic battle an overseas war..heck at this point I 'd settle for a drunken feast . At this rate I feel like Bran will live out his days as a tree Tyrion will ride off on a pig into the sunset and Danaerys will get swallowed by a sandstorm.I wish I could be as drawn in to this book as I was for the first few . But it was a struggle to finish to be honest . Here 's hoping Mr. Martin picks up the pace with the next few books.Thats my opinion of it . You do n't have to agree and I hope you liked it more than I did but unfortunately I found it to be a let down . ",2
"I truly did enjoy this book . I agree with other reviewers in saying that not much new stuff happens but it was still a good read . I hope his next book provides more meat less potatoes . ",3
"Good lords compared to all other books this one is the one that took me longer to read . While I do like pretty much all the characters in the series my favorite ones showed up more frequently in A Feast for Crows so the reading of A Dance With Dragons was awfully dragged back . Absolutely NOTHING seemed to happen until near the end of the book and compared to the previous books even the occurrences of the end of the book do n't really seem as shocking as the end of A Storm of Swords and A Feast for Crows . For several pages it felt like the author was just filling the pages with trifle things specially banquet descriptions . Seriously whenever I read any chapter that has banquets in it it feels like he wrote that when he was absolutely starving . In a way it 's good it helps you to picture the whole scenario quite better . But after this has been going on for over a thousand pages it starts getting very tiring.Nevertheless I never felt so glad to finish reading a book . I 'm finally free from heavy spoilers for another while . ",3
"I am as obsessed with GEORGE R R MARTIN 'S as I was with Steven King back in the 70 's and 80 's . I am so absorbed with all his books I go back and read passages in his other books in the series . Of all his characters . I like the DRAGONS best . No I really love them . So I currently am downloading all of Martin 's . Books . DRAGONS was a FIVE all the way . ",4
"Time Magazine needs to take back their statement that GRRM is the American Tolkien . Tolkien was never this tedious not even in the Silmarillion which sorely tested my patience . Hell I 'd take a book of JRR 's lengthy elvish ballads over this dreck any day of the week.I lost patience with this series 2 books ago but I felt revitalized after watching the superlative HBO series this spring . I think that made things worse actually since Peter Dinklage was so amazing as Tyrion and in this book Tyrion is reduced to drivel.Other reviewers have covered the many problems with this book already so I wo n't rehash . I will say that it is now clear to even the most devoted GRRM fans that he has gotten to full of himself to write a decent book anymore . He believes his own press and as a result has become a pretentious windbag who needs a swift kick in the pants and a fascist editor who will slash his work to the bone . ",0

"Wonderfully written . I am only 20 % Kindle of the way through but am enjoying this book immensely . Beautifully written and I will hate when it ends . I realize that the neverending storyline drives people crazy but the real horror is when the last page of the last book is turned and there is nothing left to expect ever . Get the book enjoy the ride and read as it is a wonderful literary trip . Read the series again if you are frustrated with the publishing schedule . Just love great writing and the turtle description was great . ",4
"I tried to like this edition of the story but unfortunately there were few chapters that captured my imagination . Wordy descriptive little action . I know it 's mid story but I have no interest in all the courses of a meal . On top of that I think GRRM has pretty much knocked off the most interesting people and fails to create new ones who capture you . ",1
"Well it 's out much to the relief of many fans around the world . The big question is whether or not it was worth the wait . The answer sadly is maybe.Thankfully George R.R . Martin continues to write in an entertaining and effective manner . The book retained my interest throughout and there are a lot of books these days that don't.Unfortunately what the book fails to do is advance the plot of the series in anything resembling a timely matter . Do big events occur ? A couple very late in the book but most of the book deals with characters waiting and waiting and waiting some more . Or travelling towards a destination that they just ca n't reach . Tyrion remains the luckiest character in the series as well as the most entertaining for any other character would likely be dead if he 'd gone through everything the dwarf went through.The book also advances if you 'd call it that the ongoing story of the dragon queen Dany . Much of the book concerns her thrashing around and making bad decisions whilst other relatively major characters try to meet her and mostly fail to do so . As an exercise in the continued frustration of the goals of the characters this book really comes up trumps.If I were to compare this book and Feast of Crows to anything it would be Robert Jordan 's Crossroads of Twilight where he attempted something different and then realised it was a mistake . Unfortunately it is much more of a structural flaw with the Song of Ice and Fire books that I ca n't see Martin getting out of easily Too many POVs not enough advancement of the story . And given that it 's taken 10 years to write what is in essence one big book which does n't do enough my hopes of a speedy resolution to the series are fading.This is not to say that nothing happens Jon Snow gets to build up the Night Watch and the wildlings Dany gets some dragon time and Stannis gets caught in a blizzard . Oh wait that last is nothing happening Melisandre also becomes a lot more fallible and a lot more human . If you believe that she 's interpreted any of her prophecies correctly by the end of the book you 're a kinder person than me.Originally Martin intended the fourth book of the series to take place five years after the third . He changed his plans and ended up writing two books A Feast of Crows and this book to bridge the gap . We might have gotten one year out of the two books I doubt any more . So what next for the series ? George R.R . Martin can still write well but the pace will need to pick up greatly in the next two books to return the Song of Ice and Fire to the heights it once aspired to . ",2
"If you love these books you have to read this fifth book . If you 've never read these before then do n't read this one first . If you are debating on whether to buy this one after reading the others in quick succession I would suggest taking a break and returning to the series as I get a little bored with it when I read back to back ",4
"The down load to my Kindle was so simple and I still have it so I can refer to it anytime . I loved the book but now of course like everyone else I have to wait for the next one ! Torture ! ! ! ! Anyway Amazon has become my go to book buying for hardbacks paper or Kindle versions their 1 Click option is the best option EVER ! ! Merry K . ",4
"Halfway through and I can go on no longer . Nothing has happened and judging from other reviews nothing continues to happen . The breaking point for me was one too many pages of useless whining from some female dwarf that Tyrion meets yes another throwaway minor character that GRRM seems strangely fascinated by . Sadly I do n't share his fascination and no longer care about this series which has degenerated into a strange combination of travelogue torture porn and food criticism . ",0
"Stephen King once talked about a book getting away from the author it happens when a character takes on a life of his own and the author starts feeling compelled to bring the whole family and all his friends and acquaintances into the plot . And then for each of the new characters he weaves stories about their family and friends too . So you end up with a book about Our Hero and the lives of his mother father six sisters two brothers all of his brothers and sistersinlaw everybody 's school friends employers teachers cousins nieces and nephews and the butcher the baker and the candle stick maker . The reader gets lost in a morass of plots and sub plots dozens of characters and sometimes totally unrelated story lines that lead nowhere . This is what happened in this book . The first three books of the Throne series were very good but the cast started to really get out of control in book four . A Dance with Dragons feels like Martin realized this and has tried to tie up all the loose ends but only ends up muddying the waters even more . People keep dying and then not being dead anymore . Some of the cast from the first two or three books have totally disappeared and nobody has a clue what has happened to them and the time lines are so confusing that you start reading a chapter and say to yourself but I thought he was hiding in a cave how come he is safe in a castle ? only to find out a few pages later that the story has now gone back before the person had left the castle to find the cave . The writing is fine . The story line is a mess . ",2
"I will only say that I do n't think that his geographic splitting of this book works . Neither does introducing Quentyn of Dorne . Not my favorite but I am dedicated to seeing this through to the end.My least favorite part was the lack of political intrigue . Dany used to be on of my favorite characters but she has begun to be portrayed as weak in my opinion.I always love the Arya chapters . Same goes for Jamie 's and Cersie 's . But I do think that the Jamie chapters except for the last page of his were not needed . I am glad he wont introduce any new point of view characters . I began to lose track.So now we must all wait 47 years for the next one . ",2
"I have never done this before this book but I have skipped large numbers of pages looking for a story . All I read are inane details like George R.R . Martin just likes the sound of his own voice or the appearance of his own writing I should say . The fact that it has taken two separate books in order to address all of the characters over a fairly short period of time where almost nothing happens means that Martin needs a new editor at the least . Someone needs to cut his books in half or more . Someone needs to cut away the unnecessary description because it is n't like his descriptions are poetic or great literature . I give up . I have tried and tried to get through the last three Martin books in this series but I give up . I am not going to waste any more time . ",1
"This book has about onefifth the story line even of book 4 and instead fills the pages with excruciatingly detailed descriptions of the bloody flux greyscale bad weather and maggoty food . NOT what one would expect from the author being touted as the American Tolkein.It 's utterly unsatisfying to the point where I am dumping it and the other 4 books at the local library.If you feel compelled to read it just to find out how bad it is for yourself at least do n't spend any money on it . Go get it at the library . You 'll feel slightly less ripped off that way ",0
"More of the same awsome story with even more complicated characters and incomplete cliff hangers and head scratching moments . But after all that.is it worth reading if its going to take 4 years from the time this book was written to the time book 6 comes out ? AND another 4 to 5 years before book 7 . Me personally will have to reread before getting the next one as these stories are so complicated i will have forgotten most of the details . If you havent started the series i would say waitif you have well then get your fix and wait like the rest of us hungry suffering dogs . ",3
"There are a lot of characters in this book and the last . Sometimes i get a little confused but overall I 've loved the series and I ca n't wait for the next book . ",4
"I ca n't put this book down . It 's extremely captivating . Better than Clash of Titans . It 's off to a slow start at first but then gets much much better . ",4
"While the entire series has been great the 4th book was a little disappointing . No one cares about Sam or ever will so constantly talking about his depressing existence without at least breaking it up with some action was an unfortunate choice . This book however takes advantage of the slightly boring development that occurred in book 4 and covers all the interesting characters that were effectively left out of the last book . It occurs concurrently with book 4 and the tieins help character and story development immensely . ",4
"Wow that 's a pretty even spread of reviews is n't it ? While the sales I 'm sure are enough to make the publisher happy it 's clear from looking at reviews of the first three books compared to the last two that things have changed slightly . Any negative reviews early on tended to focus on how graphically violent the series could be nowadays readers are almost praying for violence just to make something happen . Some folks are starting to throw around the Robert Jordan comparisons which is a bit of a low shot but it shows how the attitudes have shifted slightly . Two books ago this series could do no wrong . Times have sure changed and some degree of disillusionment has been going on . What the heck happened ? People have come into this series with a great deal of high expectations a lot of it fairly warranted . By most accounts and while this is by no means a consensus the first three books in the series are really really awesome . They were a fantastic mix of fantasy and sheer operatic grit operating in a world where the rules were n't much different than here even if the stakes were higher . Wedded to a fascinating back story and given a huge cast of characters who were torn between scheming to get on top and sheer survival you had a whole confluence of events that were clearly racing toward a conclusion that was n't going to be pretty but was going to be worth the ride . Then Martin had to split up the fourth novel into two parts the second of which is this novel as well as parts of the next one even as the books themselves got longer and the gaps between them became longer as well . What had been taking only two years in between books was now taking up to five and while four years got us three books it 's taken a decade to get two more . None of that should matter if the novels are good though right ? It 's the ultimate quality that is the deciding factor right ? Unfortunately by lengthening the gestation process for each book he 's only raising expectations higher . We 're wired that way go figure . While we still expect greatness because we 're unfair and unforgiving that way by putting five years in between each book it 's almost implicitly promising that it 's going to be mindblowing and completely worth the wait . And is that what we get here ? Not quite . So what 's happened ? Or what is happening ? As it says on the package this book picks up on all the stuff that we did n't get to see in Book Four notably what everyone 's favorite dwarf Tyrion and future dragonqueen Daenerys are up to as well as a host of other characters that were involved in that part of the planet . Splitting the books up while it probably made sense from a publishing perspective has really only served to dull the momentum of the books . While the early novels were masterpieces of intensity here it feels like the pace has slackened somewhat and seems to be taking a more leisurely trot toward the bloody conclusion we all know is coming . Tyrion is a case in point . . . he 's constantly referring to events that happened at the end of the third book which for him was a very recent event . For the rest of us it was close to a decade ago and feels off for some reason . We 've been apart from these people for too long and they seem to have changed somewhat in the interim . Or maybe we have . Everyone goes through their motions and furthers their plans but it all seems somehow more . . . static.This is the big problem with the book and seems to be a fairly common complaint . It promises the awesome without actually bringing it . He had his pick of fairly interesting plotlines to work from and further . Maybe too many and that may be another reason that the novels feel somewhat blunted . With so much to work with there 's no way to keep all those balls dancing in the air without the pace suffering somewhat . He 's got a hard task in front of him . . . having set all these plots in motion and scattered them to the four winds he 's got to bring them all back so that the players are all on stage for the conclusion a task right now that probably feels like steering the Titanic . Which may explain why a good portion of this book feels like it 's treading water marking time waiting for all the elements to interlock and come together . Tyrion spends the entire book trying to get to Daenerys without really succeeding . In times past he would have met up with her before the book hit the halfway mark and livened up the scene with an alliance of scheming . Here everyone is like blind people feeling their way around the same room . Everyone is close but nobody knows it and thus they never interact . Daenerys waiting for Tyrion ca n't do much and so falls in love and kills time with courtly matters . Then does something fairly important and vanishes for what feels like hundreds of pages . Oops.The other chunk of the book is taken up by Jon Snow and his merry crew over at the Wall . The Night Watch has been waiting for winter it seems since the book started and the rumored presence of the Others has been haunting the background of events almost since the beginning . But again it feels like we 're stuck in a holding patterns with the Others just about to attack and for a thousand pages never really making an appearance . Again maybe it needs to all happen at once but until then he sort of dithers and comes to no firm decisions making preparations for stuff that is n't going to happen yet . He argues with the Watch he deals with the Wildings he argues with hardcore hopeful king Stannis and at the end of the book we 're almost where we 've begun . Well almost . And this is the other part of the problem.We get a thousand pages of everyone moving in circles and then right toward the end the awesome starts to come back as events begin to speed up again . Stannis makes a move that might go poorly Jon Snow gets a move made Daenerys puts herself in a different position and Tyrion could potentially make everyone 's life miserable which has been consistent at least . . . and then the book ends . We get all this setup with very little of the consequences and Martins leaves us on the cusp of events being about to explode . Which on some level is fine if the next book contains all these explosions then people will probably proclaim as regaining that vibe that has been missing all this time . And when the series is done and capable of being read as a piece people probably wo n't even notice how this book seems transitional . But we need explosions here now because we 're reading these novels as they come out and since we 're in some way financing the next book or two or improvements on his house or his stamp collection it hardly matters we 're at least owed some nod to the serial format . Asking for a book that operates as a complete book on its own and also as part of a larger piece is not too much to ask for especially when years go by between novels.Ultimately none of this may matter . This may indeed be a transitional piece necessary because the huge amount of plots made splitting the last book necessary . If he can follow through on what barely gets started here wrap it up in two books plausible the elements for the finale are getting into place and get them out at a reasonable pace even if his and my definitions of reasonable probably differ it will be seen as a slightly flawed masterpiece with a great beginning and end and a slightly bloated middle . That 's okay . Getting all the characters back together in the same novel is a step in the right direction . Everyone is too scattered here and that intensity that informed the early books because everyone was constantly scheming and playing off each other is missing here . We need interactions between the main host again . We need them to start plotting directly to kill each other . Everyone right now is inhabiting their own separate short story inside the novel and we need them to be part of one novel again racing toward the conclusion . It 's possible it really is.Martin 's storytelling skills are intact at no point did I want to fling this across the room . It kept me reading for a thousand pages . That 's no mean feat . Some sequences are close to fantastic all the stuff with Reek Arya 's chapters the brief glimpses of Jaime and Cersei . Tyrion remains entertaining and once Daenerys becomes a mover and shaker plus one new character who the jury is still out on things could happen rapidly . The potential is there . I care about what 's there and what 's missing . I want to know what happens with Bran with Brielle with Catelyn Tully and the Vale . I love the flashbacks we get and how Aerys and Rheagar and all the people we never saw feel like real characters even though we 've only heard about them through the voices of others how it feels like myth real people witnessed . I love how the history breaths and is constantly being made before us . I know he 's under a lot of pressure even if he 'd maybe never admit it maybe he 's not he is a professional after all . You can only hear the modern Tolkien comparisons for so long before you start to realize that people are expecting a masterpiece for the new century when all you wanted to do was tell this nifty fantasy story . But we read and we 're here and for the most part we 're sticking around until the end . So just relax and tell the story and let it unfold . It does n't need to be perfect and huge and epic and all those things that high fantasy is supposed to be just good.Ultimately this will only be seen as a blip . You 've got all the ingredients in front of you and two more books . You 've got this George . ",4
"This book like it predecessor received widely mixed reviews . There is n't the kind of grand conclusions to story lines that take place in the previous books which is disappointing to many readers . This book like A Feast for Crows occurs during a brief lull in the action and is generally setting things up for we all hope a following series of books where all hell will break loose.If you were disappointed by all of the BList characters in the previous book e.g . no Jon Bran etc . then you will be pleased to see that their stories all continue in this book.I found the book enjoyable and it makes me very eager to see what happens next . Unfortunately I am afraid that the next book wo n't be appearing for some time . ",3
"After a very long wait for Mr. Martin 's next novel I found myself forgetting most of what had occurred in the past books . I needed a refresher on the Feast of crows . The HBO series refreshed me for the beginning of his series.The bottom line I was very disappointed in Dance with Dragons . I felt like this book was simply a set up for his next novel . After hundreds of pages I found myself bored and longing for some of the action of his earlier works.Way too much detail I do n't get the extensive details of characters that are not interesting and do n't seem to be major players in the plot . I had nothing to hang this information on and the archaic names made it even more burdensome to try.Masochism The author seemed to dwell on certain characters getting above and beyond their share of abuse . After a book full of Reek being verbally physically emotionallyabused I grew weary and disinterested . It seemed to me that the author could have conveyed this in fewer much fewer pages . We get the picture.Dragon Queen This is not the same Queen we knew in earlier works . She is stuck in nowhere 's ville and out of touch with her dragons . In keeping with the title this book would have been a chance for the author to make the dragons center stage and really bring them to life . Instead we are disconnected from them as they are left to languish in their dark basement cell.With more books to come I hope the author delivers . I am not willing to wait 5 years for the next book . I also expect some creative action and set all these characters in motion so that we get what we come to expect and deserve since we have stuck with Mr. Martin through two duds . ",2
"I absolutely hated the ending of this series.So many loose endstoo many what where who'senough of them to think that there will be a # 6 but was bad enough to be greatful that there will not be . I do n't mind using my imagination to figure some of it out but closure is missing . ",1
"The plot has finally pick up steam after it seemed to slow quite a bit in Feast for Crows . The book was definitely not what I expected it to be yes I still needed to refer back to the Game of Thrones iPhone reference app to look up characters but the characters keep growing and becoming more complex to the point where maybe you can see where the story is heading . There are two great battles that are left open ended and thus I hope Winds of Winter comes sooner than later . For the Khalessi fans she definitely becomes amazing in this bookjust keep reading ! ",4
"Again I devoured this . I do n't quite understand my attraction to this series because I find a lot of it annoying for instance I ca n't stand the long drawn out travel sequences with Tyrion or with Bran and Jojen . And for other characters Martin spares us the travelogue prose entirely . I think its feudal soapoperatic quality is what keeps me coming back for me . It 's a guilty pleasure . ",4
"This book was outstanding . It kills me that we have to wait for the next two books to come out still so at George RR Martins pace that 'll be roughly 30 years . Extremely well written duh awesome plot twists and turns also duh and the next couple books will be page turners I 'm sure ! ",4
"Amazing series of books ! Incredible story line so many surprises and twists and turns . Sorry to see it endfor now ! Ca n't wait for # 6 ! ",4
"Sounds like Martin is developing a case of the Robert Jordan syndrome writing a story that will never end like one of the soap operas on afternoon tvps how do i rate ZERO stars ? ? ",0
"A Dance with Dragons is George R. R. Martin 's fifth volume in his A Song of Ice and Fire series.It has been several years since Martin published the last volume A Feast for Crows . For me the time between books made the beginning of this book a little difficult . Martin 's style of writing jumping from character to character made it hard to keep track of the characters . It was easier to remember the major characters Tyrion Jon Bran and Daenerys . But keeping track of the many minor character was difficult . And Martin uses a large cast of characters.In the first four books Martin titled each chapter with the name of the main character of that chapter . In this installment Martin titled some chapters with phrases descriptive of the chapter 's main character . This literary device challenges the reader to discern who Martin is writing about . Yet it can be somewhat confusing when the reader is dealing with a large group of characters.In his introduction A Cavil on Chronology Martin explains that the first part of this book parallels A Feast for Crows . Then halfway through the book the timelines come together and we read about some long forgotten main characters such as Cersei and Jaime.So what are the main characters up to ? Jon Snow is learning how to be the leader of the Night Watch at the wall . His halfbrother Bran Stark is north of the wall being called by some mysterious force . Arya Stark is in Braavos across the narrow sea serving as a novice in a temple . Tyrion Lannister is across the narrow sea trying to get to Daenerys Targaryen . Daenerys is learning the difference between a conquering queen and a ruling queen . She has not yet learned how to use and control her dragons . Cersei Lannister is in prison accused of treason and fornication . And Jaime Lannister is riding around Westeros settling disputes between local lords.There are many others Reek Lady Melisandre Quentyn Martel and Asha Greyjoy to name a few . And do n't forget all the dead white walkers north of the wall.I enjoyed this book . Once I got a handle on the characters the book was a joy to read . However I still have absolutely no idea who will be left alive at the end.Spoiler alert Martin has absolutely no problem killing off a character . Be prepared . ",4

"I would n't recommend these books to anyone ! They are laborious to read complex and frustrating ! The characters are interesting but the writer never fully completes their stories . I am left frustrated with a feeling of incompletion . I wish I had never started them . ",0
"Great book . Never seems to get boring and leaves you at a very dramatic and cliffhanger ending for almost all the characters . Anyone who has read previous books in the series will realize that his writing is dynamic and plot twists are some of the most dramatic in the history of the genre . ",4
"There was not enough action in this latest Game of Thrones installment . Very long and long winded book . It seems as though it is time to tie the lose ends and finish this tale . ",2
"This series just gets better and better ! I loved the new character POVs in this book.Martin is a master of creating a world that is not only fun to read but has incredible depth both in its characters and the physical world itself.I love that I have no idea how this series will end but I am certainly coming along for the ride !

"Here 's a radical suggestion what if GRRM revived the serial tradition ? A monthly deadline would be a boon to us all his doorstoppers are now both late AND disappointing.That rising howl you hear is the fan reaction to what may be charitably called cliffhangers though perhaps graceless plot interruptions would be more apt . Martin does the equivalent of chopping off A GAME OF THRONES right when Dany walks into the pyre instead of closing grandly on the morning after . I 'd recommend waiting 2 years for a library copy or waiting 10.5 years until the next installment . In terms of longterm damage the cliffhangers will force the next book to pick up the story just minutes after this one abruptly broke off . Martin used to say that he wanted a 5year gap so that the kids could grow older but I do n't see a clear path forward.In DANCE we get plentiful descriptions of history geography and nipples both color and size quite reliably but where 's the actual story ? As a disappointingly apt analogy FEASTBrienne DANCEJonDanyTyrion . SPOILERFREE Jon 's interrupted arc = > very CEOlike reminiscent of Tyrion as Hand with an illuminating POV chapter from Melisandre.Dany 's bloated arc = > a mess of fail on so many levels . You only need to read her first and last chapters the middle will only make you angry confused and inexplicably sleepy.Tyrion 's meandering line = > an unfinished fistful of novella that must have been lying around GRRM 's desk.Theon 's actual arc = > the unexpected star of the show.Other people = > a bare whisper of where Rickon is hiding 11 lines on Brienne 3 sad but beautiful Bran chapters interesting looks at Jaime and Cersei some unresolved Iron Islanders and assorted useless Dornishmen whose house words should be The sun always fails .

"Wow where to start ? Well at least I did start to read this book.The problem was it kept putting me to sleep.I did enjoy Martin 's first three books but its been a fast train wreck getting through book 4 and now 5.The author is suffering from attention span deficit . And rambles on and on about the stupidest crap . Considering his deterioration and age this series will never be finishedrectified . I wo n't be indulging in his works any longer . ",0
"The book is well written and full of action as befits the 5th book in this series . I get really ticked at not being able to get through the whole thing and having to wait for the next book to be published . Reading the book after seing the series helps you visualize the characters . I notice the differences and can not say one is better than the other over all but I tend to favor the books . I am not really happy with the Saturday morning serial cliff hanger ending in this volume . I would be buying the next volume in the series anyway . Cherryh 's Foreigner series does a much better at making each volume also stand by itself that is the one big failing of this series . ",3
"I have similar comments as many others it is still interesting reading but starting to get boring . How many times can Tyrion cheat death ? What is with Bran ? This will probably be my last purchase of the series unless the next book is a conclusion.It reminds me very much of the Dune series from several years ago in that it just started to be so dragged out that it was not enjoyable any more . Martin seems to enjoy writing certain things over and over . ",2
"GRRM is going down the same road as Robert Jordan did with the Wheel of Time series . He started off strong with excellent pacing compelling characters and a clear idea of where he wanted to go.But thensomething happened . Either he lost the thread or he decided that he was making too much money and that he needed to drag things out or a little of both . Because whereas the first three books were some of the finest modern fiction ever written these last twoaren't.Next to nothing substantial happens . There is precisely one major development towards the end . There are rumors of other interesting things happening off camera but GRRM used up too much space describing food to relate those.There 'd be plenty of cliffhangers too if I still actually cared enough about the story to fret about them and if I did n't realize it 'll be at least another 5 years before there 's any resolution.Taken on it 's own merits it 's not a bad book . Not great but not terrible either . But taken as part of the series that started with AGoT ACoK and ASoS it 's simply proof that GRRM fell with AFfC and has n't gotten back up again.And now he 's talking about how he might need 8 books instead of 7 to finish it ? At the current rate he 'll need 10 or 12 . At the current glacial pacing it 'll take at least 2 and probably 3 more books before the dragons come west and another 4 or 5 before the Others actually attack . ",2
"This is a great book . If you started watching the HBO series you really need to read the books they are great . ",4
"I waited for the promised trade paperback edition but after postponement upon postponement I went for the hard cover edition.Given the long lapses between books I find that I must begin the series anew with each new release . That usually works to refresh the plots and allows me to sink into the world of Fire & Ice picking up the threads as they appear or don't.Given the concept that this volume contains all the rest of the saga that was left out of A Feast for Crows it is hampered by the format . With the first three volumes you got the feeling that you were staying current with all of the plots . Given the way that the story has expanded this could not happen with the MegaSaga that would have resulted in trying to combine A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons . I would have preferred Mr. Martin to shorten the timeline in order to maintain the continuity . The plotline is just too complex and even though I had reread the previous 4 volumes directly before tackling this one it was a struggle . Perhaps the Winds of Winter will contract a bit as various threads are resolved . ",3
"Great read got better the further I read . Ca n't wait to begin the next one . Bound to be good too ! ",4
"Having read all the others bought this to complete the collection . It 's so dragging I read maybe a page a day then put it down . Maybe I will finish it before the next one comes out and hope that is better . Every penny cent of this purchase is wasted . Should have taken it from the library instead ",0
"This book ending made me angry . Frankly reading this Martin 's series has given more frustration than pleasure . I read 56 novels a week but I put his down and move to a different author all together knowing I 'm going to be disappointed or frustrated . Happily the HBO series is better than the books go figure . I will say Martin 's writing is very engaging his attention to detail does teleport me there as an observer but his books continuations andor endings leave me cold wondering why I bothered.M .

"The entire 'Game of Thrones ' series had been amazing ! The fifth one is just as good as the first . Could not put the book down ",4
"Oh my gosh I ca n't believe I actually finished all five of these freaking books . Like usual I do n't feel like I can really review A DANCE WITH DRAGONS . So much that happens pretty much everything would be a spoiler for somebody who has n't read the series yet or is only on the first book.As for the parts that I can review I actually had a lot of trouble with this book . I was so aggravated by the first 60 % of this book . It took me weeks to get through because it was so slow and just dragged on and on and on . I had to force myself to keep reading ! And I never felt like that with any of the other books except maybe through some little parts in A CLASH OF KINGS.But after I got through the first 60 % of the book the rest just flew by . It got super interesting and I could barely put it down . There was even one part towards the end of the book that made me almost come to tears.I 'm very excited to see where George is going to go next with these story lines . There are so many awesome possibilities running through my head . Now that I finally have the series the ones that are currently out at least finished I ca n't wait to go back and reread the books from the beginning . There are so many things that I know that I missed or did n't pick up on the first time around . ",3
"George RR Martin continues to amaze me . Several key players had their parts left up in the air . What 's going to happen next ? I ca n't wait for the next book . Write faster George ! Write faster . ",4
"Spoiler AlertIt is one thing to intermittently kill off a protagonist to keep the narrative and by extension the reader honest It is quite another to systematically kill off every sympathetic character in the series to the point the reader honestly no longer cares what happens . The latter is where I find myself at this point there is exactly one character left that I am invested in and it is a peripheral character . Every other character I have become invested in over the years is dead . I suppose I could contrive empathy for another character but why bother ? It has already exceeded fool me twice shame on me and I 'm done giving Martin the benefit of the doubt.There is simply no suitable conclusion to Jon 's story at this point . Either he really is dead and his entire arc was a superfluous waste of time or he is revived by some miracle resurrection which by now has become a cliche of the series . Furthermore the nascent ubiquity of such miracle resurrections has destroyed the atmosphere of the series by embracing the very fantasy tropes Martin once openly flouted.There was a time when a pivotal character dying added to the suspense of the series by letting you know no character was safe . By this point however the same trick has been pulled so many times as to make the reader numb to any empathy for any character . Thus does the series become an exercise in nihilism without relevance context or discourse . ",0
"Probably the worst book of this series I read them all and the story line was pretty consistent but this book rambles on and spends chapter after chapter on developing characters that do not intertwine with the first 4 books at allHave to say I had to convince myself to continuehoping that the story line would improve ! I would not suggest this as a book to read at all.Sorry George but this just is not a good quality book to read at allsorry I spent the money to purchase this one . ",1
"I fear Game of Thrones is going to end up like the aptly named Wheel of Time series the book is a zillion pages long and Winter is STILL coming when will it arrive ? Dany still ca n't master the dragons Bran still ca n't walk Arya is still in Braavos Tyrion is still my favorite character please do n't fall in love with Penny that would be so unTyrionlikeCersei is still a shrew and Jamie just went missing ? ? ? The book follows along in more detail from other POV characters what was going on in Feast for Crows so while the story is interesting and well written the plot advanced very little . I was hoping to there would be a little sum'in sum'in going on with Jon and Dany by now but by the time they finally meet all of the Lanisters will have died from old age the realm will be a democracy.Do n't get me wrong I LOVE GRRM and the series I just do n't want to have to wait another 6 years for the next installment . I fear that the HBO series will be complete before the novels and that would just be irritating.For fans of the books I do n't have to even say this is a must read for the newly initiated if you just started with book 1 I recommend you read slowly and perhaps by the time you get to Dance With Dragons the last book will be out.Sorry GRRM I 'm not hating I 'm just anxious ",4
"I ca n't understand the low rating for this book . I was just as upset as anyone else that it took so long for this book to come out . Maybe the reviewers were taking out their frustrations for the wait by criticizing this book . Anyway on to my review . I think this is a great series and this book was right up there with the other books in the series . If you have enjoyed the series so far you will love this book . I decided not to reread the previous books . I was able to follow the storyline and remember the characters just fine . George RR Martin 's writing is superb . He gives you just the right amount of description without boring you with too much detail . Also he continues to advance the story in this book . This series is on par with the first three books ofthe wheel of time series in my opinion . I could n't put this book down . Now I 'm going to read the other reviews to try to see why others graded it so low . ",4
"A Dance With Dragons is for me the least enjoyable Song of Ice and Fire entry to date . Most of the book is dedicated to moving characters around and for setup . The final third of the book is considerably better than the preceding two thirds and is probably the saving grace for the book as a whole . There 's some more expansion in scope as well as some smaller developments on the expansions in the previous volume A Feast for Crows.Once again as with Feast for Crows Martin relies on his world and characters . Unlike Feast however where Cersei provided a counterbalance with plot development there 's much less plot going on making the narrative far more reliant on world and characters . Some of it is interesting but mostly all the characters drifting around left me bored.There 's some political intrigue but it mostly lies beneath the surface only to rear its head in the latter half of the book . There is n't a whole lot of focus on these threats nor is much indicated about them so there 's a distinct lack of tension from that.Of all the characters Jon Snow was my favourite purely because i 'm more interested in him as a character . Tyrion had some interesting character development and his sarcasm and cynicism is always a breath of fresh air but significant portions of his story are focused on the things around him . Daenerys was the least interesting of the three main perspectives . Of the others only Theon Davos and Barristan Selmy noticably stood out and they 're only here for as long as is absolutely necessary . Arya continues to be a joy . We get a bit of time with Bran mostly to see where he goes.The rest of the viewpoints are minor characters meant only to shed light on other areas of the world and developing plot arcs . We return to a few characters from the previous book briefly so the plotlines from Dance and Feast begin to sync but these cover very little ground.There are two overriding issues which put a negative tint on this book . The first is the number of cliffhangers the second the way seemingly finished characterstory arcs are unashamedly manipulated.The first point nearly every plot arc of this book divided either by setting or character ends with a cliffhanger . Given my feelings about the first two thirds of the book and how the final third shone by comparison it 's frustrating to have everything build up and lead into nothing . While the next volume Winds of Winter looks to be positively packed with plot action everything that happened in this book builds up to a climactic point which just ends with a to be continued notice.The second point by this time in the series Martin is abusing the unreliable narrator . If a character dies it 's no given that they 're staying dead or that they even died at all . Cutting off the narrative at a point where everything seems lost or showing something happening then having a conspicuous absence of the character involved can be effective if used occasionally . It 's not though it 's used several times and as a result the events themselves lose their impact because instead of having it sink in and being surprised later i 'm left wondering whether it 's really done or how things turned back from the brink . It dulls the impact . I understand that Martin is telling these chapters from a strictly subjective viewpoint but that does n't preclude an indication of finality.I 'm hoping for a short wait for the next book and some serious delivery on setup . If not the series might begin to crumble under its own weight.35 ",2
"The novels in this series have always been rather slow . I still remember plodding through The Game of Thrones wondering if it would ever get going . Luckily after I got through the first 100 or so pages it did get moving and soon I was completely engrossed . That same formula seemed to work for the other novels as well . Some setup but eventually the story moved well.Unfortunately not this book . It was all setup and it had no climax ! Nothing . Sure he through in a few quick surprises at the end to try to justify the reader 's time but after waiting 5 years and reading 959 pages all I can say is that 's it ? . I thought at least we would have had a big battle for Winterfell at the end . Nope.George R.R . Martin has clearly become addicted to character POV 's so much so that I dont think any of the main characters had more than maybe 150 pages focused on them . Given that each had their own subplot none of them was able to get any sort of momentum for their stories.Now do n't get me wrong I still enjoyed aspects of the book . I like quite a few of the characters and even Dany who I loathed early on has become more interesting for me . But I have to say another book like this and I wo n't be reading any more in this series until it is officially over . ",1
"This was a real disappointment . Although I enjoyed the 1st couple of books it was a real effort for me to get through this one . This book series has gone from a wellwritten tale with suspense in almost every chapter to a longwinded soap opera where each installment contains less real substance.In this book the same 3 storylines persist Impending threat from beyond the Wall warring for control of the Seven Kingdoms Daenerys and her dragons in the east Will she EVER come to Westeros ? Instead of bringing the story to a climaxdenouement Martin continues to drag it out . There is too much repetition and seemingly unnecessary characters or chapters . Some examples include the chapters about Quentyn Martell or Victarion Greyjoy . What real value do they have to the main story ? This same question can be asked about the chapter with Daenerys walking alone in the Dothraki sea of grass . Most of this chapter is a review of events covered in earlier books since who could remember it all after 5000 pages . The only really interesting point in this chapter was who she meets described in the last paragraph . Why did n't the author just scrap the rest and start with that scene ? ? Redundancies were also noted in the 1st half of the book which was filled with descriptions of burned out villages razed castles and mutilated bodies very dark and disturbing . How many times does the author want to describe carnage ? A good story has to deliver its climaxpoint otherwise the audience loses interest . Maybe some criticism should go to the editor who should have encouraged the author to delete such repetitions and extraneous pages . Why keep 1000 verbose pages if the story could have been better told in half that space ? One oddity was that 34 of the way through Martin scraps using character names for the titles and instead tries things like The Queen 's Hand or The Discarded Knight . Using the character names tied the book together . This arbitrary change seems to suggest that Martin has indeed lost his focus in this seriesmuch as Dany loses her purpose in Meereen . Tyrion 's escapades and wit were the book 's one saving grace.Reviews have described Martin as the next Tolkien . I initially agreed with that . Now after over 5000 pages and no end to the story in sight that comparison no longer holds true . Tolkien gave his story closure which is what made that series phenomenal we 're still waiting on Martin and getting bored.As suggested by another reviewer one wonders if rather than creating a good tale he is now writing for future royalties or TV series ? ? ",1
"As always George does not disappoint . These are my favorite books and I absolutely love to read them over and over again . My only complaint is how long it takes for the next book to come out . Other than that I own these books both in hard copy and digital format . Very entertaining ! ! ! ",4
"I have read many reviews that agree with my feelings of what is wrong with this book and state them very well . I will not go into too much detail but the flaws are lack of editing lack of story progression too many cliffhangers and too many characters . Every character almost seems to be traveling slowly somewhere but they never arrive.The book had some good stuff hidden in the dreck . Particularly the TheonReek stuff was not bad . I almost gave it two stars but really feel the book along with book 4 really drags a good series down . Also the violence level was amped way up in a series already known for its violence and it felt gratuitous rather than adding to the story . Overall it felt like the events in this book could have been summed up in one prologue chapter at the start of the next novel and would have been more satisfying of a read . Hope the next book is better . Will probably read it since I like the show and have read this far . but wo n't rush to get it . ",0
"I could not stop reading constant action gory but insightful to human nature in such a different world . Great Fantasy super and easy reading . ",4
"This book is more fast pace than the last and includes the more exciting characters in the series.If you enjoy the series then you should purchase this one . ",4
"What can I say . I 'm 1 of the millions waiting impatiently for the continuation of this story . The tv show is wonderful too . ",4
"And now the waiting begins So many lives that could be extinguished but are they truly dead ? I will have to wait and waithopefully not as long as before as I truly can not wait years for the next book . Perhaps we need to lock Ser Martin in a tower with his writings to hurry him along ? So many characters are coming together to bring this all to the final stages although he could easily keep this going for many more books . Let winter finally come ! I am waiting.. ",4
"I started reading the books after watching the HBO series . Somehow I seem to like the TV dramatization more than the books since my only complaint is the author has too many wheels spinning and takes too get somewhere . That said I do enjoy the story and it keeps me guessing who he is going to kill off after you have invested the time following them . Hopefully at the end of it all I wo n't go That 's it ! ",3
"Got the first four books in the box set as a gift after saying I was interested in it . Read through those and it was finally time to pick up the latest . I have really been enjoying the series as a whole and this book keeps the interest going . There are very few times where I feel like I do n't care about the characters or what 's going on . Clearly Jon and Tyrion carry the bulk of my interest but every character presented makes me interested in what 's going on both in the world in general and with the characters specifically.With this book the structure was slightly different as it picks up with characters that book 4 did n't touch on at all until the timelines finally sync between this book and the end of book 4 . The end of the book really blew me away and was not something I was really expecting.Needless to say I ca n't wait at all until book 6 comes out . At least there 's the HBO series to hold me over until that book finally comes out . And there 's more things that Martin is writing outside of the main series that covers the history of the world that I 'm looking forward to getting my hands on and reading as well . ",4
"I put out off reading this for as long as I could hoping book 6 was coming out.I enjoy Mr. Martin 's writing style a lot and like all the books in the series so far.My only complaint about the series is how long it takes between the books . ",4
"This was a gift for my husband . He found it very ver good but you must read the 4 books that came in series before . ",4
"a much better storyline and character development than book four . I am wondering who is left to kill . waiting for book six.. ",3
"Well I gave this four stars because I love the series . I had bought the other books for my father who was 86 and did n't have HBO at his house so he did n't even know about the story . He came to live with me while he was sick with colon cancer and he had decided against any treatment . I had HBO Go on my IPad so I caught him up on the previous seasons he had missed . The series was on hiatus at the time . He loved it as I knew he would because he loved Sci Fi . My father was an avid reader and his only complaint about the books was n't really a negative he said boy there are very strange names so many families that it is hard to keep track of . Knowing my father though it did n't take him long to sort it all out so when he would talk about the book he spoke of the characters by name . His health deteriorated quickly but he decided to buy this book any way . I did n't know and I 'm sure he was n't aware that he was ordering a hardcover book and that it would be so heavy . Needless to say he could n't hold the book up to read and as he was slipping away more each day I would try to read it to him but he was in and out of consciousness . He said to me one day I know I wo n't be able to finish this book and he was right he passed away shortly after . ",3
"Like Feast people knock this book for being slow . And like Feast it deals with the aftermath of a bloody book three . Someone has to put the pieces back together . This deals with how the characters put the pieces back together and whether they fail or succeed . Towards the end the tension of the first three creeps back into the story and leaves you waiting for Book Six . ",3
"It 's 230am and I just finished A Dance with Dragons . The book has more twists and turns to keep me immersed in the story . ",4
"I find myself compelled to finish this series for resolution despite being disappointed time and again as the 'good guys ' keep losing although I also have to take breaks between books as I sometimes feel as if I 'm slogging my way through a bog of violent images intentionally disturbing sexual scenes and repetitive description . Book IV read too much like something that was intended to be turned into an HBO seires at least this one reads more like a novel again . ",3
"There was too much fluff and my lord and not enough action . Where are Sanza and little finger ? I did n't like the overplay of the Wall and Jon Snow . ",2
"I have loved all of this series of books mostly because they are so very well written . It seems that many authors either do not proof read their books or they do n't care about mistakes in the printing but finding a mistake in one of George R.R . Martin 's books is rare indeed . I hope he keeps writing as I have a new favorite author . ",4
"I did n't love it the first time I read it through but I liked it more when I read it again . I ca n't wait for the next book ! ",3
"Oh ! I 've had the ups and downs with this series . The first book while interesting drew me in enough that I had to continue but did not excite me wholly . That was the job of the second book and the third . But now with the fourth and fifth books I find myself underwhelmed by the series and where it is going . I should caution if you have n't read the first book and all the others after it this review is not going to be helpful to you at the least . It is best to start at the beginning.There are many many plots and stories in this series . So much that it is hard to describe them with the detail that they deserve . But there are some large ones . Like the plight of Daenerys Targaryen and her dragons who only wants to reclaim the kingdom for herself . Tyrion Lannister who has been outlawed and must use his cleverness for not only saving his skin but furthering his agendas . King Stannis also trying for a throne that he thinks is rightfully his and the burning god that he claims to follow . And several others which like in all the books only want to play the game of thrones and win.Do n't get attached to the characters . That is the most important lesson that Martin gives us . You never know just how long they 'll be with us and it does no good to retain a favorite although sometimes it ca n't be helped . I find the dwarf Tyrion Lannister most intriguing and I know that I 'm not alone in that sentiment . He is so complex and I believe a good character that I find myself rooting for him quite often even when he does something that I do n't agree with . Arya Stark is a character that I did n't like in the beginning but her role in the books has become so intriguing that I look forward to her stories and what she goes through . For a little girl she is quite brave and devious . And my undisputed favorite would be Daenerys . She acts the true queen but still has enough innocence that she is quite likable . And she 's the character I identify with most although I am very much aware that I do n't possess dragons nor am I a queen . She is just that inspiring for a book character.As said before the plot is very twisted and there are many many characters . As such it can get very hard to follow and there are some chapters that I find myself drifting away from the book and not really caring about the characters featured . Not to mention that while this book had most of my favorite character 's stories it did n't have them all . It also went back in the timeline to the previous book and that was a tad confusing as well . I prefer it when things happen in a continuous timeline rather than bouncing back and forth . While there are some interesting aspects to this book most of it is a lot of talking and planning and quite frankly boring . I like intrigue well enough but when that 's all there is it sometimes makes you wish the book would just hurry up and get somewhere.I still like the series even if I think it 's gotten weaker in the past two books . There 's so much detail here that rereading the series over and over I 'm sure there would be something new found every time . I look forward to when the next book comes out.A Dance with DragonsCopyright 20111016 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2012 ",2
"So let us get some stuff out of the way . The first three are amazing . The fourth was lacking a little bit . Now that is out of the way lets talk about A Dance with Dragons.There is so much being thrown at this book series . I believe we should examine a few of them . The first I would like to address is I do n't care how long it takes in between books . I think people would be a lot more kind to this novel if it had come out a year later instead of six that it took . I would say that anybody that this bugs has a valid point but for me it just does n't matter . I wait patiently for these type of things . So while I think they have a point it did n't ruin any part of this book for me.Another thing is that nothing happens and that it is just a placeholder for this series . Again I could see it . Books four and five are the middle in this long series . Martin ca n't rely on it being new nor can he rely on its ending to maintain the narrative edge . So having said that I expected that these two would be like this . In a trilogy it is always the middle that suffers . When going into a massive series like this you need to give a little to get a lot . A trilogy is nice and clean having a beginning middle and end . A series of this size ca n't be like that . When entering into a saga of this size there is always going to be a little place holding . Some have commented on that certain characters take a step back in their development . This is also true . What the endgame is with this form of storytelling is that when the series is done that the impact will be greater on the reader than if told in a clean three act structure . This means that books six and seven could should be better for the very fact of the place holding that four and five have done . This will lead to the argument that this is all well and good but I just did n't enjoy this part of the story . To those people I would say that you are right in your opinion . It 's just that I have a big picture view while reading these books . Meaning that I enjoyed the heck out of this book.The argument has been made that it has to many new characters . I see them as frustrating as well but I keep in mind that characters grow more interesting the more you read of them . Perfect example would be of Davos . I was not that into him in book two . When I got to book three I loved him . This is Martin populating his Universe before he starts to break it apart . One good note that some might find interesting as I did is that Martin said that books six and seven will not contain any new POV characters excluding the Prologue and Epilogue . So if nothing else you wo n't have that problem going forward.One note of interest is that the critical reviews for this one have been very good while reviews on amazon have been less than kind . I thought when the critics reviews came out that everyone was going to be happy again . That did n't happen . It is for this reason I decided to write my review from this kind of perspective.I hope this review shows that I loved this book but understand where you guys are coming from . I think anybody that gave this book a one star review was right . That is what they believed . They can not be wrong it is their review . I myself enjoyed my time Westros . I love epic literature like this . I will be looking forward to the sixth book as I hope you are too . ",4
"I do n't mind books that are slow moving but my patience is being tested with this series.While ADWD at least fixes one of the major problems with AFfC since it does include the POVs of popular characters like Jon Bran and Dany each character faces more and more challenges and failures . But it does n't seem to be leading to anything . It 's just going on and on with new secondary plots being introduced but the overall plot of the series is no closer to any resolution.Like a AFfC there are still too many random characters with POV chapters that add nothing to the overall story other than filler . I found myself skimming over some chapters because they simply were n't compelling and I had no interest in what was going on.At the end of ADWD I was left with a lack of hope for both the characters and the storyline . It 's now a series of disjointed storylines with the empty promise of a satisfying conclusion.With only two books left I have my doubts about how the series will wrap up . But I 'm fully expecting GRRM to announce that ASoIaF will be a 10 book series now . ",0
"Again it would have been so much better if they had published books 4 and 5 together . I would have read a 2000 page book . Breaking up the character like this really sucks . Story is still amazing though . Do n't know what I 'm going to read now that I have to wait for book 6 ! ",3
"If you are looking at Book 5 you will know how George RR Martin can enthral the reader as he takes us on this wondrous journey through a world which appears in great chaos providing drama and mayhem aplenty . ",4
"Having read the first four books and finding the fourth lacking I nevertheless decided to read A Dance With Dragons . It 's pretty clear that Martin has become bored and has n't figured out how to bring all of the story lines to a fitting conclusion . So he content to keep writing about this knight or that knight . Interesting characters are less so now and new boring ones are created . I encourage everyone to read the first three books in the series yes ! But know that if you keep reading beyond three you 'll be disappointed . ",1
"great book for the series but Martin is taking way too long inbetween entries the his series i 'm starting to be afraid he wo n't be able to finish them . ",3
"This book is about people talking . And thinking . And making plans . Lots of plans . Plans made plans abandoned plans changed . But no plans acted upon oh no . We would n't want that . That would kill the immersion . Immersion in cement quickly hardening thickening much as the plot has never to move again.Immersion happens within a story around events and characters and locations you care about . Immersion in minor details unrelated to the plot in the histories of towns which you have never heard about and will never visit again what good is that ? If you were on a paid tour of historic landmarks in London and the guide began speaking of the history of New Zealand because you know Australia was a colony of Britain and New Zealand is right next door would you feel like you got your money 's worth ? Of course not.George bombards us with copious descriptions of food and ruins serving no purpose beyond his transparent desire to showcase the detailed history of his world . Dragons came things done got burned now they 're ruins . We got it the first ten times . We especially got it after Tyrion took a mindnumbingly boring carriage ride to nowhere . You know the one where he woke up ate several paragraphs of food took or witnessed pisses looked out the window and described a ruin ate more paragraphs then slept and repeated it . And repeated it again . And again . And again . And suddenly the chapter was over and you were left wondering how any editor worthy of the title had left that in the book . If you were like me you wondered that several times while reading this book.Dany as a character is unrecognizable . Gone is the fierce Dany of old replaced by a painfully clueless teen girl with a mindless crush . A girl who worries more about what she 's wearing and who is staring at her than any events occurring around her . Twilight 's Bella would look down on ADWD 's Dany.Are they looking at my breast ? They should totally be looking at my breast . I want them to look at my breast . Ooh a penis . I 'm turned on . Can they see that I 'm turned on ? They should totally see that I 'm turned on . SHUT . UP . I half expected Dany to whip out her phone and textlike omg dis guy iz SOOO totes hawt ! LoL > P~~DrAgOnQuEeN Dany~~ This book could have had interesting moments but they were all killed with chapter after chapter after chapter of setup and minor plot details hashed out in painful detail . So when the big reveals finally come they 're things you knew about hundreds of pages ago making you wonder why the revelation was left hanging at the end of a chapter as if it were a big deal . Showing the same revelation from multiple points of view is n't interesting it 's unnecessary . Show it from the point of view which would have the most impact and at the time when it would be most startling then get on with the freaking story.Not even the cliffhangers are really even all that interesting because they 're just more setup . More setup instead of something actually happening.If AGOT had gone at this pace the book would have ended with Ned and Robert arriving back at King 's Landing after having described every meal and farmhouse to be eaten or seen respectively along the Kingsroad and with readers left wondering why it was called A Game of Thrones and not A Ride in Carriages . Just as readers of this book will be left wondering why it 's called A Dance with Dragons . Because fewer dragons make an appearance than do turtles . You can call it A Swim with Turtles if you 'd like . It 's a far more apt description of the book and its pacing.These last two books should simply never have been written . There is not enough story here for one book let alone two or three . And I do n't understand George 's sudden distaste for flashbacks . Some of the signature events of the series have been told entirely through flashbacks stories recollections and so on.Robert and Ned 's uprising . The Starks being murdered by the mad king . Jaime 's murder of Aerys and Ned finding him seated on the Iron Throne . The murder of Elia and her children . Lyanna and Rhaegar from the tourney to the Tower of Joy with mysteries as diverse as frog men and blue flowers . Tyrion 's wedding . Heck even recent events like Rob 's victory in the west and his marriage . All major events do not require bookschapters devoted to them.Considering that those events were told so well through flashbacks does anyone besides George honestly believe that the carriage rides and allaround NOTHING that has happened in AFFC and ADWD were so much story that they had to have entire books devoted to them ? Honestly ? After AFFC and the long wait I promised that I would only borrow ADWD not buy it . I made good on that promise as the lack of Amazon Verified Purchase on this review will attest . With George utterly unrepentant in regards to the pacing style and long waits for these past two books I am now promising the same for Winds of Winter . And I 'm not alone.This series may still be redeemable but I doubt that I will ever find it in my heart to forgive GRRM for making me DREAD Dany and Tyrion chapters . Dread it rhymes with bread served with bacon grease and garlic and oops I 've found myself randomly writing about food every few paragraphs since finishing this book . I 've also taken to letting food dribble down my chin since ADWD showed me that it is impossible for grown men or women to eat without slobbering all over themselves . It is known . ",1
"For the life of me I can not understand why EBooks aka Kindle copies are so expensive . It costs very little to produce and now that ebooks have become popular the price only seems to go higher & higher.As far as the Book goes I found it at a second hand bookstore for $ 7.00 . The story is so so and I agree with other comments that It 's turning is very slow unlike other earlier books . ",2
"What bothers me about this book is the obvious editing flaws like using the word widdle for little twice in 20 pages by two separate characters it has more impact if you choose it once for one character making fun of someones widdle toes or widdle fingers but not twice . I noticed it in the last book too with the word dun everything was described as dun which is a color so it was their dun breeches or dun mules or dun this dun that come on pick up a bloody thesaurus . However I do n't blame Martin who obvi has a lot of character development on his plate I blame his editors . Unfortunately that is not my only problemit seems like Martin could have really made an outstanding book here but chose a more circuitous route which made me feel disappointed . I know he likes to slowly develop characters and one of the characters I hated in the previous books but started to really sympathize with was Reek Theron . So kudos to him for that . However the dragons how are a bunch of unruly monsters ever going to be able to stage a comeback for Dany in Westeros . A little time spend in training them throughout this book would have given me some hope that they would be able to assist her in winning back Westeros sans Victarion . Or at least giving Dany the inkling that there was another Targaryen afoot would have been interesting.Also why do they always quote the Rains of Castemere did I miss some exciting ancient plot twist related to that song ? Help me out if you know the answer to that one . But I digress I got into these books after HBO and plowed through the first three which were absolutely amazing these last two have been a how can I say ita real bummer . The books are clogged with characters that in and of itself is sometimes hard to follow for me I wish there was a little more development of the lesser characters to make them more salient in my mind if you are going to bring them up every 200 or so pages make them stick please ! So many coats of arms so many banners all of them confusing I kept getting Roose and Ramsey confused . And the people across the narrow sea were melting into one save a couple characters . All in all I think I will like the next books if they flow as nicely as the first three come on Martin you can do it ! ",1
"I probably am not adding anything new if feels like I 've been reading Thai forever and am still not through it . I hope with the show going it will force this story somewhere . Anywhere . Because I feel like I 've read a billion pages and I feel nowhere . ",2
"Unlike the many readers who started this series and had to wait for years to read the next book I bought and read the first 4 and only waited a month to read this one . I will not be waiting for nor purchasing any further books in this series.Mr . Martin put together an interesting cast of characters . He developed them quite well . I became vested in their stories . I feel like I have been betrayed by the author through the deaths of some of them . Every book loses characters through conflict that 's what makes the story more real and more interesting at times . However manipulating the story line to make it seem that things are going one way only to chop down the character instead is something I feel is wrong.Throughout the series the tenor of the books has become increasingly dark . Things have become more violent sadistic and crude . I found that more and more disconcerting . It may be that Mr. Martin feels that this fits in better with today 's society and its tastes . I hope not . I have been reading fantasy for almost 50 years . There is some really great stuff out there but I 'm done with Mr. Martin . ",0
"Okso it 's book 5 read the other four so I 'm hooked . All in all a very satisfying readbut honest to goodness one just never knows who Martin is going to kill off ! I confess there has been more than one occasion where I tossed down the book any of the 5 in frustration as one of my favorite characters was killed.If you like this series book 5 does not disappoint ",3
"Continues the saga fills them gaps quicker reading than the other books . ",4
"Based on the other reviews I almost did n't read this book . I ended up enjoying it and the last 500 pages moved quickly . True nobody really gets to where we as readers want them to but the setup for book 6 is really interesting . That said Martin 's editor needs to get a bit more aggressive with the delete button and keep inanities such as dragon queen and fearless raider Dany saying one more time I 'm just a young girl and know little from creeping into book 6 . I enjoyed this more than book 4 which was a big letdown for me after the intensity of book 3 . ",3
"This was a tremendous undertaking . Different kingdoms different families everyone fighting for the throne . The whole series is great and I am so anticipating his next 2 promised books . ",4
"The story is compelling . I love the characters . Have since the first book . Tyrion is one of my favorite literary creations of the past 20 years . I still grieve for Eddard Stark . But holy mother of God Mr. Martin have them get off their bloody arses and DO something ! I do not want to wait another 5 years for A Song of Fire and Ice Vol . VI Marching Into Tedium.and another thing . Stop killing off your most beloved main characters . I spend 4000 pages getting emotionally invested in a character only to find out that they were a long term redshirt ? It does n't make me wary of things when it 's done too often and it 's done way too often it makes me feel as if the author has played a really big joke on me and he 's the only one laughing . So move the story along already and let someone live.To George 's editors grab your red pencils and do your job . Words are wind . Too much wind is a tornado . ",2
"I skipped Book 4 because it did not have my favorite characters . This is great and I do n't feel like I have missed a lot . ",4
"I think if you put a Feast for Crows into a single interwoven volume with Dance with Dragons and if Dance had been 200 pages longer there is a fine story there.Without a doubt there are great story lines and good characters in Dance . What is lacking is any discipline on the part of the author to honor that unspoken pledge with his readers to get the whole story out there in manageable form . Just when things get interesting he ends it.Feast had too much action . Dance not enough . Put them together and I suspect they balance out if you could sell the public on a 2000 page or so book.7 volumes should be enough to tell the story . But at the rate plot development is going it seems like at least 12 volumes will be needed unless things get totally rushed at the end.I would n't care if Martin worked with a good writing panel call 'em ghosts if you want since he is a wonderful story teller but perhaps not a wonderful writer . Then the database of character insights backstory history could be woven into a more compact more disciplined book . Or books.Things I did n't like about DanceDaenerys the second best character in the series seems incapable of being tough enough to rule and ditzes around then makes a horrible choice to avoid a war that is inevitable anyway . The real Dany only comes through in her last chapter.We did n't get enough of Tyrion at his best showing off what a wonderfully smart administrator and keen politician he is.Jon Snow is acting like he is 20 years more experienced than he is but makes some incredibly stupid choices at the end.Arya a really interesting character in the previous books has chapters that seem tossed off . What was arcane and mysterious a girl 's best adventure feel that somehow seems mundane on this revisit.This book is about a 3 Feast was about a 2 the series is better than a 5 . In this case the sum is much greater than its parts but I no longer have hopes that Martin will ever finish it . Clearly he has other projects not only HBO and at the same time he seems unwilling to take guidance from his editors and just get the book out there.On the other hand if he can get the next book out there in less than 2 years he will certainly probably win me back . I mean Dickens and Dumas pounded out great pulp fiction pulp fiction that was at the same time art and Song of Fire and Ice clearly has that potential as well . ",3

A great read . ",4
"The book was great the ending was unsatisfying . This book did not clarify what happened to all of the characters that we have grown to love in the books and HBO .

"George Martin is a great story teller ! Rich story plot but well told . Characters are complex but their changes development is logical and believable . wonderful ",4
"I love these books so much . Martin does a wonderful job of pulling you into his world . I 'm looking forward to the rest of this series . ",4
"This series may have been inspired by the Wars of the Roses but readers now find themselves in the grim landscape of the Hundred Years War.I start with 5 stars for good writing inventiveness seriousness of theme and purpose and in general what I would call truthfulness . What I mean by that is that most of the more dire events throughout the entire series have been set in motion by the follies and failures of various of the characters . For example the sequence of events which ended in the Red Wedding began with Caitlyn . She presumed to insert herself into war and statecraft persuits for which she had no training and less aptitude . Possibly she did so out of a deep seated jealousy of the intriguer Cersei . She failed in her duty to provide motherly comfort and support for her remaining son provoking him into an unwise marriage and then compounded that folly by seriously underestimating the vengefullness of the Freys.I take away one star for poor as in perhaps nonexistent editing . For this there can be no excuse . This series has been lucrative for author and publisher alike . The publisher could and should have afforded editing which might have excised some of the too often repeated phrases maybe pointed out to Martin that Tyrion the Oversexed Dwarf does not make a good picaresque character.I take away another half star for what I think are structural flaws which have plagued the entire series . Chief among these is the conceit of telling the story through the increasingly clumsy device of POV chapters . I think so intricate a story could have been better told by straitforward narrative . Another half star for borrowing a new plot devicethe heir in exilefrom another recent fantasy series and doing so badly . That leaves a three star rating.Martin 's writing is far better than what is on offer from most of his contemporaries and this book has its moments . The two scenes between Lord Manderly and Davos the King 's Hand were my favorites also the Prince of Dorne makes a welcome reappearance . Please let us have more of the Sand Snakes some of the most delightfully wicked female characters to appear in popular literature for some time . But something is going seriously wrong when the minor characters steal the show from the major ones . I have never been able to abide Tyrion the Oversexed but as a strategist he had some interest . A picaresque hero he is not . He has neither the humor nor the humanity for such a role . Jon Snow is a good character whom Martin did n't seem to know what to do with . Take away Dany 's clarity of thought and purpose and you are left with another willful teenager.I am wondering to what extent Martin is being influenced by the producers of his HBO series because some of the more unwelcome developments in the book such as dumbded down Dany are exactly what one would expect from the idiots in TVland . Do we now have a new heir because HBO needed a beefcake male lead ? ? Usually they wait till a work of fiction is FINISHED before they ruin it.There is a work of greatness buried in this series . Its ' theme IMHO is justice . I think the theme explains the lenghthiness of the series . These books are not and I would suggest are not meant to be adventure stories . Martin shows us cities and provinces both well governed White Harbor and neglected and plundered King 's Landing He shows how seemingly small acts of selfishness or foolishness can have large even dire consequences . The bleakness and misery depicted are what happens when there is no justice to be had . Thugs wicked lords and their retainers blood soaked cultsand serial killers do flourish in a Randian universe . And that home truth is one which many readers do n't want to hear so they complain a bout lengthy wait or boring descriptions etc etc.My suggestion to Mr. Martin would be a just like George Lucas he needs an editor and b he should tell the HBO vampires to take a hike .

"So many twists ! Aaaaaaand we do n't know who 's dead or not dead or about to be dead at the end of it ? Ca n't wait until the next book comes out . Maybe I 'll start over and read them all again from book 1 . ",4
"I do n't know how anyone who claims to enjoy the song of ice and fire saga could not love this book . Pure genius . Martin has created an entire realm of people and places that makes me wish the series would never end the characters have such stirring personification that they have become part of my world invoking feelings for the characters . I love this book although a slow start recapping the previous portion of the story I love every sentence of this series . This is a must read for any fantasy reader ! ",4
"The 5th book is just as heartwrenching as the rest but I would highly recommend it you wo n't regret it . ",4
"This series needs serious editing . There are so many character that it becomes unwieldy . The big problem is that nothing joins the characters together . They never interact . His last 2 books could have easily been a book of short stories about this realm . Many characters never advance the story . The story moves at such a glacial pace you stop caring.It is a big shame could have been a classic work like the Lord of the Rings if GRRM had the discipline to stick to fewer viewpoints and tightend up the story . Instead he goes down the path of Robert Jordan and indulges himself with writing about everything under the sun . ",2
"I have fallen in love with all the characters in this book whether its because I truly love them or just love to hate them ! I ca n't wait for the next book to see where the story continues ! ",4
"This is just one of those series that you absolutely have to read do n't delay otherwise you will not know what the popular topics of conversation are all about Very well written and I can not wait for the next instalment ",4
"first build up a character as though heshe is indomitableindefatigable and is going to be central to the plot.and just when you are enjoying that character then suddenly kill that character and leave the reader in utter shockdisbelief.seems to work every time in each of his books in the series.and another 5 year wait for the next sequel ? sigh ",3
"I will make it short and sweet . I could n't put it down . You 've come this far . Keep going it will be worth it . ",4
"My mother and friends love these books I have been hearing about them since they first came out over 10 years ago . A great series everyone should get them . ",4
"Ok Mr Martin I 'm ready to read book six already . Sure wish you would let the good guys get a break now and then but that is my only complaint about this book . Please hurry with the next one Ser ! ",4
"GRRM writes so well he almost gets away with not having much plot . Almost . I was unable to put down the first four installments in the Game of Thrones series not so with Dragons sorry to say . In fact it was something of a chore to get through . I would say I do n't want to give anything away but honestly there 's not much to give away . I felt a little irritated that after 1000 or so pages very little had really happened . Big yawn . ",1
"I really hate to say this butI loved the first 4 books in this series . I grant you some more than others but love them I did . So it pains me to admit that I have no love for this installment . In fact i am shocked to say I found it extremely tedious . There was so much journeying and very little arriving that it was like an interminable one step forwards two steps back talky travelogue . It seems GRRM may need a more assertive editor.I knew that his book was going to feel more like book 4 volume 2 than a book 5 but I still found it disconcerting that ADWD went back over already travelled ground . I would have preferred that the two books had been split by time rather than POV but that 's just me . At about the 70 % mark it did get somewhat more interesting..When Cersei 's story was continued I became more engaged but Briennes story development was kind a wtf moment for me . Did I misread that last time we saw her ? No explanation really ? Tyrion usually a POV I enjoy the most was one I found myself reading some pages and skimming many others . My heart sank in disappointment a couple of times when I approached his chapters . What a yawn.I also thought that the sexually explicit scenes and vocabulary while always on the crude side veer further into the arena of the gratuitous and perverse n this book . Especially when it comes to describing women . It came across as relentlessly demeaning . One scene in particular comes to mind a certain wedding night . I understand that the behavior of the groom was in line with his character but the bride was supposed to be only 10 or 11 yrs old ! A line was crossed there for me . GRRM just loves the C word does n't he ? It never bothered me previously . I barely noticed it before but it irritated me at times with this one.So sadly this was a disappointing read for me . ",2
"Here it is ! I could n't wait for the release of this book ! The author answers lots of our questions but leaves lots of story lines for the next book . I ca n't wait ! This has been my favorite series of all time Hurry up Goerge ! I ca n't stand the suspense ! ",4
"Six years after A Feast For Crows indicated Martin had lost control over his narrative A Dance With Dragons essentially confirms it.This book is by no means as bad as the previous one Feast was an unmitigated disaster . This one had some interesting twists intriguing scenes fun moments gritty depictions of a brutal winter campaign and some entertaining chapters concentrating on Victarion . But one main purpose of Dance was to concentrate on the stories of three main characters who were completely ignored in Feast Tyrion Lannister Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen . Jon 's story arc actually has some closure . Tyrion bounces around in fits and starts flashes his great wit and becomes a clown . Daenerys frets whines dawdles lives a life of luxury while the city she conquered deteriorates into dust has various bouts of porn sex with a random lover and makes Rand al'Thor from The Wheel of Time books 68 look active involved and decisive.Other storylines moved forward Bran others moved sideways and yet more players entered into the great game of thrones . Can Martin resolve his story in just two more books and less than 11 years to produce them ? Not at this rate he has too many characters just making small moves on an enormous chessboard . Martin 's style does n't help he indulges in the Jordanesque trademark of lengthy descriptions of dress and uniform Martin 's indulgence is heraldry and whatever Dany 's wearing Jordan 's was women 's medieval dresses when he should take a couple of lessons from Hemingway or Hammett and reduce the background noise so he can move the story forward . And his editor needs a new pen to clip the extraneous words.All said better than Feast but not near the quality of books 13 and there 's too much left unresolved to believe the series can end in 7 books . ",2
"The story continues and it is still exciting and worth the read . Tyrion 's story continues I was left wondering about him at the end of the last book . As usual any book by George R.R . Martin is good reading . ",4
"GRR Martin continues the Westeros saga in this 5th installment out of an estimated 7 . Book number 6 is expected in March 2013 and I for one can hardly wait for it . For fantasy fans and Martin readers A Dance with Dragons is more of the same great stuff that makes his work so addictive ! ",4
"I 've edited my review to 1 star . This is an improvement over Feast of Crows . I 've also seen it compared to Jordan 's Crossroads of Twilight . I do n't believe it 's anywhere near as bad as that . That being said it 's not good.Good thingsOne . Pacing . Feast suffered from pacing issues . I think this was caused by the splitting of the novel . Since everything that happened focused for the most part around King 's Landing it did n't have the feel that previous novels had . Martin is a genius at leaving you on the edge of your seat . You 're reading about Tyrion and the end of the chapter gets there and cliffhanger and you 're in a Jon chapter and although you love Jon you want to know what happened to Tyrion . Then he pulls you into Jon . Then Jon cliffhangers and it 's an Arya chapter . Feast was missing that but Dance has it back.Two . Everybody is back . There are n't many chapters but there are Jaime and Cersei chapters . There 's no getting to the end of the book and not having at least checked in on your favorites.Three . Style . Martin is still a good writer no question . He has been and remains a master of the written word . Period.Indifferent thingIt ends with cliffhangers and no plots are tied off . Well it 's part of a series . Plot was moved forward in this book make no mistake . Nothing was wrapped up but I wo n't complain about that for another two books . It is what it is.Bad thingsOne . Introduction of a major new character . One that was not foreshadowed set up or honestly needed . New characters are fine . Not pivotal ones . We should have a full cast at this point . Because one of two things will happen . Martin will kill him so what was the point . Two he becomes a major part of end story resolution so why did n't we have him sooner . It 's sloppy story telling.Two . Introduction of pointless minor characters . We get introduced to some new points of view . Some were characters we have seen before just never followed from a POV . One in particular was brand new . One was killed and I did n't care . It was a throw away character . Martin never made me truly care for him so there was n't the shock I had with Eddard 's execution or the Red Wedding . Since Martin does n't have a problem killing characters I was n't even shocked that he died . Just mildly surprised because it was sloppily done and not what I would expect from Martin.Three . Daenerys and Tyrion . Two of my favorite characters who were always guaranteed to entertain sucked . Tyrion was n't Tyrion . Yeah he 's dealing with some stuff but when has n't he . It was n't the same character from the first three books . Daenerys The one character who had a clarity of purpose and action at all times did n't throughout the whole book . you must go back to go forward . I read that and cringed . Eleven years man . The Daenerys storyline does n't need moved back . Nothing needs moved back.Four . Too familiar plot tricks . Another Stark does n't listen to his wolf . Tyrion 's wisecracks get him hit again and again and againFive . Stupid tricks . Not using the characters name in the chapter title but a description . For instance a Selmy chapter marked as Queen 's Hand . He does it alot and it gets annoying . You 'll see.So eleven years countless broken promises missed deadlines and half a novel for this . It 's not as bad as Crossroads of Twilight but Jordan did n't take eleven years to write it . Plus I 've edited my review to one because the number of lackluster 5 star reviews that use similar wording and seem fishy.. ",0
"I can not wait until the next one . I am sure it will be just as great . Truly wonderful in every way . ",4
"these books just keep getting better . I can not wait for the next installation . I love the direct delivery to my kindle . ",4
"A wonderful read after the less intriguing fourth book . Martin returns to his cliffhangers and twists that make you unable to put the book down . ",4
"Amazing book its a heavy read but you will not put it down . I do n't want to spoil anything but I simply can not wait for the next book . ",4
"This book is a short novella masquerading as a bloated tome . It desperately needs harsh and impartial editing.Even if you like the series you can skip this one in favor of reading the spoilers in the reviews here . Or perhaps just read the last 150 pages to get the cliffhangers but they are n't really cliffhangers since their outcomes have been so heavily foreshadowed you know what will happen . ",1
"Just like the others ca n't put it down . Got a little sluggish in the middle bit picked up and delivered ! When 's the next one coming ? ",4
"Worth the wait not sure . A good read ? Of course classic Martin leaves you wanting more hating him loving him and thoroughly depressed over the inevitable 5 year wait if we 're lucky until the next installment . ",4
"What can I say This is book five I have ordered I have enjoyed reading and sometimes it is hard to put down because you get so involved Love the twist and turns Great book ! ",4
"5 Star Review This book was awesome ! And it would have been even more awesomer if it had a plot ! 3 Star Review Eh it was okay . Could have used a plot.1 Star Review This book stunk ! Where 's the plot ? It 's unanimous ! This review will be replaced with a real review when the series is complete . Maybe . Hey I 'm not your puppy.Warning This incomplete series may have caused a slight case of Martin Derangement Syndrome in this reviewer . Consume responsibly . Limit 3 books per day . ",2
"At about 900 reviews to date of A Dance With Dragons I doubt my humble review will either encourage or discourage anyone from reading this book . However I feel the need to throw my hat into the ring.I HAVE read and reread the previous 4 books in this series . This will come as no surprise but I thoroughly enjoyed the first 3 books . In fact as a reader of fantasy I felt Mr. Martin brought a whole new dimension to the genre . He had a way of making us look at people and their motivations in a whole new light I always felt that there was a bitter truth to his writing that even though it was fantasy it was very much real yes there are people who are truly good and are not motivated by selfish interests but by the interest and betterment of others but there are many who are selfish willing to win at all costs and will do anything no matter how ugly to achieve their goals . IMHO no one could write those kinds of characters and situations like GRRM . Sadly in A Feast for Crows that began to change I believe I gave that book 3 stars with a wait a see about what was supposed to be forthcoming A Dance With Dragons.Forward to 2011 and A Dance With Dragons has arrived . Unfortunately I found it to be a major disappointment . It has a even slower pace who would have thought that possible than AFfC and my most beloved characters have taken a giant leap backward in their personal development . To all the 5 star reviewers I respect that it is a matter of personal opinion . I wish I could have loved this book as much as many of you do unfortunately I do not . Why ? Well here are several of my reasonsPossible Spoilers I do n't think so but ..Tyrion probably my favorite surviving character up to this point others I cared about had already fallen by the wayside unless strangly resurrected in this book I am not even going to go there . . .. He has always been a strong character great at plotting and schemes surviving against overwhelming odds by the use of his wit now he is a pale reflection of that character whiney playing a fool and if I had to hear where do whore 's go one more time I was going to scream.Daenerys A woman who has overcome unbelieveable odds virtually coming through the fire crossing deserts raising an army hatching dragons intent on her purpose to return to Westeros and reclaim the throne she feels was stolen from her family has become an ineffectual sex starved wannabe queen . The way she has turned on her dragons is so off character that it does n't make sense to me and also the fact that she can no longer make a decision.Pacing by the end of the book many of our characters never made it to their destination nor were there many plot resolutions . Since AG of T we have been teased about the Others yet what more do we know about them ? Poor editing . Introduction of too many new characters and too much detail in this book on minor characters.I could drone on like the book but what is the point . Personally I am done with the series . My ending goes something like thisOthers cross the walltake over all of Westeros turn everyone into other Others sail to all of the other kingdoms and zombie them also then they all live happily ever after . ",0
"It 'd been so long since the last installment to the series I 'd almost forgotten all the characters and definitely did n't know where we left off . Unlike all the earlier books I found it hard to continue to read this book I keep going I 'd rather get some sleep or um I 'd rather sit here for the next 30 mins . waiting for the movie to start then read this book . Not good . I did n't really care enough about any of the men claiming to be king of everyone to want to read anything about them who cares who wins since any of them is just like the next one and none of them is going to make much of a king . We waited so long for this book and what a disappointment . Feels to me like Martin 's publisher was breathing down his neck bigtime not to mention his reader fans so he just threw some emptycalories dish together and called it dinner . I hope the next one is much better . And I still say he ought to have written the Daenerys story as a separate offshoot like McCaffrey did with the dragonriders drummers singers etc . I always want to skip over the Daenerys chapters since I find them only distracting from the main storyif I ever reread this series and that is questionable I may buy used copies of the book and tear them apart read the main story first then see if the Daenerys story is worth rereading . I do not find her intriguing or beautiful since she 's just been using men and then she 's turned against her own dragons who brought her fame and fear . Martin had better make the next 2 books unbelievably great or his whole series will die . And btw maps on the Kindle at least the on with the 6 screen are always fuzzy and impossible to read and I have never figured out why when the Kindle opens a new book it skips over the cover the dedication page the author 's Prologue or whateversome of us like to read that stuff first it 's like having an appetizer before the main meal . Also want to comment that if Amazon continues to increase the price of Kindle books I may consider some other ereader when I want a new one . My friend uses an eReader and can download books free from the library . ",2
"I really enjoyed reading this addition of Game of Thrones . The author introduced new characters and a great deal more intrigue . He also continued to build on those characters that we know and love . In my opinion the most memorable scene was when the black Dragon appeared in the fighting pits . This was an overall great read . I hope all of you enjoy reading it as much as I did . FANTASTIC ! ! ! ! ! ! ",4
"Intrigue abounds at every turn . This is the best epic fiction I have ever read although I loved the Lord of the Rings as well . This appeals more with medieval overtones and chivalry and dragons . ",4
"I loved all of the books in this series ! I wish there were more books to read on these characters . ",4
"Loved every word of it I ca n't wait to read the next book . This book was almost impossible to put down . My hats off to Mr. Martin he has done it again . ",4
"George R. R. Martin 's A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE saga continues with the muchanticipated fifth in the series A DANCE WITH DRAGONS . For those not familiar with the series these are the books on which HBO 's Emmy award winning television series GAME OF THRONES is based . The first book in the series is titled A GAME OF THRONES . Martin 's series is peopled with what I consider to be some of the best characters in modern literature . These are multidimensional personalities with genuine emotions . The villains are not evil through and through and no hero is without blemish . This along with the fact that Martin is utterly vicious to his characters leaving the reader with the feeling that no one is safe within these pages makes these volumes a must read for anyone even remotely interested in the fantasy genre . That said A DANCE WITH DRAGONS is not flawless . Even for the initiated the first two hundred pages can be quite confusing . Martin does n't give us any reminders as to where any of these characters left off in previous volumes . Many of the most loved characters were not in book four A FEAST FOR CROWS and so their plot threads date all the way back to A STORM OF SWORDS released in 2000 . My memory just is n't that good . I would have enjoyed the story much more if there had either been a recap prior to the beginning of the story or at least some explanatory dialogue to help refresh the reader 's mind . Even after completing the book I 'm still not sure what Tyrion 's goal was at the onset of the story . All this to say that once I got into the flow of the story I could n't pull myself away from it . Martin is masterful when it comes to interweaving plot lines deceptions betrayals lost loves and fantastic action and suspense . Much of the focus for nearly all of the characters falls on Daenerys Targaryen the wouldbe queen of the seven kingdoms who is now the Mother of Dragons . Everyone either wants to manipulate use or defeat the young woman with a will of fire . And though she is the focal point for so many she is unaware of the scheming and infighting across the sea to the lands which she may one day rule . Readers beware there are some significant shocks in the second half of this tome and they are very well worth the wait . If you 've read the previous four volumes your wait will be well rewarded . If you 've never read this series I encourage you to get started with A GAME OF THRONES . You wo n't regret it . ",3
"I liked the book but did not like the way that it ended . The ending left too many unanswered questions that require another book for the series . ",2
"Incredible series and extremely hard to put down once you start into one of the books . Dark and feudal and most definitely bloody . Surprising how Martin seems to like the bad guys to win almost all of the time . But like most fans we surely do wonder when or if he will ever find an ending to this series . ",3
"I long for the series to continue . I ca n't wait for the next book . It 's an addictive tale with so may more possibilities . ",4
"Sorry to see the series end but an amazing read ! ! Game of thrones is one of the best books I 've read ",4
"Having read all 5 books I think it is time in book 6 or no later than 7 to bring all the threads together and wrap them in one glorious ending . Does anyone have a suggestion where all this should end up ? It is time for Dany to go to Westeros and clean house . ",3
"The first two chapter were somewhat interesting but after that it got very bland . It was like the author was trying to get somewhere but was killing off all the main character and left you without any sense as to what just happened . Did I fall asleep and just passed all the intigue and why he was going the way he went . It left me high and dry without any reason . Very disappointing after reading the first 4 books that were so great now this one horrible . ",1
"Too many characters to keep track of after waiting entirely too long for the 5th book . The book beat to death unrelated characters and bogged down in its mirco plots . The book was chopped to pieces . Maybe Martin will be able to bring it all together but I doubt I 'll live long enough to see that happen what with his world book signing tours and missed deadlines . Will I buy his next book ? NOPE ! I 'm done with Martin . I paid my money for the book and I was feel I was cheated . ",0
"I have been too busy reading these fantastic tales and now looking for more . Can not get enough of his writing . I think his next book is Winds of Winter and should be out soon . ",4
"I had looked forward to this latest novel of George R. R. Martin having enjoyed the preceding books in the series . What a disappointment frankly it was a grind to read and several times I almost gave up.He is doubtless a great writer with impressive prose and active imagination . However I found the story thread impossible to follow as it is disjoint.There are endless introspections and flash backs that add little to the story.He must have used the word 'jape ' and 'mummer ' a hundred times and I found it irritating.There are far too many secondary characters that left me confused and muddied the story line.The book is far too long for what it has to say.A pity . ",1
"I 'm pretty amused at all the people giving bad reviews to the FIFTH book in the series they have read . The same people will be preordering The Winds of Winter as soon as it becomes available.Yes the book moves slowly . At times Martin follows characters I do n't care about . About halfway through several characters get a bad case of the stupids simply to alter the plot . At the end you are n't sure who is dead and who has betrayed.But for hundreds of pages you are riding with Tyrion and waiting for his next bit of sarcasm . You are back at the Wall with Jon trying to manage an impossible situation . Daenerys Barriston the Bold Victarion and others make their way through the story.You have read the first 4 books so of course you will be reading this one . ",3
"Breathtaking as usual G.R.R . Martin still uses its magic pen . The reader is always surprised with new jumps in the intrigue . The Seven know how will the sixth book end I do n't . ",4
"If you read the others then I recommend this one . Dude this is the next book in the series . Its fun to read about the Starks and the Lanisters . And even mediocre Martin is better that most books out there . So yes I recommend this but it might take a while to get through it . ",2
"DRAGONS is a long book and a lot happens in it but it feels short on majorpivotal events either on the large scale or on a personal level . The closest things to major events come within a stone 's throw of the end but they 're only the beginnings of the events themselves and not coincidentally I was ready to make this a fourstar review until I got into the book 's last fifty pages . In one storyline a battle is shaping up between Daenerys ' divided city of Mereen and the armies and mercenaries of Yunkai and it appears to have begunbut we 'll find out for sure in the next book . In the North of Westeros two storylines and their characters meet headtohead in another major battlebut it takes place offstage we hear about it in a short letter which is probably not entirely truthful and we wo n't get the full account until the next installment of the series if ever . And on the Wall the storyline blows up in a three or fourpronged crisisand that 's it curtain and stay tuned for WINDS OF WINTER . And even the cliffhanger effect of this is undercut because it 's not the book 's last chapter . In a book this long we should have gotten the events themselves not just the slow buildup to them.Counting chapters I have n't tried to add up pages over half the book follows the three main storylines of DaenerysSer Barristan Selmy Tyrion Lannister and Jon Snow . The rest is shorter episodes from fourteen other viewpoints including some newlyintroduced characters . Daenerys kind of dithers in an impossible situation and Tyrion travels and travels and is not my favorite character though he appears to be Martin 's . I was most interested in events in the North and on the Wall and possibly the most gripping storyline is that of Theon Greyjoy the new Reek now a traumatized slave of the Bastard of Bolton . Bran Stark 's story advances only a few small steps and in a major disappointment we do n't learn anything more about the Others.In an afterword Martin says he found the writing of this volume extremely difficult I 'm paraphrasing . I have to acknowledge that the book shows evidence of a tremendous amount of research all this detail is not just made up and a lot of writer 's craft for example there 's a line casually included in Melisandre 's chapter that has significant implications for the fate of characters and the direction of the story and at least one of the cliffhangers . But one could wish that a little more writer 's craft had been applied to the structure of the plot or that a good editor with some backbone had been involved.Minor complaint You know nothing Jon Snow . I was so happy when Ygritte was killed off and we did n't have to hear this any more . Now other characters have picked it up and Jon has even started saying it to himself . Sheesh . ",2
"Ice and Fire Books 1 through 3 are brutal powerful and engaging if you can look beyond the cruelty and enjoy the game . Book 4 is brutal ponderous and not very interesting . Book 5 is brutal boring circuitous and disappointing and contains nothing but cruelty . Martin has lost the game dropped the reins left the building.Having just slogged through A Dance with Dragons I am no longer interested in the fates of the characters those who remain and Mr. Martin 's world has become an endless dreary hell of death destruction and despair . I will not buy Books 6 through Infinity as I do n't want to read about unrelenting hatred gratuitous violence baby killing blood sacrifice grotesque animal abuse face eating andor excrement eating body fluids gore little boys being thrown overboard because their kind should n't be allowed to live and men whose only use for women is to take them forcibly as a prelude to killing them . Really how many child rapes can an author cram into a series ? Hey ! I enjoy sex scenes as much as the next person but some of this dreadful stuff is kiddie porn.It seems that Mr. Martin continues to write not to advance the story lines established in Books 13 but to vividly describe each and every horrible way a woman man child infant or beast can be gruesomely hurt andor die . And oh yeah forget about dying and coming back to a happy afterlife ! Indeed every story development that could be considered even slightly uplifting was left hanging back in Book 3.In some reviews of the early Ice and Fire books Martin was favorably compared to Tolkien undeniably Martin can write a powerful description . And each author does have a doublebarreled middle name ! However Tolkien developed an intricate magical world in which loyalty compassion honor and evengasp ! love could endure . Martin 's world is so dark and his characters so despicable that nothing worthy can endure . Tolkien wrote about a quest Martin writes about what ? who cares ? Take the advice of many reviewers save your grey matter and skip this one . ",0
"The delayed fifth novel in the maligned A Song of Ice and Fire saga A Dance with Dragons chronologically coexists within the time period of the fourth book and beyond . The political maneuvering grows convoluted and much of the action occurs between chapters . A couple vague examples are where a fight or escape or other peril will begin at the end of a chapter to provide the clich & eacute cliff hanger . On the next character chapter the fight or escape or peril is over and one reads the aftermath . At least we have a lengthy description of the delicacies and wine at the dinner table though.The primary individual chapters are Jon Snow Daenerys Targaryen and Tyrion . Bran Davos Seaworthy and Theon Greyjoy compile the minor roles . Jon has probably the best progress in the overall plot maybe the book should have been titled Snowed in with Snow . Daenery dispenses justice over her people while trying to maintain peace disciplines dragons meets diplomats and dreams of sex . Tyrion as crude and funny as he can be is the most entertaining in a painfully prolonged journey . Theon 's effectively captures his cruel environment but very disturbing at times . Arya and Bran each have a couple potent chapters . Sansa and Rickon do not appear . As strange as it may sound I found one of the uniquely fascinating scenes involve Arya 's face.After waiting 6 years for a novel supposedly near finished when A Feast for Crows was published I 'm very disappointed in the end product . Tolkien is the only Tolkien I will never say otherwise . Martin has his own style with audacity and grittiness something many appreciated in the first foundation building couple books . The series is n't for everyone but those writing reviews are the ones who more often than not gave glowing reviews on the initial installments . I am one voice in a world where the author has made it clear many times he does not care what anyone thinks . I wonder if it applies to those who positively placate his ego . Reason I state it that way is because he does himself his fans and future fans a great disservice by not heeding any criticism by blinding himself like a nave prince . I think his initial potential is being squandered.A greater assortment of major and minor characters from lords to stable boys requires a more detailed appendix perhaps a section in alphabetical order . A small dictionary of important words would be valuable . Some portions of the map could have incorporated further detail especially the continents where the story relates.I recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre.Thank you . ",2
"If you have read all the previous books expect another AFFC in term of general plot development and satisfying resolutions not much.If you are new to the series I can only recommend to wait at least till the next book or even better till the end of the series.First three books were great and I would recommend them to anyone who has nothing to read because they are very good by themselves.The last two volumes A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons are not that great . Almost nothing is really happening to move the plot ahead . You can get through them on a momentum gained from the first books but if the series are never finished Martin began to write them in 1991 so do your math it will be just a waste of time and a source of disappointment . ",1
"I feel that there were too many details and story lines that needed resolution.Characters left hanging . I 'm sorry that I ever started this series and I may be dead before thefinal 2 books are published . Perhaps I should create my own endings ? ",1
"With every chapter of this book things get more entangled . I was hooked from beginning to end although there were times when it was a struggle to get through . I ca n't for the next one to come out even though it 's going to take 20000000 years for it to come out . ",4
"Stop ! If you are a fan of the Fire and Ice series do not read this book . Nothing of import is going to happen and by skipping this book you still may still have the chance of keeping those warm fuzzy feelings you 've kept in regards to this series . ",1
"Martin is a very good writer . We have to understand that we 're reading an ancient political drama and a lot of the time in a feudal society people die . But Martin seems to forget that most people read epic fantasy books for a dramatic story of protagonist and antagonist with eventually the good side winning in the end . Its called an escape from reality for a reason . In the Song books no one ever wins.As the series goes on it gets slightly more depressing . Not in the 'Harry Potter ' way either unless Harry dies in the first book and Hermione is raped every now and then . But in a way that seems that even when the series is all over and even if humanity survives in the end who really cares ? Everyone you cheered for is either dead or crippled and Martin is going to be discussing what the few survivors are eating or something.Overall I enjoyed the book I 'm just disappointed with the overall downturn of the series . ",1
"But alas George is not edited enough . The story is so great why must he blunder on about food and send us on wild goose chases before something that affects the plot happens ? It 's getting worse and worse with each book . The first three were masterpieces . George ! I implore you as a fellow author . Let your editors edit ! ! This blathering does not become your genius.Anyway I loved the story and characters and so I 'm hooked until this is finished . I 'm praying for better critique partners and for the author to heed their suggestions . ",4
"Another page turner with twists and turns holding you to the moment . You read and read hoping for answers only to find the end is nowhere in sight . Cliffhangers in onions snow blind girls and beggars will have you surfing for more and praying George Martin gets on with the Winds of Winter . Thoroughly enjoyable . ",4
"After reading four of the books and they were great while I was reading them I began to wonder if the reason GRRM has a difficult time writing these last books in the series is because he does n't have an end plan in mind . I do n't really like the fact that after following my heros for four books he decides to kill them off . The many minor characters he creates are interesting but they wo n't keep me reading to the end of the series . I want my heros back ! ! ! ",2
"Too many new stories were involved . like the deathlyhollows it just kept on and on.i do admit it keeps me guessing ",3
"I love this set of books best fantasy in quite a while . Everytime I think I know whats going to happen something different happens . Kept me surprised which is hard to do after reading fantasy for 30+ yrs . Ca n't wait till the next one and the HBO series is fantastic . Follows the story as well as a series can . ",4
"Wow ! At the risk of incurring the oh so insightful disses of my positive review from the trolling trolls going through and accusing the writers of roboreviewing or of having been somehow monetarily compensated by GRRM for their having attested to liking his book let me just say I loved this one . I guess I can take solace in the fact that my reading preferences jibe with those of the literati reviewing for the major publications and I can also take comfort that my reading preferences do NOT jibe with those of the illliterati who have apparently nothing better to do with their time than endlessly comment on other reviews of this book . What 's the matter guys World of Warcraft lost it 's luster ? I can understand someone not liking a book what I ca n't quite comprehend is someone making it their life 's mission to excoriate the opinions of those who disagree . Who exactly is getting paid for what here ? ? ? ! As far as my review as my rating shows I really enjoyed this book . Others have mentioned that the Dany chapters were meandering and draggy and seemed bogged down and I have to agree . That 's the 12 star off for me . Otherwise I thoroughly enjoyed reading this one . I for one adore the descriptions of food and heraldry and muck and grime it made the story very real for me and immersed me into the world GRRM has created . I especially loved how he counterbalanced the rich feasts for some with the desperate meals of horseflesh or worse for others . The aftermath of war and the precursor of another war plus Winter coming are harsh realities felt more by some than by others at this juncture . Anyone else find the pork dishes suspicious ? Both the roast pork Coldhands brought to Bran et al and the giant Pork Pie Manderly served up after the disappearance of the Freys ? I also appreciated how much I started DISliking Tyrion in this one . He did something awful and his conscience is suffering and he is whinging away and selfpitying for a good part of the story . It felt very real to me and it was very well done.The surprise introduction of another contender for the throne was also a lot of fun and I really loved the Varys bit at the end . Oh no he did n't ! Ca n't wait to see the fallout from all that ! The book felt to me much like the opening of a chess game with all the pieces being moved into place for the big finale.I for one am hopeful that the finale lives up to the buildup . It seemed an impossible task to pull it all together in the end but even though AFFC shook my faith a little this one restores it and I am going to be waiting a few more years I 'm sure to see how he starts wrapping it all together . ",4
"By the time I got to this book I had picked up on being able to understand what things were in the time setting and understood more so I did n't have to read so slow or reread or look up things to understand.and when I got to watch the HBO series I could put a face with the characters and knew exactly what was going on . ",4
"This the last George R. R. Martin book I will waste my money and time on . I absolutely loved the first four books of this series . At the end of the 4th book Mr. Martin said that originally all the material was to be included in the 4th book but since there was so much it had been divided into 2 books . Ok . But if that was truly the case why did it take so long for the subsequent book to be released ? Even so I waited until finally Dance With Dragons was released . What a tremendous disappointment ! Absolutely NOTHING was resolved ! So I 'm done . Done with this series and with George R. R. Martin . You 've gotten the last of my time and money that I 'm willing to waste on this silliness . ",0
"Very disappointed that is left unfinished . I must like it to have five books . Where is the the book that finishes the story . ",3
"Grudgingly I must admit I very much enjoy the series that G.R.R.Martin is pounding out here . The books are full of interesting characters often subtly drawn as well as strong in the broad stroke . For a while I threw the books aside sick to death of 'real politik ' and the slaughter or maiming of some of my favorite characters . But then I return . There are some large wheels turning in the background of pettiness and predatory politics and pointless wars and attacks upon the 'small folk ' . I do get a little impatient Let 's get to it ! but the story is told on such a broad front that it does take time and pages pages pages to get to the kill.Grudgingly I grant it a 94 . ",4
"This final book of the series ties up some loose ends but still leaves many questions unanswered . What happens to Arya ? What of Sansa ? We need more answers ! ",4
"and the stories and characters go on . with ever more twists and turns we are treated to more great story telling and now must wait for more ! ",3
"I really enjoyed this book . Not too much I can say about it without spoilers but it was definitely my second favorite of the series right after A Storm of Swords . ",4
"I very much enjoyed all five books however I was disappointed there was no ending . It just leaves you wondering what happens . Winter never comes ! I read the last book over a year ago . I thought Mr.Martin would have wrote another by now . ",2
"I like everyone else waited along time for this book . what a waste . I felt like it was a robert jordon book where everyone traveled everywhere but noone did anything . I kept waiting and waiting for it to get better but it did n't . Reek 's character was great Asha interesting but the rest he just left blowing in the wind . excuse blowing on the ships or in some far off kingdom . Take us down mainstreet and get to the meat of it already ! ! ! ",1
"I w a s hoping that this would shine more light on t he finish of this story instead I am left feeling at loose ends . Hope the next instead lament does n't take y ears in the completion . Understand a novel of this magnitude ca n't be written over knightbut after airing so long for this on thinking it was the end ell so m what left empty . ",3
"I really enjoyed part 5 of George R. R. Martin 's saga . This book did a good job of bringing his story back together so you could see that maybe the author really did have a plan . I thought this was actually the best of the 5 so far . wonder how far we will wait for the 6th book ? ? ? ",4
"I found this went too slow in places and wandered toward no given conclusion . I do hope the next novel ensures Jon Snow does n't die . He held the entire novel together . I give it four stars only because it did n't hold its plot tight in various places . ",3
"Spoiler alert.ProsCersei 's walk . Stone people on river . Warging in the beginning of the book with promise of Others . Take down of some of the Freys . Lord Manderly now that 's what I read these books for . What an interesting guy in such a horrible good way.ConsNo one gets anywhere everybody is in mid journey to get somewhere . Not enough of the dragons poor dragons . Dany becomes wimpy boring and is in love with a boor.Bran turns into a tree but for what reason ? No Jaimie or explanation of why Brienne shows up.Tyrion has a lot to do with traveling with another little person but nothing comes of it . Jon fights with everybody and does nothing but get stabbed in between organizing foodstuffs and talking to lots of people.And lots more . Too many people get killed off only to come back . Arya continues to get used to killing people . Same stuff . Sansa and Littlefinger not much happening either.Seemed to be full of fillers of Dorne descriptions and the new Ageon . Meerenese country and people so boring . Lots of descriptions of food and traveling and eliminating wastes from the body . Some violent and disgusting sex which seem like degrading s & m . In great detail . For no good reason to further the plot or show character development.Someone should edit this man . Dance and Feast could have been one short volume and something might happen in Winds . If it ever does get written.Do n't buy this . Just get it from the library and skim . ",0
"I should have read this sooner it fills the gaps in the HBO series somewhat with cliff hangers anew . Lots of dragon shenegens . ",4
"Excellent ! In this fifth book of the sevenbook series things unfold and many things stay open for the next books . The Starks are still eating the bread the devil kneaded and the direwolves are incredibly important but I hope to see Dany going to Westeros and finishing the Lannisters . I just wish Martin would let sleeping dogs lie ",4
"I invested way too much time in this series before learning after the fact that there was no ending . As much as I enjoyed the story I would not have started it if I knew it was never finished . ",2
"Yes it 's been a long wait . To tell the truth it 's been a very long wait . A wait that has spawned Grrrumblers and haters a wait that saw a lot of mud thrown the author 's way . A wait that has raised expectations to a level that is a little bit scary if you ask me . A wait that 's been made much more difficult given the fact that the latest volume A Feast for Crows was n't received as well as its predecessors.Hence the questions on everyone 's lips are Will A Dance With Dragons be worth the wait and can the book possibly live up to the lofty expectations this interminable wait generated . Well it is with great pleasure that I answer yes on both counts ! The fifth installment in the A Song of Ice and Fire sequence delivers on basically all fronts . It 's everything fans wanted it to be and then some ! A Dance With Dragons is n't perfect mind you . But it should silence George R. R. Martin 's harshest detractors and demonstrate once again that when he is writing at the top of his game very few SFF authors past or present can spin a yarn the way GRRM can ! Here 's the blurbIn the aftermath of a colossal battle the future of the Seven Kingdoms hangs in the balancebeset by newly emerging threats from every direction . In the east Daenerys Targaryen the last scion of House Targaryen rules with her three dragons as queen of a city built on dust and death . But Daenerys has thousands of enemies and many have set out to find her . As they gather one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen with an entirely different goal in mind.Fleeing from Westeros with a price on his head Tyrion Lannister too is making his way to Daenerys . But his newest allies in this quest are not the ragtag band they seem and at their heart lies one who could undo Daenerys 's claim to Westeros forever.Meanwhile to the north lies the mammoth Wall of ice and stonea structure only as strong as those guarding it . There Jon Snow 998th Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch will face his greatest challenge . For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond in the land of the creatures of ice.From all corners bitter conflicts reignite intimate betrayals are perpetrated and a grand cast of outlaws and priests soldiers and skinchangers nobles and slaves will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles . Some will fail others will grow in the strength of darkness . But in a time of rising restlessness the tides of destiny and politics will lead inevitably to the greatest dance of all.The worldbuilding has always been one of my favorite aspects of this series . Granted GRRM keeps his cards pretty close to his chest in that regard and has been doing so since the very first volume . Hence the tantalizing glimpses he offers us from time to time add new depth to an already convoluted overall story arc and multilayered plotlines that form the backdrop of the entire series . This time around we finally learn more about the Doom of Valyria . More background information about the land beyond the Wall the Free Cities Slaver 's Bay and Westeros ' past is unveiled in various POV sections of the book . I particularly enjoyed Sir Barristan Selmy 's POV section . Having served a number of kings as a member of the Kingsguard the knight offers an interesting perspective regarding the events which led to the current conflicts on both sides of the Narrow Sea.Many feel that A Feast for Crows ' biggest failing was the tight focus of the narrative on a limited number of story arcs . For better or worse Martin and his editors elected to concentrate on the events occurring in and around King 's Landing the Iron Islands as well as Dorne . Many felt that this tight focus prevented the novel from being as epic as its predecessors . Which I would have to agree is true . On the other hand A Dance With Dragons is a sprawling monster of a book . The action takes place in a panoply of countries regions cities and locales each with their own flavor . As such A Dance With Dragons is in style and tone more akin to the first three volumes than A Feast for Crows.The characterization is head and shoulder above basically anything else on the market . At his best Martin can do things with his characters that other authors can only dream of . And let me tell you that GRRM is in top form in this book ! Understandably the bulk of the novel is comprised of Jon Tyrion and Daenerys ' POVs . This should please fans who have been clamoring for these characters for over a decade . And yet the secondary POV sections for me at least are what gave the book most of its more memorable moments . Which is not to say that the Big Three did not deliver . But the supporting cast is responsible for quite a few surprises along the way.To a certain degree A Dance With Dragons is Jon 's book . Becoming Lord Commander 's of the Night 's Watch has forced Ned Stark 's bastard son to mature quite rapidly . Winter might be coming to Westeros but on the Wall it 's almost there . It is up to Jon to prepare the North for the coming of the Others and some of his decisions will not sit well with the rest of the Watch and everyone else . Duty appears to be a main theme in both Jon and Daenerys ' storyline with both protagonists following different roads as they attempt to deal with the hand they were dealt . Jon though he is forced to make choices that might cost him his position and more accepts the responsibility which has been trust upon him and puts into motion various schemes that will help the North face the menace posed by the coming of a long winter . In this he is definitely Ned Stark 's son putting honor and duty before his own desires . The character growth is evident showcasing a young man dutybound to protect those serving under him and the innocents he has vowed to protect . The Wall may be crumbling the various forts unmanned Stannis and his Queen major pains in his side yet Jon strives to remain true to himself and his oath.Daenerys on the other hand refuses to do what she must . She understands her duty knows what needs to be done but she is loath to give the order that will see blood spilled in the streets of Meereen . This came as a decidedly unpleasant surprise for me . Dany came a long way since we first saw her as a beautiful and innocent teenage girl in A Game of Thrones . I was expecting a woman grown in A Dance With Dragon mother of dragons and rightful queen of Westeros ready and willing to do what needed to be done so she could claim her birthright . Tempered by loss and war I had expected Daenerys to have matured to be a queen in deed as much as in name . Unfortunately the ordeals have left her a frightened and ambivalent ruler unwilling to pay the price to do what she has traveled across half the world to achieve . Beset by plotting and threats from every side her narrative is filled with a girl dealing with moral dilemmas and refusing to act as a queen should . Disappointing to say the least . Will she act before it 's too late ? Tyrion 's arc offers the highest number of surprises . Though our favorite dwarf will always be his witty self everything Tyrion has gone through in the last few months has left him a bit more thoughtful and humane . Still his narrative will get a fair share of laughs and chuckles out of you . With a price on his head Tyrion must find a way to reach Daenerys anonymously not an easy feat for the Imp . But soon he becomes privy to a closely guarded secret that will shake the world . It came as a shock to me that such an important story arc could make its appearance so late in the game . I guess that GRRM has many more surprises up his sleeve.As more than half of A Dance With Dragons runs in tandem with A Feast for Crows the first 500 pages or so features a few Bran POV chapters . Nothing that offers any sort of resolution of course but his plotline moves forward albeit not as much as most fans would like . There is a new POV character that plays an important role in this novel . However since this is a spoilerfree review going up before the pub date I will refrain from saying more . Suffice to say that this new POV offers new perspective on certain events past and present and is linked with a number of ongoing plotlines . Just when you believed that A Song of Ice and Fire could n't get more convoluted A Dance With Dragons raises the stakes even more . Secondary POVs include Davos and Reek both of them meant to pave the way for what 's taking place in the North . The same goes for Asha Greyjoy 's POV.As A Dance With Dragons moves beyond the fourth volume in the timeline the narrative returns to the Dornish storyline which gathers momentum and rises to a new level . As if there was n't enough politicking thus far we soon realize that Prince Doran is not the feeble ruler many believe him to be . Victarion Greyjoy Jaime Cersei and Arya all have POV chapters in the second portion of the book but these chapters more or less set the stage for what will happen in The Winds of Winter . As I mentioned the most interesting POV character in the latter part of the book is Ser Barristan Selmy . In addition the mysterious and shocking storyline tied to Tyrion early on get its own POV character just before the end of the book indicating that nothing will be the same in Westeros from here on out.For such a huge novel the pace is seldom an issue . GRRM juggles quite a few balls simultaneously tying up loose ends here and introducing unexpected plotlines there . So for the most part the rhythm is fluid and the book is a pageturner . Only the Daenerys POV sections drag after a while making me wonder why Martin bothered to write so many chapters devoted to her when sevral are just about her wondering what to do and refusing to do what she must . But other than that this is a book that will keep you up past your bedtime for a few nights.What many might find offputting is the fact that basically all the principal story arcs end with cliffhangers . And I 'm talking about major cliffhangers here especially that which caps off Jon 's plotline . In a series that 's had its fair share of startling scenes and moments A Dance With Dragons has one that 's right up there with the Red Wedding ! Still the absence of any sense of resolution might annoy some readers given the fact that we are all aware that volume 6 will not be published next year.In the end I feel that A Dance With Dragons is everything ASOIAF fans could have hoped for . It showcases a George R. R. Martin writing at the top of his game moves the tale forward like no other installment to date . Those naysayers proclaiming that GRRM had lost his focus and the will to see this project through are proven wrong . Not only is this novel all that the others were but GRRM raises the stakes to an even higher level then before . The lack of a true ending might irk some readers sure but A Dance With Dragons offers so much in terms of plot movement revelations and shocking moments that it does n't truly matter a whole lot . And it sets the stage for an unbelievable The Winds of Winter.True George R. R. Martin may be a slow writer . He likes to go to conventions . He loves football . He likes to edit anthologies and work on the Wild Cards books . True he 's busy working in tandem with the HBO team on the TV series . True he most probably ca n't devote as much time as he 'd like to finishing A Song of Ice and Fire . But you know what ? If I must wait a few years to get a book of this quality I say it 's worth it . . .As most of you know I won a football bet with George a while back . I lost our first two bets sure but that 's got nothing to do with it ! P Anyway my winning meant that he would base a character on me and then butcher him in a violent and bloody fashion . That was my only demand . I wanted a memorable death . Enter Ser Patrek of King 's Mountain a Montr & eacuteal reference since we met at Worldcon in 2009 . You may notice that the heraldry of Ser Patrek 's House is pretty similar to the colors of the Dallas Cowboys . That 's no coincidence . I was expecting George to create a very minor character based on me and then kill him off on the following page . But it was very nice of him to make me a knight of Queen Selyse 's entourage to make me appear in a few chapters so I could make an ass of myself and to kill me yes quite violently ! in what is probably the most spoilerfilled chapter of the novel ! It 's the ultimate fanboy moment to be immortalized in such a way . You 'll see . It 's a good death ! Impossible to put down.Roll on The Winds of Winter ! ",3
"This review will contain mild spoilers . You 've been warned.This book was considerably better than A Feast for Crows . It had characters many were looking forward to Jon Dany and Tyrion but the story did not move nearly as much as I expected it to and hoped it work . The east Mereen has not moved forward much . Dany is not much closer to Westeros and is perhaps farther from that . Tyrion did not make it to Dany and the journey with Penny seemed to be irrelevant and boring . Much of the planning in Dorne seemed all for naught which is n't a problem but I feel the book would have been better without Quentyn in it at all.On the plus side Arya 's and Samwell 's sections were interesting but too few and far between.This series will not be finished in seven books unless the last two take place at a breakneck pace . ",2
"Ohhh Mr. Martin . You are a cad ! I was not to be disappointed in the latest book of your series but to wait so long for the sixth installment after that ending is deliciously cruel . After reading the 4 novel box set this book easily kept me enraptured . A must read for all of those who still believe in Dragons and a good plot . ",4
"I loved the first 3 books and got through each in about a week . The 4th was not as good for reasons folks have already mentioned but it still was readable despite some of my favorite characters being saved for book 5.After almost 1 month I am only 13 through the book and despair of finishing it . I have skipped some chunks that were most tedious but even the chapters where my favorite characters those few that have not been killed off or MIA the story is not compelling.I guess these last 2 books are bridges for the next one but good luck getting through this one.Maybe he is distracted by the HBO series or HBO is influencing the story but I fear I will have to put this book to rest after one last attempt . ",0
"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this series but as much as I enjoyed reading the other books I hated the ending in this book ",1
"As with all Martin 's books this one was entirely too long . Maybe he should think about breaking it up into three novels each covering the same time frame but different locations so as not to have to jump around so much ",3
"You know once you get addicted.. I still love the panorama of the new worlds but grieve the loss of so many great characters . I am just hoping Book 6 will bring everything together in a way that makes it all worthwhile and uplifting . ",2
"I did n't think A DANCE WITH DRAGONS was as bad as the 1star reviews suggest but at the same time I think I 'd be hard put to argue with any of them . The book is highly unsatisfying after a 6year wait which itself followed a promise or devout hope that the book would be published shortly as in the following year after A FEAST FOR CROWS which itself was about setup only for an almost entirely different set of characters . So any dangling plot threads from that book continue to dangle a the conclusion of ADWD . As for the dangling threads in ADWD it 's intriguing stuff I admit but when do we get to see them resolved ? Who can say ? Is the next book THE WINDS OF WINTER even a priority ? I have my doubts.Consider the following taken from a post from Martin 's blogHere 's the stuff I am dealing with right now reviewing pitch proposals and putting together the overplot for the new Wild Cards mosaic novel LOWBALL writing the first draft of my script for episode nine of season two of the HBO series GAME OF THRONES Blackwater and damn but this one is a bitch of an adaptation the original author made the damn battle way too big and too expensive working on a Nicholas van Rijn story for the Poul Anderson tribute anthology Gardner Dozois and Greg Bear are editing an especially noisy monkey since the deadline was today and the story is a long way from being done getting back into THE WORLD OF ICE AND FIRE the longpromised concordance I am doing with Elio and Linda which is almost three years late at this point and needs to be finished and delivered by year 's end roughing out the next Dunk and Egg novella the next story in the queue after I finished the Blackwater script and the Poul Anderson story planning for a long summer of travel the visit to Poland and Slovenia the book tour San Diego comicon worldcon in Reno Bubonicon and maybe another trip overseas in the fall for the HBO show depending working on a complete redesign of my website much needed and long postponed supervising and reviewing and approving materials for the games the cards the video games the comic books the replica swords the miniatures etc etc.I am exhausted just typing about it.And behind all that of course lurks Son of Kong the WINDS OF WINTER . Lurking BEHIND IT ALL is the WINDS OF WINTER . How can the author 's most popular work be lurking behind it all ? How can video games and websites take precedence over SONG OF ICE AND FIRE ? I hope I 'm wrong but I 've also read somewhere that Martin does n't intend to resume writing the next book until January . Might not all of this extracurricular stuff have been the reason for the long wait for ADWD ? I could n't say for sure but I suspect that is the case . Is Martin 's heart in it as much as seemed to be with the first three books ? Not for me to say but the list of things to do certainly is troubling.Anyway I wanted to give this book 2 stars but I am still interested in the story and reading its resolution some day . I also thought the epilogue salvaged the book significantly especially after the weak final chapter Dany . So I 'm giving it a grudging 3 stars instead . ",2
"I await the next with trepidation as I will have to go without sleep for several days . Fortunately I can blame my lack of sleep on the children I will ignore while reading the book . no I wo n't ignore my children but I will have some marathon sessions of reading . ",4
"The first three books were fantastic . You know why ? Stuff happened . Now Martin is too lost in his own mythology . I used to worry if Martin would ever finish the series . Now I wonder if that might not be a good thing . I hope the series gets back on track and does n't keep us waiting 5 years for another book where nothing happens . As it is I 'm starting to lose all faith in what started as a very promising series . ",2
"After I got hooked with the first book in this series I heard there is also an HBO series . I have n't watched it but definitely wanted to continue reading . A Dance With Dragons brings the characters together in a way that makes me anxious to continue with next book in the series.ca n't wait ! ",4
"I preordered ADWD and I repurchased and reread the first four books.ADWD SUCKS ! ! ! ! ! AHHHHH ! I WANT MY MONEY BACK ! ! ! This book was SUCH a disappointment.Let 's be clear I enjoy Mr. Martins ' writing style . His depth of character wicked twists breathtaking descriptions and a world that is unique and realistic.However this particular book SUCKED BEYOND ALL THAT HAS EVER SUCKED BEFORE ! ! ! I feel that this book is a stalling tactic for the HBO series to pull new fans into the series AND the next two books in order to make as much money as possible . I think Mr. Martin is fully aware of the suckyness of ADWD and as a fan all I can do is SMDH . Shame on you Mr. Martin ! It could still be good even if it was just a place holder ! This book was a drag a bunch of new characters I DO NOT CARE ABOUT I have been trained by Mr. Martins previous 4 books not to care too much for any character as they may be killed off at the drop of a dime I was bored with all the traveling here and sailing there and eating locusts and puppies and other nasty stuff and still not tying up any conflicts old or new just creating more and more and more conflicts . Enough is enough . I first started the series 2001 and I am too through ! I have also told all my friends and family who I bragged and bragged to about this series to that it is a big fat waste of time . I am selling my books to a newbie to the series . They wo n't know any better . SMDH . ",0
"I have to say that George RR Martin did a simply amazing job at making the impossible seem entirely plausible . Bloody Islands made me believe in the power of medicine men and Dance with Dragons makes me believe in the power to bring dragons to life . Excellent writing and story . ",4
"I loved all the books in this series . Now he has to write the next book so I 'll know what happens to everyone . The books are so much better than the TV show . ",4
"Not a whole lot happens in this vol but its still full of wonderful descriptions . words phrases events and experiences.Danerys really is kind of stupid naive Bram may really be a tree and You Know nothing Jon Snow . ",3
"Took me a long time to get into this one because so many stories were going on I 'd lose track of who was who . Eventually got into it and hope next one does n't take long to arrive on Kindle . ",2
"The stories continue Martin 's complex world characters and the interwoven story lines all conspire to keep the reader happily engaged . I was held captive by the reading experience . ",4
"Like so many people I loved the first three books and read them quickly . I could accept that some of the characters that I had identified with were killed because the plot continued to engage meThis last book I struggled with it seemed to spend all its time journeying to somewhere and did not have enough plot movement to engage me . The descriptions of a characters breakfast the extent that they can piss types of turtles can be accepted once but not repeatedly I kept thinking that I had read all this before and so started skipping pages . I put the book down a third of the way through and after a week or two forced myself to finish but was dissapointed . I had preordered this book I will not be reading the next . ",0
"Look there are lots of jaded people leaving poopy reviews for A Dance with Dragons . That 's their right . But George R.R . Martin has written five incredible books with some of the most engrossing fascinating and despicable characters ever created . His villains are the vilest . His heros and heroines often get murdered . You grow to care about what happens next to a character and the character meets some foul end . Others persevere despite the fact they probably do n't deserve to draw another breath.I strongly recommend you buy the whole series . You 'll finish it and you 'll care about the story . You 'll care because it 's a well crafted tale of magnificent scope and spellbinding detail . I have no idea what tool the guy is using to keep track of everything but that in and of itself must be a nightmare to manage . Martin must live in the dwarf 's head and have a bird 's eye view down into Cersei 's oft exposed nether regions . This is certainly not The Hobbit . The Song of Ice and Fire contains a great deal of sexual content so it 's for mature audiences although personally the slavery and constant murderous schemes should be more troubling than the lechery.Want engrossing characters ? Got it . Want family feuds that end in mass murders and open war ? Got it . Want undead zombie hordes threatening to overwhelm the realm ? Got it ! Martin has packed a little something in for everyone . If you like your high fantasy without any salubrious glossing over of the wretched realities of living under petty kings then A Song of Fire and Ice is a great series . Yes Book Five fails to resolve many disputed issues . Yes Book Five leaves the reader without a clear idea of who will rule in Westeros . That 's fine you 'll want to buy Book Six . Worth every penny . ",4
"Can not get much better than George R.R . Martin . So detailed and unbelievably addictive . A must read for anyone who has n't watched the show yet . ",4
"I have seen a decent amount of reviews criticizing this book for not progressing the story fast enough . I have to say though I have enjoyed ADWD just as much as the previous books in the series . I am a little ticked that I have to wait 3 years to read the next book though But that is just a testament to how well the series is written . ",4
"Seriously whenever Martin runs out of ideas another Stark must die . At least that 's how it seems but since we likely wont know the outcome of that particular scenario within this book for the next 5 to 10 years while we wait for book six i simply make this plea to G.M . while he writes lol.Anyway this was definitely better than a Feast for Crows but was not on par with the first three books in my opinion . It feels like he waited too long to write this and there was a bit of broken continuity and a rush to resolve things . For example he spends A LOT of time in Winterfell but at the end he glosses over what would seem to be some very important events by simply having a letter sent via crow basically detailing the situation . I think the time between books worked against MArtin.Anyway there are more than a thousand reviews here already but i just thought i would put my own take out there . It wasnt a horrible book but it also didnt wow me . Since it is over 1000 pages you would think it would be a bit more gripping . I dont know what has happened with the series but it is dragging its feet right now.You 're obviously going to read this book but there isnt really any hurry and for me at least it was a three star area . Just okay . ",2
"I have this book on my iPad and have not completed reading it . So far it continues the saga and having it on my iPad is a very convenient way to carry the book . ",3
"What started out as a seemingly great new epic fantasy more than 10 years ago now has become something akin to the Star Wars prequels . Just an unmitigated disaster . The series did have problems from the start but they were originally outweighed by the positives GRR Martin 's writing ability and his imagination . Sadly slowly the problems have overcome anything that was once good about this story.The story has many different points of view that change disappear and reappear as the story churns ever on . There is plenty of smut and people can die in sudden twists and then magically come back ! yipee ! . That is the same way a soap opera works . Grr Martin is a good writer though . By the middle of this book Grr Martin 's good writing is a dead horse and the soap opera has been beating it all night and all morning imagine a morning that lasts several days oh wow man . The horse is just basically a red smear on the ground . The Dany chapters literally vomit out a never ending list of bizarre names and forgettable characters . Does anyone truly feel like they know these characters beyond a sorta pikachu card like depth ? While this list of characters scrolls through instead of feeling as if this is part of some grand story we feel confined to a small and boring court . While on the other hand every freaking meal is described in detail . The sex scenes are creepy smut from a man who is not experienced with women . Asha is so hollywood badgirrrl it makes me want to puke . What a boring and flat character . Not to mention completely useless . Some characters have shown some growth which is quite the feat for just a couple thousand pages ! Sansa learned how to care about others and scheme . Oh but she disappeared a couple books ago I think Oh well ! Bring in the tough bad girrrls ! Yeah she 's got a double bladed axe and knows how to use it ! She acts like the women in Martin 's favorite pornos ! His dream come true . And talk about hollywood how about the endless it'sasmallworldafterall moments Tyrion has as he meets other characters by chance ? And another 'did that character really die ? ' cliffhanger . Wow really treading some new ground there . Maybe The Bold and The Beautiful is looking for new writers ? Another battle of good vs evil within Grr Martin 's story is between his colorful imagination and his stupid ideas . One of the original ohwowman 's was the seasons lasting several years . A year is really the time for one cycle through the seasons so this sorta inside out nonsensical idea where our year which does not fit in this fantasy world is applied to their passing of time is just kinda crosseyed dumb and silly . But whatever the way it affects the fantasy is interesting and the color of the imagined is more than the stupidity of the idea . But the ideas jumped the shark with the unsullied as has been pointed out by others . Super Darwin eunuch fighters that ca n't feel anything sardaukarspartanjanissaries smashed together sans manhoods plus numbness just look at that and consider it . Wow I dunno about you but I 'm terrified . To be honest I 've always imagined these guys as comical so when the Sons of the Harpy get them I . Do n't . Care . But in this book there are n't that many new ideas . Warging is when people can control animals and is explored more . I wonder where that is going ? Hmmm . Tree humpers aka greenseers are very rare people that can hump trees and see the past . So kewl ! What a climax to Bran 's story ! Like the Force coming from intracellular bacteria ! Add to all this some thrown in lines from Monty Python 's like fart in your general direction for good measure and you have a big time hit ! Maybe Grr himself sees the whole series as a big stupid joke at this point ? He does n't really seem to care . Whatever you 'll buy it . Rated Arg for Pirate f you . ",0
"I have just started reading this latest book in the series . Story amplifies events & characters introduced in the earlier books in the series . ",4
"It may have helped that I read many negative reviews so my anticipation was low and my dread was high . In this series it is really hard to keep track of the multitude of characters . It 's a chore really . I am often confused . Even so I really enjoyed the book . I do n't mind the author 's decision to use this book to catch up on the other leading characters that were left out of the previous one . I look forward eagerly to the next installment . ",3
"The latest release from grrm in the continuing Fire and Ice series . Awesome storyline and the further developments of all the characters in the world of the Starks Lannisters Baratheons.Enjoy . ",4
"The first book in this series the actual 'Game of Thrones ' was incredibly interesting . It was a whole new world with complex and welldeveloped characters . It was a world of wonder of legend and of horror . Game of Thrones got me from its first page.Then came the second book . And I thought Meh.Then the third book . MEH.The fourth book . Oh Lord I hope the fifth is better than this ! .And the fifth bookA Dance with Dragons is one of the worst books I have EVER read in my life . More than a thousand pages long and NOTHING happens . I really do n't know what Martin was thinking when he decided to write this book.Okay after the first book we already had clues that the series was not going anywhere but one could n't help but hope that such an incredible writer would be able to produce something good after so much time.Guess what ? This book ca n't deliver.In fact when I say that NOTHING HAPPENS in this book I really mean it . The characters just wander around CLEARLY filling pages . I do n't know why would any editor publish this kind of work.I am probably not the only one but I SHALL NOT buy the other two books if they ever get released . This is simply one of the worst written works I 've had the misfortune to read.Take this from a former fan do n't waste your money on this . ",0
"More and exciting time in the world of fire ice and intrigue ! New characters and old embroiled in fascinating combat ! ",3
"I read the 5th book expecting for GRRM to start tying up some loose ends and at least begin to bring this story to an end . Not so ! This book introduces even more characters and with so many laying around now the entire army of characters each got their life 's story moved forward about one inch . At this rate GRRM will have to write about 40 Ice and Fire books to bring this saga to a close . I hope GRRM is taking good care of himself because unless he lives to be 110 or so there is no way that he does n't die before we find out which Stark is the last one standing . ",3
"I have to lay the blame on my 21 year old granddaughter who has been hooked on the books and the TV series since inception . She finally persuaded me to take interest by giving me the first book to read . It was all downhill from there next I had to read book 2 and so on.As I write this review I am midway through book five and horror there are no more books finished.Seriously the books are huge and take time to read but very entertaining and no doubt will be something that I will return to over and over . All of the best books need repeated reading in order to capture the small things that are missed on the first time reading and these books certainly fall into that category.You can not read this book without reading all of the earlier books first otherwise the intricate plot and characters will mean nothing . ",4
"Loved it and all the other books by George R R Martin . It is story that has so many fasinating characters . ",4
"I thought of this book as an improvement over A Feast for Crows and a return to form . On the downside I boggle that he is still adding new characters and how can he possibly live long enough to finish this series at the glacial pace at which he writes ? ",4
"I was glued to every word of the first 3 books in the series . With Feast and Dance I found myself rarely captivated.In fact to make it through both of these books I had to do the following in each chapter1 . Read the first few pages until the author starts rambling . The rambling usually consists ofpainfully meticulous descriptions of places and food long internal reveries of scenes fromthe prior books or lengthy introductions of new characters both minor and boring.2 . Skip to the last paragraph in the chapter and capture what I need as the plot inches sluggishly forward.I 'm not accustomed to suffering through books in this way especially when it comes to pleasure reading.If I find myself doing the same in the next book I 'm giving up the series sooner rather than later ",2
"I was a big fan of the previous books but this is just a tedious boring read . I found myself wishing for it to be over . Fans waited six years for this ? ",1
"I 've read the four previous books and liked them a lot . I had put off reading this one after reading some reviews that suggested it was slower than the previous . However I found it quite enjoyable and could n't put it down . However My biggest complaint is the overwhelming number of characters and houses etc which make it difficult to keep track of who is what . So I found myself skimming sections that I did n't care about or details that I felt were too boring . But certain characters caught my interest and I wanted to see what would happen next . I am looking forward to the next installment . ",3
"I do n't want to finish thiswaiting for the next one ! My faves are back in this fifth book and he never fails to entertain me and keep me surprised . ",4
"In this long awaited novel that runs in a partially parallel timeline to A Feast For Crows the reader learns what has been going on with Jon Snow at the wall and Daenerys Targaryen and her dragons as well as the whereabouts of Tyrion Lannister who vanished after he murdered his father . From there the storyline rejoins the full cast of characters and continues on.For me this was the best book since A Game of Thrones which is still the best one . I loved that Daenerys Jon Snow and Tyrion had many chapters as I find them to be the most interesting characters although I found Dany indecisive and a bit tedious in this novel . The plots move forward a bit in each location giving some hope that the story might actually conclude one day ! One complaint I have is that the cast of characters is growing so large it is hard to keep all the storylines straight but once you just relax and get into the story it is a fairly minor issue . I am now joining the anxious hordes waiting for The Winds of Winter . ",4
"I loved this book ! It did n't hit on a lot of the main characters except for Arya but it filled in a lot of blanks . It was a little disconcerting going back wards in the timeline but you got used to it as you read . This book is a great placeholder for the books to come and left me wanting more More MORE ! ! ! ",4
"The premise of the series is great as are the first 4 books but the 5th was a lot of redundancy with sparse dialogue and rambling descriptions of every meal random character and environ . When I got to 85 % and there was no resolution in sight I was disappointed to say the least . It appears the author is milking this story for all it 's worth . Way too many characters and even more seem to pop up at random . Too many twists to the point of chaos and the characters seem to be all over the planet . There is no sense of time passage or continuity to the flow of events . Also it seems that everyone ` s dreams have to be included in the storyline at some point . I will probably read book 6 but if it 's more off the same and does n't end I 'm done . ",1
"After reading this latest book I still have no idea what has happened to Sansa Arya Jamie or the various wolves . I guess I will create my own ending.In my conclusion Jon Snow will recover and go on to save the Starks and reunite the remaining dire wolves . ",1
"I finally finished the book and while I have to admit there are a few great television moments my overaall reaction is Meh.This book was slightly better than the last one although I liked the last one a lot more on a second reading but I agree with all the people who feel that Martin is dragging this out . It would be easier to not worry about it were it not for the fact that it will be another fifteen years minimum before we finally get the finale.And whatever enjoyment I was getting from reading was frequently interrupted by my need to quell my rage over Martin 's constant usage of the phrase much and more or little and less . It is a cute phrase used once but when it pops up every third paragraph it gets seriously irritating . It is a stupid and lazy literary quirk that Martin ought to fix . And any editor worth his salt ought to have called him on it . Of course it does not destroy the book . The book is still quite enjoyable.I am getting a bit tired of Martin 's shtick too . Oh look who just got stabbed . Sigh . I bet HE wo n't get resurrected ala Dondarrion.The book is worth a read but in the end it just made me sad . ",2
"This book is a bit confusing because its storyline is parallel to Book # 4 A Feast for Crows . The book narrows down the storyline supposedly to focus on a handful of major characters . Unfortuantely the number of minor characters once again grows and becomes an annoying distraction . It really is a shame because I enjoy the overall storyline . ",2
"I like it but it did n't resolve enough from previous books . There are too many characters to keep track of and too many details that bog down the reader . It 's annoying . ",3
"Picking up were Martin left off we get the second half of the story as the north is covered in snow and the west with blood . Martin keeps you hooked ",3
"Loved it was great . As always he is a wonderful story teller and competely wraps you up in his imagations ! His charactors are so believable and you become so ingrossed in the story its like you are really there . Love his work ! ",4
"The books of The Game of Thrones series the basis for the HBO show are probably the finest book series I have ever read . Individually and together they form some of the greatest storytelling in the world . These are not to be missed books . If you are a fan of the series then these books are a must read . ",4
"While I 'm an avid fan of Game of Thrones the fifth book A Dance with Dragons seemed to yield to the male reader more with some much detail in battles and wounds and male machinations that at times I found myself falling asleep reading . I did enjoy the whole series and would urge anyone who had read one book to continue and read the complete series . No spoilers alerts but be prepared to learn a lot about battles and war mongering . ",3
"I have had this book for many months and simply can not finish it . I used to make it a point of honor to finish every book that I started and this one is more than I can do . The first three books were great hooked me on the story lines and characters and made me glad there was more to come . I found the 4th which I was able to just barely finish and now this 5th in the series to be very disappointing.To call this author The American Tolkien is undeserved . Both series are weighty complex and deep but Martin 's has become simply shallow repetitious disjointed and boring . It 's a shame really because it started out with such promise . I do n't believe it will stand the test of time like The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings have done.I have enjoyed the first book 's HBO adaption and am looking forward to next season . However just like with the books I find I skim over fast forward the sex scenes which have become soft porn and frankly boring.I wo n't buy the subsequent books if they are ever published hot off the presses like I have previously until I know they are worth the read . ",0
"I find myself terribly ambivalent about this book . Martin has a clear writing style has created a fascinating world and juggles the various plots subplots and subsubplots admirably . His characters are compelling and 3dimensional . At the same time so what ? This series has become a death march literally as unlovely characters challenge and kill off each other . Martin 's willingness to kill off even beloved characters began as both shocking and refreshing making the story unpredictable and realistic . Now however as the body count mounts it just seems to be a death slog.And for what ? What is the meaning of this series ? Or is this a book simply a cross between existential fatalism and the demands of the commercial publishing machine . Have we actually learned anything about life people or purpose ? Or will this become the circle of time a universe existing to continue existing ? I hold out hope . Seeing Jon Snow beginning to reflect the values of Eddard Stark if you do n't see where just go back to the first volume chapter 1 indicates that perhaps someone in the series seeks to rise above the gore . I will eventually wade through this volume . It will however be my last whether or not the story finishes . ",2
"The first three books were great . They moved and I could n't put them down . Book four was a disappointment slow pace and not a thing about DT who was one of the most interesting characters . Dances With Dragons is a disingenuous titlenot much DT here either and not much about dragons either . I had anticipated this book with high hopes only to be sorely disappointed and the only thing draggin ' was the pace . If the next one takes years I 'm not sure I 'll remember to read it . ",0
"A Dance with Dragonsobviously written by a very proficient author with no urge to get to the story . There is not a single climax in the entire book . There is building action with every chapter just to disappoint you when you find yourself back at the bottom of the mountain as the next chapter begins . Overall I was disappointed in George R.R . Martin for leaving us for several years without conclusion only to give us sufficient jockeying politics and character positioning to make Jordan and Tolkien 's tales look like a haiku.Tighten up the story throw in some crescendo on occasion and please do n't make us wait another 5 years for the sequel . ",2
"Why has this book been highly rated by national critics ? The answer is because George RR Martin continues to astound us with his world building . And that is what critics love . They want a book immersed in the minute details they want to be able to imagine themselves in the book . They want to smell the smells eat the food and watch the sights . And this book delivers that in droves . Add a dash of oppressiveness and this book becomes an instant classic amongst the criticatti.This is also precisely the reason I hate this book . There is too much detail and this is not what I as a fan do not want to read . Is this a food guide or fantasy fiction ? I would rather watch the Food Network than read about the excrutiating details of each meal . Is this a travelogue or fantasy fiction ? I would rather buy Fromer 's guide to Westeros than read about the boring nature of traveling from one place to the next where nothing important happens in between.As a result we get hundreds of pages of filler . It delights the critics but it bores the heck out of me . I do n't care where whores go nor do I care to read about urinating into rivers.Admittedly the action picks up 75 % into the book and the last quarter of this book is actually readable . However this means that 250 pages is actually fairly good and the remaining 700 pages could have been cut out without impacting the book.The saddest part of this is that we will need to wait another five years for Gorge RR Martin to write the next installment of the foods that he dreams about.As a huge fan of this series hey I have not only the boardgame but the expansion for it ! I 'm sad to say that if this were book one I would not have read book two . ",0
"I jumped into this series with both feet after season one of Game of Thrones ended.I really do n't have much to say other thanif your a fan of the booksthe show does an amazing job of adhering to the books.Its fun to watch and read along to see what the show does with the books from season to season .

"I can not wait for the next book . this has been an amaing story the cliffhangers are amasing Im expectin an epic 6th and 7th book . The Winter is Coming ",4

"ADWD AwardsMost engaging chapters TyrionMost events JonMost satisfying story arc Theon and Asha GreyjoyMost progression BranMost confused convoluted complex Dany Quentyn Selmy Tyrion VictarionMost boring Dany and TyrionPointless The Watcher & MelisandreUnsatisfying Everything except the Greyjoys..Reason for my awards review ? 'Cause I 'm opposite of impressed w ADWD . I was anticipating ASOSmaterial from the positive early reviews but besides a couple of Tyrion chapters I found this book yet another metaphorical chapter to a genre chockfull of bloated epic fantasy storytelling . I was expecting ASOS events yet I was sadly disappointed by AFFC meanderings . Since this book parallels AFFC in many respects I suppose it only fitting that the book suffers from similar failures in progress resolution and satisfaction . I would like to put my official stamp of disapproval on this series which has deteriorated drastically from a stellar third book A STORM OF SWORDS . In A STORM OF SWORDS one shocking event after another seemed to move the book at a torrid pace . In A FEAST FOR CROWS and A DANCE WITH DRAGONS I was hard pressed to find events much less any movement to the novel . In spite of it all this book fares better than A FEAST FOR CROWS a lot better . Sadly that 's not saying much.Unlike its predecessors even if we were to take AFFC and ADWD together there exists so few resolutions to any existing plots that the two latest novels can not possibly stand on their own . Unlike its predecessors AFFC and ADWD feel like bridge novels nothing is resolved in a satisfying manner and more questions and plot tangents arise instead . Unlike his first three novels none of the story arcs in AFFC and ADWD with the possible exception of the Greyjoy story arc contained endings unto themselves and yet left the reader wanting more.1 .

"I try not to write reviews of books I don & # 8217t like . I have before but not often . However I found George R.R . Martin & # 8217s & # 8220A Dance With Dragons & # 8221 so disappointing and so irritating that I had to write something down . I can understand that perhaps part of my disappointment came from the fact that the & # 8220good guys & # 8221 in his novels can & # 8217t buy a break death misery bad luck and stupidity simply plague them . But I get the feeling that the author is using the & # 8220shock factor & # 8221 of this to sell novels at the expense of writing a good story . At every turn the good guys or maybe you could call them the best of the bad guys either screw it up for themselves the bad guys screw it up for them or fate just appears to have it in for them.But what really gets me about this book is the story itself . Such potential after the first three novels but so many words are wasted here and in A Feast of Crows . Paragraph after paragraph and page after page they don & # 8217t add to the story or to the characters . They & # 8217re just words and more words seemingly for the sake of drawing out an eventual climax . There & # 8217s dialogue that doesn & # 8217t matter and events that don & # 8217t add anything to the story or move it along . And to be clear In the last two novels there are very few events at all and certainly nothing approaching a climax.I & # 8217m extremely disappointed in the apparent way the battle with Stannis and the Boltens & # 8220appears & # 8221 to have played out . I say & # 8220appears & # 8221 because with this author you just don & # 8217t know But the event that I & # 8217d guess everyone reading this novel waited for with baited breath ? We read nothing of it . What happened with Stannis and Winterfell is covered by about 50 words & # 8211 IN A LETTER TO JON SNOW FROM RAMSEY BOLTEN ? ! ? ! ? ! Are you kidding me ? This is horrendous storytelling ! Such a slap in the face to readers.I & # 8217m guessing this is all an attempt to drag out an ending . Maybe for the purpose of selling books maybe for the television folks at HBO . But regardless of how the final two novels of this series play out A Feast of Crows and A Dance With Dragons could & # 8217ve been combined into one fairly short novel . Nothing happens for heaven & # 8217s sake.I & # 8217m sorry . I like the world of Westeros . I can even deal with the good guys losing sometimes . That & # 8217s life . But Mr. Martin tries too hard . Ned loses his head . Rob and Catelyn get sliced . Sansa abused . Bran crippled and wondering homeless in the north . No one seems to know where Rickon even is . And Arya ? Misery from the first and besides I don & # 8217t get her storyline at all . Now Jon . He doesn & # 8217t even have the Stark name but gets the shaft literally just the same.Okay . I & # 8217ve said enough . The story here in my humble opinion sucks to high heaven . I & # 8217m offended by the author & # 8217s callous unconcern for me his reader . Or I & # 8217m mad at myself for even reading . If I hadn & # 8217t enjoyed the first three novels in the series I would & # 8217ve quit A Feast of Crows half way through and never would & # 8217ve moved on to A Dance With Dragons . Dragons which by the way spend the entire novel out of mind and out of sight . Oh and did I mention there & # 8217s another Targaryin in the picture not Daenerys who we & # 8217ve followed for five books but at least one & # 8211 if not two & # 8211 more whom we were lead to believe were dead ! .It & # 8217s unlikely I read the final two books in this series . And I will be terminating my Sunday evening viewing of HBO & # 8217s Game of Thrones . I know where it & # 8217s going and I don & # 8217t like it . However the lack of actual action and events in the books should make it easier for the TV series to cover everything . After all nothing is really happening that we need to see to know where things are going ! SPOILER Here & # 8217s how bad it is Even the good Uncle Kevan Lannister appears to bite the dust a victim to Mr. Martin & # 8217s need to put killing ahead of storytelling . One good thing about all of the good guys dying and probably the only reason I would even consider coming back for the last two books soon the author will have to start killing bad guys ! There & # 8217s hardly anyone else left ! A Feast of Crows and A Dance With Dragons Two of the worst books I & # 8217ve ever read and many wasted hours of my life I & # 8217ll never get back.Goodbye Westeros . So long Song of Fire and Ice !

"I could not put it down yet wondered why . After reading his first four books I learned not to to get invested in characters . Martin 's way of creating surprises seems to be to kill off characters at a brisk pace . The world he has created is diverse and difficult to follow at times . Perhaps . because this book run parallel with the previous book it seemed as if the author is cleaning up loose ends as times.Over all if you liked the first four books you 'll like this one . ",3
"This latest installment does not live up to the previous books . Although there are some interesting parts another reviewer got it pretty much on the mark1000 pages of not much happening . I have read all of the other books in the series and they are all spectacular but this book falls completely flat . Not sure what is going on here how could there be a difference between this book and the others in the series ? Did GRRM run out of any new ideas for the series and is just now writing just for the money . Unfortunately I have seen this before..writers of epic fantasies sometimes just keep the series going for too long . It has been a long time since I was this bored reading not sure I will get the next installment . ",1
"Like many I came to this series when HBO premiered A Game of Thrones.I 'm disappointed for 2 reasons1 . I bought this book for $ 14.95 for my Kindle I thought I 'd save money with a Kindle you know ? .2 . This book ENDED WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE BEGUN ! I will not read GRRM anymore cuz he ai n't getting anymore of my time nor hard earned money . ",0
"As one of GRRM 's first and diehard fansI have recommended this series far and wide even going so far to tell people the wait was worth it which was harder after Feast but I pressed doggedly on . Now with a week 's worth of sore wrists and neck maybe the Kindle really is a good idea I 'm sadly disappointed . I have a vision of the HBO producers sitting around a table drinking heavily and wondering what they 're going to do should they make it to Season 4 contemplating hemlock hitmen and making a deal with the screenwriters.I wo n't go into many details everyone has already done a masterful job of that great reviews but the main points are worth repeating characters left out characters cliffhanging characters introduced that end in pointless wanderings characters that we care about pointlessly wandering Brienne Jaime Rickon Catelynn Arya Bran ? ? hundreds of pages wasted on sailing marchingand food . The sturdy rope that held this series together is unraveling so fast and has so many loose ends it 's as if a Westerosi wind knocked over GRRM 's box of index cards and he has them hopelessly mixed up . Oh and editingif I never hear I 'm just a young girl who does n't know the ways of the world again I 'll die happy . More like I 'm just a young girl who wandered through 959 pages and forgot what she was doing describes our oncevibrant Dany.The real frosting on this soggy cake was GRRM 's Acknowledgement at the end he thanked everybody he could think of except the people he should 've thanked his loyal and longsuffering readers who 've made him what he is . George take a page from Stephen King he never fails to think of us he 's gracious thoughtful and kind . After the slog through this tome you blew it big time with that lack of courtesy pal . I deserved some of that acknowledgement and so did everyone else . ",1
"I really enjoyed this most recent book in the Game of Thrones series . If you have not read any of the book you will have to start with the first and you will be in for an awesome reading experience . ",4
"Martin is a true master . His stories keep you spellbound with all of the twist and turns and the subplots . It is very difficult to put his books down . Anyone who enjoys historical fantasy will loves this book ! ",4
"Unsurprisingly given that this is merely the companion to book 4 rather than the successor this book continues to build tension as we approach the battle for Meereen across the Narrow Sea and the battle for mankind in the North with the battle for Winterfell in the mix as well ! Given the complexity of the gritty world that Martin has created the engaged reader will look for foreshadowing of what is to come . Does Melisandre give Jon the breath of life ? Does Brown Ben Plumm take Tyrion to Daenerys so that she learns more of her dragons ? Does Daenerys return to Meereen on Drogon leading a Dothraki horde ? Mr . Martin has created a vast area of possibilities that will make the reader frustrated and annoyed that heshe can not dive into Book Six and see where these threads come together . The journey has been a long one for those use to instant gratification and those who come later will never appreciate the power the author has invoked over his readership but this series must rank as one of the truly epic fantasies ever written . ",3
"On Audible . When all power goes out like in the TV series Revolution I will still have five great books to keep me company . ",4
"Story does not need to end . Hard to put these books down . wish there was less sexual content because would be a great read otherwise for teenage boys ",3
"Martin 's work has always wallowed in depression and darkness but his storytelling ability always kept me turning the pages . With A Dance of Dragons he has finally jumped the shark . Here the story bogs down in a surfeit of obscure names and places and endless minutiae while maintaining the usual level of degradation and perversion . I 'm beginning to realize that there wo n't be a satisfying let alone happy ending to this series . Why wade through thousands more pages of this mindnumbing Bataan death march when you know it will simply involve more innocents being raped tortured and murdered in nasty ways ? Why continue to read about characters you hate after all the characters you might actually care about have been whacked ? Sorry but my masochism has its limits . Life is too short . Screw you George . I 'm done . ",0
"While GRRM 's talent is still apparent in the writing style the plot is gone . You 'll feel like you 're treading water within his world when you 've become accustomed to swift pace in books 13 . The biggest tragedy is that the meandering handling of the characters . You wo n't look forward to seeing a name pop up at the top of a chapter like before . In fact you 'll likely dread some . By midway through I began to hope this book was just a vessel to finally kill off Daenerys . That hope was n't enough to justify reading the second halfThe book feels like those albums that musicians put out to get out of their label contracts . ",1
"As I begin reading A Dance with Dragons ADWD from here forward a few quick impressions are offered . These thoughts are definitely not limited to ADWD because I 'm reading the new book within the context of the first four novels which I started rereading when I knew the HBO series was to begin.Someone once said Context is king and in the case of George R.R . Martin 's epic this is especially true . A reader could find value in any single book of course but I am compelled to view ADWD as a physical volume holding only part of a body of content think of 5 or more computer hard drives containing one very detailed story.Martin 's content story must be seen as somewhat nonlinear . This will make some readers uncomfortable while others will delight in or enjoy or at least tolerate the nonlinear style.The longer the length of the content perhaps the better a somewhat jumpy or distemporal style serves . I for one find GRRM 's leaps and bounds which are mostly characterbased not a problem evev though they require a bit of work on the part of the reader.Having written that I must hasten tob thank Mr Martin for not using nuncle endless times and it is my hope that his nearly neurotic need to put the words sentinel and soldier next to virtually every mention of pine trees will come to an end now and forever ! Search for yourself if you need this point validated.Repeating phrases is not sin and I only poke fun lightly dear sir.Some of the rather predictable spellings alliteration in character namestitles and the still rather odd to my ear anyway usages such as arse for ass are cultural or just the little tics of a great and weathered nuncle storyteller . I honestly believe that George Martin is doing astounding work in scope at least far beyond Tolkien.ADWD has some burps and stumbles and my Lord what else could be expected ? This serves to make both story and writer all the more human and the reader perhaps more human too if human is rightly related to humus humility.HBO can not do the story justice though they do try . And if Tyrion were my brother I would call myself blessed . And if Cerci or Lysa or most of the female characters were my kin I 'd walk the earth shamefaced . I 'd dye my beard blue . ",3
"I thought this would be the final volume but it seems it 's going to stretch on forever which would n't be bad if the readers did n't have to wait forever for Winds of Winter and a Dream of Spring . Hopefully the HBO cash will push him into a more productive mode . ",2
"I 'll be quick about this . Is it a fun read ? In some ways yes . On a pagebypage basis Martin is as good an author as you 're likely to ever find in this genre.HOWEVER . Books and this may be even more true for long serial stories need a cohesive structure that allows the storyline to develop to grow and then to eventually reach climax and resolution . It 's very similar to music composition . Readers can only absorb so many plot threads and deepening complexities and left turns into new subplots before the work becomes a tiresome mess . Martin has crossed that line.He may be able to salvage this series but it will mean getting back on track and starting to bring the critical plot threads together into some semblance of a cohesive story arc that builds momentum towards a finish . And it does n't matter to me how many books that takes . But this reader will not be purchasing another in this series without some assurance that Martin is willing and capable of delivering the goods . ",1
"I finally got through the last book . I 've been reading a couple chapters before sleep every night . They 've been like mini character portraits . Enjoyable but most do n't seem to have anything do with the other chapters . I feel a little empty despite the one thousand pages . I 've been left hangingfar too many loose ends and no real climactic finish.There are already some great twostar reviews here that capture how I feel about this book and the fourth one . Disappointed mostly . I began to notice a lot of repetitive prose must needs nipples on a breastplate etc . and that 's a sign to me that the actual story was n't really holding my interest.Why does n't George outline his stories better ? He could have ended both Feast for Crows and this book on climactic scenes if he had . And trimmed out the bloat . He badly needs an editor . ",1
"I enjoyed reading this volume and appreciate the level of detail GRRM is putting into his story . This book is a good holiday read as it is easy to read in bite sized pieces . ",3
"Apologists for the sadism that pervades this series say that its purpose is to upend the myth of the courtly ideal showing us the vicious collateral consequences for the silent majority of unceasing wars for power . If this were actually the author 's goal one would expect the silent majority to play more than a bit role in this morality tale there might be some tears shed for example for the two miller 's sons whose heads are chopped off as a ruse to substitute for the two aristocratic children Bran and Rickon . But no those nameless children are only archetypes not real people with whom we might empathize . Running counter to the apologists is the author 's underlying reactionary idea that there is something special and unique about the blood of kings . Some genetic difference between kings and lords on the one hand and the peasants on the other cause the entire population other than the wildlings as well as the author to obsess about legitimacy and bloodlines . The fact that this is real in the author 's mind is evident from the fact that Daenerys with the blood of the dragon running in her princess veins is the only one who can hatch and tame dragons and the Stark children with the blood of the First Men in their veins are among the very few who can enter into the minds of other beings and take on their perspectives . Moreover it is only a sacrifice from the blood of kings that can appease the red god and bring forth demons to do his bidding.So what is the justification for the cannibalism the voyeurism the sadistic tortures the tongues ripped out the skin flayed the hands fingers and toes cut off the eyes gouged out the burnings alive the hangings the beheadings the slit throats the cheeks bit off and on and on ? I submit that the author gets some frisson of pleasure from these and he knows full well how to play to the baser instincts of his audience . Why are we allowing this author to play to our worst instincts in this way ? And why are n't we asking why ? Beyond the sadism is the clear and pervasive misogyny of the series . The author is obsessed with whores and as the series has progressed he seems to have multiplied his references to prostitutes and whorehouses so that there is a reference practically every page in the fifth book . The author further denigrates women by having even the heroic characters patronizingly refer to any woman as a sweetling as if their only purpose is to present themselves as a sweet thing to men an irritating trope that occurs hundreds of times . The women characters themselves fall into three stereotyped categories the evil the dumb and the ones who manage to figure out how to behave like men and it 's only the third category who carry any real interest.This series is obviously immensely popular but consider whether it is so in part because of an appeal to our worst instincts and to our most reactionary views about some natural and hereditary aristocracy . These sorts of ideas when unquestioned tend to have an insidious effect on the way we think . It 's especially concerning to see these books showing up again and again on teens ' favorite series lists . ",1
"This is a much better book and a much better series than plenty of other stuff out there . It is gripping you feel for the characters and you really enjoy the ride . I could n't put it down . That being said it is true that he takes to long to write them and that it is horrible to fear that he may not finish the series . It is also true that there are no great breakthroughs in Book 5 . ",4
"So far there is no dancing going on . All the characters have become ones with no brain and not a thought before the stupidity . I have this book on kindle and have fast forwarded chapter after chapter . He writes about characters that I could give a flying flip for and only writes a little about whom I would think was the main characters . What is sad it has ruined the series on HBO for me as well . Why kill off so many of the main characters ? Who cares what color every single person is wearing or every detail of all their ancestors ? It 's liking reading history books in school except I paid for the book . Man and all the very detailed facts of the tortures . I wont be buying anymore of the books in this series what would the point be ? I think he got high and kinda wondered off . ",1
"Well written involving and complex history which is of a fantastical nature but nevertheless engrossing . Do not expect the usual outcomes or resolution . This may make it hard to read at times but more like reality than not . ",3
"I promised myself I would not review anything that already had more than 100 reviews only a megalomaniac would bother throwing his two cents into an overflowing piggy bank . But I am writing this review and I justify it but trying to address those who are considering reading SOIAF1 . But you have n't read any of the books and you want to know if it is worth starting.2 . You enjoyed HBO 's Game of Thrones and want to know if the books are as exciting.I think you should . A Dance with Dragons is the 5th book of a planned 7 book series . As such it is part of the middle chapters of the saga . Frodo will not be casting the Ring into Mount Doom in this book . A Song of Ice and Fire succeeds for me because of the individual chapters and characters . Yes I want to know what comes next but unlike some other multivolume works I am not reading the books to know the solution to the mystery . I read it for the journey . Dante would still be worth reading even if he had never finished Paradiso . This is n't Dante but it is a well told story.Dance with Dragons concentrates on the storylines dropped from A Feast for Crows DanyTyrion and Jon Snow . The latter part of the book picks up where the last volume left off and adds chapters for Cersei and Jaime . Other characters get their voices including Bran Arya Asha Greyjoy and some new perspectives as well.Much of the Seven Kingdoms is in ruin and winter really is coming at last . A sense of strained resources fills the book and many of the criticized references to food are references to how little food is left . Those lords who have not been hurt by the war become disproportionately powerful allowing some secondary families to become important players.Much of the book explores the wisdom of our familiar characters in unfamilar situations will Tyrion 's wits save him now that he is no longer a rich Imp ? Can Jon Snow succeed as the Commander of the Night 's Watch in times more perilous than any commander has known in half a hundred generations ? Now that Dany really has a throne can she keep it ? Does she want to ? These questions are all addressed in this book.The remainder of the review may contain some spoilers . Be warned.Martin 's writing is fresh as ever . I found some chapters of Feast for Crows uninteresting but ADWD held my attention throughout . That said I did get tired of Dany saying If I look back I am lost every time she made a poor decision . Jon Snow tells himself You know nothing Jon Snow as he makes one intelligent choice after another . Words are wind you tell yourself after a while . Tyrion Jon and Dany all act rashly in Dany 's case more often than not . Bran finds his destiny and so perhaps does Arya.The scope of the book expands we travel down the Rhoyne spend time in Volantis and get to know more about the cities of Slaver 's Bay.Enjoyment of any book is subjective and far be it from me to disagree with anyone else 's view but a lot of the criticism seems to fall into one of several categories1 . I do n't want to wait for the end give it to me now.2 . I want to see the last battle . I got burned by Robert Jordan and it wo n't happen again.3 This story is simply too long . I 'm interested in insert favorite character here and the rest is a waste of time.4 . Everybody else is trashing it and I do n't want to seem out of step.5 . My favorite characters do stupid things and it annoys me.I am sympathetic to all of these complaints . I 've had twinges of 3 length bits of 2Dragons fight NOW please and a severe bout of 5 Khaleesi can not make up her mind it is known . But I think the book survives all of these criticisms . I also believe that this book and the last were necessary to set the characters up for the final conflicts . I expect the next book may we see it in our lifetimesto get better reviews . ",4
"Bore me once shame on you bore me twice I 'm an idiot . I refuse to a pay the exorbitant eBook price for Dragons b get sucker punched again by hundreds and hundreds of pages of blathering meandering exercises in howlongcanIstretchoutnothingwhatsoeverhappening and c waste precious and nonrefundable hours of my life stuck in a book written by an author who has utterly lost his passion for his own story AND any respect for his clamoring fans . He does n't care about shortchanging his readers I certainly do n't care to fork over money to help him do so . ",0
"As with any series like this you either like it or you do n't . I find it very addictive particularly because there are so many characters for which George R.R . Martin has fleshed out different personalities and interactions . If you try to figure out where things are going you will usually be wrong.I 've been reading this during chemo treatments . I find that it really helps with the mental aspect of dealing with cancer . ",4
"This book is great ! I would recommend it to anyone . I thoroughly enjoyed it and it was so hard to put down . ",4
"This book seems to have gotten the same negative reviews as Feast for Crows and I do n't really know why . I thought it was great ! It was n't quite as awesome as the first couple books but it still had me not wanting to put it down . Yes there were a ton of cliffhangers and the book did n't end really resolved on anything but we should be used to that it 's just his writing style . I agree with some of the people that there were a couple chapters that should have been left for the next book mainly Cersei and Jamie because they did n't really add anything to this story but that does n't make it a bad book . It was exciting a lot happened and it is n't always what was expected . Some new character perspectives like Barristan Asha Melisandre and Quentyn added to the variety and it was nice to see things from some new perspectives . I enjoyed reading this book and while I do n't look forward to the wait for the next book I am excited for the book itself . ",4
"I enjoyed these books three and four lagged a bit to me but the pace picks up again in book five . Really book one is the best . Not great literature for sure but entertaining and something to do at 3am when you ca n't sleep . If you enjoy dragons tree spirits and little people well spiced with some graphic violence and a bit of sexy stuff you will probably like this series . ",3
"I must confess that I really enjoyed the first three books of this series . I was disappointed with this book as well as its predecessor . They were mostly filler and history lessons . I kept reading this book because I was attached to Snow The only main character with a sense of honor . After I finished it I regretted deeply the hours of my life that were wasted on book that did n't deserve them . This book feels more like a horror flick crude and pointless violence with no depth . ",0
"then read something great like War and Peace.This is worse than a steaming pile of you know what it is a long steaming pile of you know what . The smell stays with you long after you 've finished it.Like others have said I loved the first 3 books . Then AFFC was terrible . I did n't know if anything else could be quite as bad but now this might be even worse.I 'm done with the series . There are a million great books out there waiting to be read . ",0
"Please Mr. Martin Finish this series ! ! ! ! ! Serious cliffhangers after 800 pages of reading are just pure torture.Ca n't wait for the next one ! ",3
"I have run quickly through all five books and like other readers had hoped that there would be some progression to an end . But no . So many points of view now IMHO . I sense that the author is working harder and harder to get through each successive book and may not yet have sight of what the ending should be unlike JK Rowling who evidently wrote out all the outlines for all the Harry Potter books before she started . Despite this the author turns a great tale and wraps you up in it . Have to admire how he tracsk all the POVs locales and players . ",3
"This book brings together many story lines and progresses them . The ending is great . Might be my favorite in the series so far it is a toss up with the third book . Only problem I have with it is when I finished I wanted to read the next one . I can not wait for the sixth book to come out . ",4
"A Dance with Dragons A Song of Ice and Fire Book 5I bought this book kindle edition because I read the previous 4 books and I wanted to find out how the story progresses . Given all the loose ends I suspect the author will publish several more books before he will deem necessary to present us with the conclusion of this epic soap opera . Overall I found this book less enjoyable than the previous ones . At times the pace of the narrative slows to a crawl and the author seems to take a questionable pleasure in his detailed glorification of total human degradation . Some of the characters tend to become increasingly inconsistent for example Jamie Lannister seems to discover some latent sense of honor the Ironmen appear increasingly like a time dislocated version of the Viking raiders and Braavos looks like a mixture of Venice and the ancient Greek port of Rhodes where the Colossus straddling its entrance has now become a gigantic statue named after deities of the Greek mythology i.e . the Titans . I missed the part where Greek mythology was taught in the Free Cities but I keep wandering why the author went through the trouble of creating such imaginative new geography obviously the planet this story takes place is not our good old Earth but kept the same moon which scientists tell us is an anomaly in our solar system . However I will not question the ability of the Wall to stand for thousands of years in the same place and not becoming a moving glacier especially when it goes up and down hills because I know the answer it is the embedded magic . Finally I was disappointed with the change of the very likable and assertive character of Daenerys into a woman who thinks more with what she has between her legs than between her ears . ",2
"So indepth . Loved and hated that there were so many characters and so many points of view . I was left with a sense of excitement anticipation and mistrust on so many levels . I hope the next book makes it all worth it . ",3
"I read this book with great enthusiasm . A great ending to a great series but so sad to see it end . Another amazing author . ",4
"Yes it 's overly long and descriptive and does n't look like it can possibly wrapped any time soon . But I saw those flaws in the first three books as well and it already seemed to me in Sword of Storms that Martin was just piling up events but not actually heading toward fixing or resolving some of the events even though that book was better written in general . So I had lowered expectations for this book . I liked several of the storylines Jon Theon Bran Asha even though I agree with the general sentiment that half of it could have been chopped off . ",2
"We Your loving and concerned fans want the good stuff back ! Give us the good old action packed song of ice and fire we so loved and got addicted to for the first 3 installment ! Are you Robert Jordan Master of BORE Or the acclaimed GRR Martin creator of worlds master of intrigue emperor of suspense ? If you read most of the reviews here you 'll find all the reviewers say the same things a very very long book with almost no plot.Boring . Tedious . superfluous . Are those the words you want to be associated with your creation ? What started out as one of the most thrilling exiting and enjoyable fantasy series took a dive down leaving millions of fans bitterly disappointed . We want to be able to read on and see what happens . lead us through this epic tale you created make us again love and hate cry and lough and read with wonder what magnificent and thrilling adventures are installed for your characters . Do not let it end this way.Make Feast for crows and Dance of dragons just a bad dream you woke from and write us the book we are waiting for.Join me in telling Mr. Martin to deliver the goods Do not buy this book . Nothing much happens there you are not missing out.If you must read it borrow it from a library or from someone who waisted his money already . Resist the urge to buy I know it is difficult sometimes but it will serve a good cause . Maybe if the sales of this book will be considerably lower Mr. Martin will understand that he has let down his fans and that he needs to give them the terrific sixth installment they are waiting for.I am not a crazed fun . I can go on with my life with or without the 7 kingdoms but a decent sequel and a worthy ENDING would be nice too.I mean I love an epic saga but how long can it go ? Do n't the devoted readers deserve a closure ? It appears to me that Mr. Martin does not seem to think so . Maybe he does not have a clue as how to end it or maybe he thinks we are walking talking ATM machines.If he does intend to end it with the brilliance and magic he knows to weave let it happen now . If this is the best he can do Why would you give him your money ? How can a book this disappointing that has made so may people give up entirely on the series be on the best sellers list ? I have posted this exact same reviewprotest for GRRM 's Feast for crows . In my opinion these two books are basically the same long endless less than mediocre book That should not have been written . The two were just too thick to bind together and I guess that making the readers pay for two bad books instead of just one appealed to Mr. Martin and his publisher . ",0
"I have read books two through five and without a doubt this book is the worst of the series.Dany T. become a confused teenage girl after leading successful victories in A Storm of Swords it is like her character regressed . Again though I do n't think Martin understands women like many male authors when writing to develop a female character in depth he fails.Tyrion actually is subdued and boring through out the entire book . The active and wise character of the first three books become very boring in this book but toward the end you can see the old Tyrion working to become a player in The Game of Thrones.Jon Snow actually becomes so interesting I actually went back and read his parts I skipped over in Clash of Kings and Stomr of Swords very good in fact the best part of the book . Yes we all are wondering what will become of him but if I know Martin when one hero falls another rises.I am anxiously awaiting what happens with Jaime Brienne Arya Victorian Greyjoy and Queen Cersei . I think after the Epilogue which by far is the best and most amazing part of the book all chaos is going to break loose in the very said but very cathartic Winds of Winter.Overall the book lacks any good flow it seems chalky and it is his worst written book of the series . The language is n't there the beauty of the first four books is n't there and I doubt he finishes this series . I think his passion may be gone for it and he does n't seem to be the type to finish just to finish . we shall never know what became of Westeros . . we can only imagine and that to me is the greatness of Martin . ",1
"I began to feel about halfway through the third book that this series had gotten away from GRRM he 'd killed off most of the interesting and sympathetic characters and did n't know what to do with the ones who were left . The fourth book was bad and this one is just terrible . A boring painful slog through a meandering plot endless details and tangential stories about random characters most of whom are either new to the book or so unmemorable they might as well be . I 'm imagining our author laughing hysterically about having written as bad a book as he could and still selling it . That 's the only explanation I can come up with . ",0
"I have read the first 4 books of this series . Each o ne is fantastic and this one is no exception . Each of the many characters is written about and personalities are shown . I have watched 2 seasons of Game of Thrones on HBO and although they omit a lot it is fun to see what they will do with this 5th book . ",4
"Way too long and only 100 pages worth of good stuff happens . It was a waste of time to read this ",0
"Great as always . Just cant wait for the next book to come out . I love the books even more than the series . That is usually the case though as the books hold so much more detail . ",4
"The plot does n't move it creeps in fits and starts . I enjoyed Books 13 but Books 4 & 5 are long hard slogs of Martin describing banners castles roads religions family histories boats clothing et cetera ad infinitum broken briefly and rarely with action . ",0
"As thrilling as the first 4 books . Suspense in every chapter . Ca n't wait until book 6 comes out . Author indicated on last page that there will be one soon . I hope the story line continues for at least a few more books . One gets emersed in the setting until you fee that you are actually there . Great series . ",4
"George R. R. Martin is a master story teller and a writer of tremendous talent . He develops a huge number of characters into many plots and story lines and manages to keep it all moving forward and interrelated . ",4
"The first 3 books were great the 4 th and especially this last book is a dissapointment . Martin throws in new characters and new story lines at fast pace and these new characters and storylines are just not interesting . I have read all great fantasy writers but never had the feeling before that i want to skip chapters because nothing important happens in them anyway . Even the main characters are less interesting in this last book as the storyline is always the same character x sets out to y but oh something happens so x does not succeed in y so x is doing z and oh someting happens .. Etc . The inpredictability becomes predictable almost no character in the book succeeds at a goal set out . All in all too many characters too many storylines that are not interesting too little develpment of the main story . Editors have been sleeping ",0
"Along with many other fans of this series I am disappointed with the direction this series has taken . This is easily the worst written book of the series and as far as storyline goes along with A Feast of Crows should have been edited down to peharps the first two hundred pages of a real novel one that would have have moved the series forward.I really have to wonder what the writers at HBO are going to have to do to make these books palatable for a television audience . There are so many new characters so many new viewpoints that the story has gotten completely bogged down . And Martin does n't just tell us what they are saying we have to know everything that they are thinking as well . Add to that he 's been giving us glimpses into the disatnt past of the land by sliding in snippets of ancient legends and myths that we have no reference points to or any real reason to care about anyway.At first I was glad to see that he has included the maps to the Free Cities and the lands to the East but this was shortlived . Much of the story takes place in these lands asnd so we have to have endless descriptions of the customs and food and governments of these places that just serves to take up space . A lot of space.. What it also does is take is away from the main plot in the first three novels which is Who will eventually sit on the Iron Throne of Westeros . We cared about what happened to Arya and Jon and Bran but now they are such a small part of the overall plot that they no longer seem importanat or relevant to the resolution of the main storyline.The plot what there is of one is n't very interesting and much if not all of the action takes place off stage like the battle for Winterfell . There are no surprises no stunning developments or character deaths that made the first three novels so much fun to read.One last observation . Martin seems to take perverse delight in humiliating his characters both great and small . Tyrion Sasnsa Arya Asha Theon Cersei the list goes on and on . It all began actually when Eddard agreed to allow Sasna 's dorewolf Lady be killed thus dooming her to the role of a pretty pawn . This trait has gotten much much more pronounced in this novel . So much so that several of the chapters are nearly impossible to get through without physically cringing . What this leaves us with are a group of characters so flawed so affected that we do n't have anyone left to root for . And those characters that we did care about are so far out of the mainstream that what they do ca n't possibly seem to matter anyway.By the time Martin gets to finishing Book Six of this neverending story HBO will have to hire all new actors for the televison series . Or maybe they will rewrite these last two books and edit them the way this one should have been edited in the first place . Better yet they should probably just skip it all together . ",1

"If you had told me to make a list off the top of my head before I sat down to read this novel of events I 'd want to see or resolutions I was looking for it would have been something likeDany mastering her dragons escaping the Meereen situation and heading west.Tyrion arriving at Dany 's court to serve her in his unique ways.The battle with the Others finally starting in a serious way.Jon learning who he is.Cersei 's trial and the unleashing of FrankinGregor.What is Jaime going to do ? Is Briennie dead what did she say to get out of the noose ? Quentyn arriving at Dany 's court and revealing Dorne 's plans to her.Victarion using the horn to control the dragons.Bran meeting the Greenseer and finishing his training.Arya finishing her training.A pretty obvious list based on the story so far right ? I would have been happy with 3 of these stories moving along 4 would have been downright wonderful . Instead I got one and a half . And the kickerit 's the last one and a half I would have chosen.This would have been bad enoughonly it got worse . GRRM manages to add two more very interesting plotlines one of which is Stannis ' battle for the North the other of which we 'll let be a secret and he gives no resolution for them either.This is a novel that ended 200 hundred pages short . Throughout all of it we are given two big stories the North and the East and both of them look to lead towards large power altering battles that will rival the Blackwateronly we never get to them . The book stops before BOTH.It is a novel filled with ships sailing and sailing and sailing some more . Of marching and marching and marching some more . Jon Snow becomes muddled in food stores concerned with wildlings with not an Other in sight of the wall . Dany reverts back to trying to save absolutely everyone doing anything at all to make a false peace and turns on her own dragons . Cersei has 2 chapters Jaime 1 and both of them feel like they should have either been included into AFFC or left out till Book 6 . Bran and Ayra train but it has no end in sight.Tyrion.Tyrion learns to cherish his inner dwarf . If all this does n't sound exciting do n't worry you will be lucky enough to get to read near 50 pages of food descriptions scattered about the novel . There is also about 100 You know nothing Jon Snows about 50 Words are Wind and considerable I must go forward and something about Lannister 's and debts I did n't know aboutI ca n't say it was all bad . If there was n't good I would n't be so disappointing in where the book ended after all . Reek Barristan Asha and Davos were all fantastic the single Melisandre chapter shed much light on a certain bastard 's destiny and my maindragon Drogon was the star of the book.ButI have just finished 1000 pages it is fresh in my mind and what drives me to my disappointment is the thought of another 5 yearswhere I will have my list above one scratched off and yet two more added.3.5 but it does n't deserve the curve .

"A pretty good story but I found the end lacking . Probably because I thought this was the last book . I look forward to the next one . ",3
"The series has completely run out of steam.Fair warning here be spoilers.George R.R . Martin continues to deliver excellent dialogue and sparkling prose but his terror tactic writing where he builds up a point of view character only to be cutdown in cold blood e.g . Ned Stark Rob Stark Kevin Lannister the Onion Knight the King Beyond the Wall et.al . has finally produced the result that it is nearly impossible to care about any of George 's characters . Why invest the emotional energy when the character is likely to die no matter how improbable the reason ? Neither the murder of the Onion Knight nor the murder of the King Beyond the Wall had to occur to promote the plot in DwD.The plot is soooooo plodding in DwD that you have to wonder if the purpose of the glacial pace is only to wring out another novel from a cash cow . The filler pages go on and on and on about flora and fauna.Our Dragon Queen decides to hang out across the sea when given the opportunity 13 vessels to go home and reclaim her birthright . She also cages up her dragons well the two that she and her minions can fool or capture.What ? ! ! ? While character development and change are important in great stories this particular change seemed to be a premature birth.It just makes the series drag on and on.When Tyrion falls off the side of the barge into the deadly water I actually felt relieved but since Tyrion is George 's alter ego in the series the dwarf is improbably back a few chapters later . The means of recovering the dwarf that fell down into the murky river and was essentially drowned is glossed over in the book . Of course George will just kill Tyrion off in the first chapter of the next book as a way of saying nahnahbooboo to his remaining readers.Jon Snow ends up helping out our usurper king too . Why ? Who knows ? And the god of the deep ends up being I ca n't even bear to tell you in the review it is sooooo silly.Then there is the Deus ex Machina and returned minor character at the end of the book who kills off K. Lannister . The character 's appearance is not so much a dramatic plot twist as a head scratcher . It completely destroys suspension of disbelief . Also the character who was previously portrayed as completely amoral if not actually evil now rides in on the white charger as the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.What ? ! ? ! ? Why ? ! ? ! ? Actually more to the point it is hard to even care.I understand that the HBO miniseries was very good.Hopefully if HBO gets to the point where the Feast for Crows and Dance with Dragons takes place the playwrights will take significant liberties with the story.In serviceRich ",1
"Here is the latest cliffhanger du jour from George R.R . Martin the fifth in the A Song of Ice and Fire series . Hopefully I do n't have to wait six years till the sixth bookThe Winds of Winter comes out although I have to say the wait was worth it for this novel . Many questions and mysteries from previous books are solved but a host of new puzzling chapter endings crop up . When I read this series I feel like I 'm a kid again watching the Flash Gordon serials in the movies on Saturday.This book runs parallel with A Feast for Crows up to a point . It follows the characters from the north and across the narrow sea till about page 593 when the time frame reunites both books . This book brings the reader up to date on Tyrion Daenerys King Stannis Jon Snow Bran Stark Davos Seaworth and Theon Greyjoy now called Reek . Arya Stark reenters the novel on page 593 Jaime Lannister on 632 Brienne of Tarth on 646 Cersei on 717 and Victarion Greyjoy on page 741 . Surprisingly Sansa Stark and Littlefinger are not in the novel at all even though they are living in the north.Since it has been so long between novels I found myself constantly going to the internet to refresh my memory on certain characters . In retrospect I think it 's a good idea to review the four previous books before attempting to read this one . This book is also filled with new characters especially in The Free Cities Valyria and Beyond the Wall . How Martin can keep up with all the strange names from all the Sellsword companies the people in Meereen and Yunkai is beyond me . It is a bit annoying trying to remember who Yurkhaz Zo Yunzak is or Reznak Mo Reznak for example . There are many heroes in this novel and numerous scrofulous villains new and old.One thing to remember about George Martin is that he plays no favorites when it comes time for a hero or villain to die . My one caveat is that this happens multiple times or does it ? The innuendos are astonishing through out the book.The last thing to mention is that you can tell by the book 's title the dragons are finally involved ! I will not tell you what part Drogon Viserion and Rhaegal play in this book but it is a big one . This was a pleasure to read my only regret is that I have finished it ! What do you read after this ? ",4
"Laborious . After the first 100 pages I swore if I had to read another page full of yet more food andor clothing description I would retch and retch I did.Repetitive . I believe I read the precise descriptors of a character and of another character 's feelings about an event at least three times over . Yes the same words.Irritating . Old characters are muddled dumb where they used to be smart etc . New characters could be interesting but somehow are not . And WHY must I read yet more about Cersei ? She was way too much of the last book I definitely did not want to read more of her.Angering . When even Daenerys becomes aggravating to read I know I 've waited this series out too long.There is something good in all of this I 'm only as annoyed as I am because I loved the characters GRRM created and I do n't like what he 's doing with them . However I did n't think GRRM would or could ! write anything to make me dislike Daenerys but I 've been proven wrong . ",1
"Book arrived in mint condition & delivery was very prompt ! Love the series captivating reading . Characters are a bit involved but there 's an index to help you sort it all out . ",4
"The only thing wrong with this book is you do n't want to finish it . This is a real treat for people who love welldeveloped characters and suspenseful plots . ",4
"Just finished this was looking for something to read and happened upon this series this summer . Started wonderfully well but alas I ca n't fully recommend this series . I like what Martin does with his series some characters actually die in it . But to some extent it seems by this point the best characters have been killed off . This latest book I had a hard time getting through . The writing is top notch as with all the previous books however I just do n't care for many of the characters . I liked many of the earlier ones but they ended up dead at some point or another . While it is rather unique to have some primary characters die quite a few of them over the last few books you eventually get to a point where you do n't wish to commit too much to any particular character because they will soon get bumped off . While Jordan does the opposite all the main characters are still alive after book eleven and they are bone tired by then this is the other extreme . Many of the good guys die and your left with bumbling children and vile queen regents that you wish would end up like many of the previous characters . Good book good series but could have been great if Martin would have picked some different characters to behead poison drown etc . etc . etc . ",2
"My husband has been engrossed in this book ever since he opened it on Christmas Day . Now he 's anxious for the next one . ",4
"A Dance with Dragons is every bit as good as the four books that preceded it . It continues to amaze me that Martin can conceive such complex yet integrated plots and write them in such a way that the books are pageturners . ",4
"It seems that all the the things the author did were fineuntil the initial large battles abated after the first three books . Then the same critics decided everything was wrong from style to the amount of description included . For my part I found this book fascinating in its portrayal of events that are widely separated but closely related . The introduction of new cultures on the Eastern Continent would not have been half as interesting if what made them unique was not included . That includes what they ate how they dressed and acted and what maladies they had . When you are dealing with a culture on a different world all the description aids the mind in forming a picture . I had a lot of good reading in this book . It made other authors look like they were rushing to finish.As usual having good intentions is not the only criterion for success of the characters . The characters are not static . Some learn from their experience and some do n't What they learn does not necessarily serve them well much as happens in real life . I for one am eagerly looking forward to the next installment . Winter has now arrived and survival will not be easy . ",4
"It 's better than book 4 . At least the characters I cared about from the first 3 books were again the main focus . That being said the story still moves very slowly . ",2
"I had a hard time figuring out if i was still reading the same author . The book made no sense . I believe GRRM is a little to full of himself . He is taking to long between books and I believe enjoys all the anguish this causes . I will not buy anymore of his books as he is just a wast of money . If you are thinking about buying this book just wait and it should be available at the library for free . ",1
"Book 5 of the Game of Thrones does not disappoint . All the intrigue of the first four with a few surprises thrown in . An excellent read ! ",4
"I 'm astounded at how many amateur reviewers manage to hit the problems square on the head yet George RR Lucas seems to think EVERYONE else has it wrong.Dance is a smidgen better than Feast . If not for Theon Dance would n't have even garnered that much faint praise.THE BOTTOM LINE I used to recommend this series . I rushed out and bought Feast in hardback the first day it came out . I waited several weeks to purchase Dance and even then only the Kindle version . If the next book averages 4 stars here on Amazon I may be tempted to give it one last chancebut I 'm through being an agent of the word of mouth campaign A Song of Ice and Fire has become embarrassing.I ceased reading and recommending Robert Jordan at book 4.And one last thing I 'm an adult who thinks adult language when overused is childish . In the first three books Martin 's abrasive language lent the series gritty depth but in Feast and Dance it feels more like a desperate ploy to maintain reader interest.Shocking exposition wo n't defibrillate a stale story .

"A Dance with Dragons is the 5th book in the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin . The hardcover is 1040 pages in length while the Kindle eedition is a 2119 Kb download.SPOILERSWithin the first few chapters you 'll be reacquainted with Jon Snow Tyrion Daenerys and Bran . Four important players that were absent or scarcely mentioned in A Feast of Crows.The location of these four individuals is as follows1 . Jon Snow 's story is at The Wallprobably my favorite tale.2 . Tyrion'stravels through the Free Cities areaslow to get going but improved with time.3 . Daenerysat Meereen on the Slaver 's Baya very slow tale to develop to the point of thinking about skimming some of it.4 . Branan interesting trek north of The Wall with a less prominent role than the other threeone gets the feeling that there are important things in store for Bran in subsequent books.There were also several other individuals whose tales were very interesting in particular Davos acting as the 'hand ' for King Stannis Baratheon at the Isles of The Three Sisters and at White Harbour and Theon Lord Ramsey 's prisoner.END SPOILERSIn addition to this fine story some other things I liked about the physical book itself1 . three maps Beyond the Wall The Free Cities and Valyria . These maps seem to have greater detail giving information on names places distances and direction . but see Cons 1.a below2 . an appendix in the back with an extensive Dramatis Personaelisting all the Houses as well as lesser groupings the characters within their relationship to each other and sometimes their present location.ConcernsRegarding the maps1a . in the Kindle format the maps are almost illegible . And unfortunately they become more indistinct as you expand them . This of course in not a flaw of the book but rather the limitation imposed by the Kindle rendering process.1b . the three maps are hard to relate to each other . You have a vague sense of the geographic layout but because there is no overall master map of the entire area it is somewhat difficult to get a feel for the 'lay of the land ' as to how the three maps provided are positioned geographically in relation to one another.2 . Daenerys taleslow to develop and repetitive to the point of being annoying.ConclusionWith the return of the major characters of the previous books my interest in this wonderful series has been rekindled.A definite improvement over A Feast of Crows not only because the more important characters have reappeared but the intrigue and tension so familiar with the first three books with the exception of Daenerys story has returned as well.Overall despite the minor concerns mentioned above I loved itafter a hiatus of many years it 's been worth the wait . And not unexpectedly Book 5 ends with many situations and developments hanging in the balance . 4 12 Stars.Ray Nicholson ",4
"I am the biggest fan of ASOIAF that you will find . The reason I 'm such a big fan however is because of the amazing quality of the first three novels . I consider A Storm of Swords to be the greatest book I 've ever read . A Feast Crows did not live up to the hype and ended up being a massive disappointment . With that said I still had hope that GRRM could right the ship . Unfortunately A Dance with Dragons is the worst book he has written yet . It is a book of pointless filler where almost nothing important happens . Too many chapters are simply unnecessary chapters where the character starts at one point and the chapter ends with himher still at the same point . There is little development whatsoever with ANY of the characters . There are a few good moments and surprises but not nearly enough to live up to Martin 's books.I waited 6 years for this novel and got a 1000 page book in which everything important that took place could have been completely summarized in less than 5 pages . Yes I 'm serious that 's how little took place in this book . Gone are the huge surprises the big battles and the sense of awe that you used to get while reading these books . When I read the first three books there were many moments where I just had a blank look on my face and thought Wow . These looks and feelings of awe have been replaced by feelings of boredom and yawns . ASOIAF looked like it was destined to become the greatest Fantasy series of all time but that has all gone out the window . Martin can still regain it however if he can deliver in the next book unlike with the past two.Martin is still the best fiction writer alive today but if it takes multiple years to release the next book I 'm going to give up on him . It 's criminally expensive to buy a hardcover book these days . ",0

"George R. R. Martin & ltstrong > A Dance with Dragons & ltstrong > Bantam 2011It took seven years for George R. R. Martin to finish and release the longawaited book five of A Song of Ice and Fire . Longer actually as it was originally intended to be a part of & ltem > A Feast for Crows & ltem > so it 's conceivable that some of the prose in this book is eleven years old . And let 's face it & ltem > A Feast for Crows & ltem > was by far the weakest link in the series so far . So perhaps I was a little more reluctant to pick up & ltem > A Dance with Dragons & ltem > than I would have otherwise been . In case you 're a fan of the first three books who 's been on the fence about it as well I 'm here to tell you that while this is n't & ltem > A Storm of Swords & ltem > it 's absolutely a return to form for Martin.We pick up a number of threads we last read about in 2000 probably not coincidentally the threads most favored by fans Tyrion 's Jon Snow 's and Dany 's . We also get a couple of new threads minor characters elevated to main character status most notably Reek whose identity remains a mystery until about halfway through the book but you know him . Twothirds of the way in we pick up the threads from & ltem > A Feast for Crows & ltem > as well and get reacquianted with the rest of the Lannister clan Arya and a few others . As for the plot if you 've been reading along you 're well aware of it though the action shifts from the War of the Five Kings which seems to be petering out to focus more on the east with a number of prospective rulers realizing that gaining Dany Targaryen 's alliance could mean the balance being tipped in their favor . Problem is Dany has more than enough problems of her own.There 's nothing I can tell you about & ltem > A Dance with Dragons & ltem > that I did n't tell you about the first three books in the series . Fastpaced actionpacked with excellent characters in interesting situations . It 's wonderful scurrilous bawdy majestic stuff and if you have n't yet discovered it give it a try . The books may look menacing this is the second of them to top a thousand pages but trust me they 're quick reads and absorbing as all getout . This is good stuff . ",4
"I have invested quite a bit of time reading this series . I will see it to the end . I just wish that end would come soon . This book is similiar to book 4 in that it seems to be stretching the story out for reasons other than the story . Some of the storylines would best be served as spin offs rather than pushing this tome to 1000 pages and delaying the end to a series that seems to have peaked in book 3 . ",2
"A trilogy in seven or more potentially volumes several thousand pages and nothing really happens . We waited how many years for this conclusion ? ? ? I have lost all faith in Mr. Martin and in his ability to actually end a story . The final pages of this book leave us with almost every interesting character either standing in a field or halfway to a desired destination wondering what comes next or even worse suddenly killed without warning . There is very little actual plot advancement from the end of Book Four.The Bible required only 2 Testaments to cover a great deal of material . War and Peace managed to be complete in ONE volume . Many many great authors have created satisfying masterworks in Trilogies.. Originally planned to be a trilogy this series was apologetically expanded to 4 volumes.. which still did n't reach a conclusion . Then there were FIVE volumes with a promised conclusion that did n't happen . Now there are chapters of a SIXTH volume making their appearance with hints that a SEVENTH volume may be necessary . Where does it end ? How many years ? Will Brian Sanderson be asked to complete this series when another five volumes eventually seem to be required . and Mr. Martin has retired at the age of 150 ? Will my great grandchildren still be alive when the final page is completed ? Will the TV series run even longer than The Simpsons ? ? ? Give us a break Mr. Martin ! It seems far easier to create a bunch of interesting characters than to know what to do with them . There are far too many characters in this series for anyone to expect the author to track them all the way to their ultimate goals so Mr Martin solves the situation by many many sudden deaths . Still it would have been pleasant to see the main characters eventually achieve some kind of goal . Even two of the three dragons vanish from the storyline shortly after being introduced.The one star is for creating interesting characters . Sorry that they are all after all these years left dangling or at least temporarily dead . ",0
"We 've entered Jordan County.If you 'll look to your right you 'll see a memorial to its namesake James Oliver Rigley Jr Robert to friends and fans who like many intrepid pioneers passed away in the midst of exploring his territory leaving others to finish.This excruciatingly detailed landscape includes such features as a glacial plot and a travesty of beloved characters.Jordan Country is pleased to welcome its newest settler George RR Martin.Alright seriouslyI 'm torn . On the one hand I greatly admire Martin and all he 's accomplished and I sympathize with the enormous challenge a series like this represents and nobody likes a Monday morning quarterback.On the other hand I feel Martin may be too close to see he 's getting away from what made his series great.My critique can be summed up succinctly why did this need to be written ? From what I understand Martin was originally going to do a break in years between SoS and the upcoming books but realized the flashbacks and backstory would be cumbersome to recap.Wellwhat does he thing made the first three so great ? All the little scenes of backstory peppered throughout ! Jaime 's time with the Kingsguard under Aerys the rebellion Littlefinger growing up with the Tullies all wonderful but did we need to see it all ? I get the feeling this new Martin would devote whole chapters to Tyrion 's marriage to Tysha their discovery and punishment.Like it or not and all those who praise Martin for breaking new ground probably wo n't Martin was writing to a formula . For all the wonderful complexity the basic skeleton was a simple one three books of setup two or three books of payoff.Greg Keyes is sometimes given the backhanded compliment of Martinlight but he has mastered the formula in all its permutations . I cite Keyes ' Age of Unreason series and more recently his Kingdom and Thorn and Bone series the first half two books in AoU and three in KoTaB dedicated to causing turmoil in the world and getting all the characters in position and having a lot of fun too and the last installment is all payoff.That was the formula Martin started with but he has wandered off the track.The problem is that so much of the first three books were devoted to getting certain key characters into position but once they were in position we do n't need to see them for awhile because we know very well nothing big can happen until those dragons are grown up.For me AFFC worked because none of the big characters were present and I was fine with that . There was nothing for them to do anyway.For example I would 've loved to see Bran and Arya ` fully formed ' in their sorcerer and assassin roles then maybe get a couple flashbacks or descriptions of their ` training ' days . Bran 's reveal as the greendreamin ' lord of the weirwood groves could have been an incredible climax maybe follow it up with a few brief flashbacks in the following bookBut enough whatifs.There are a lot of specific criticisms I could level but one stands out for me at least what is the point of Cersei getting her comeuppance now and at the hands of some secondary characters we do n't care about ? In the first three books we hated Joffrey Cersei Jaime and Tywin . We hated them with a passion because we saw them through the eyes of their victims and because Cersei Joffrey and Tywin kept getting away with it . Joffrey and Tywin got away with their rotten acts right up until the end and then we cheered when they finally died . Martin got the maximum mileage out of those two characters . With Cersei broken and reduced to an incidental character what satisfaction are we supposed to get when Dany finally comes along to topple her regime ? Needless to say but like Martin I 'll say it anyway ASOIAF is no longer on my ` buy before looking ' list . I do n't shell out my money till I get a library copy first.Meanwhile I 'll cross my fingers and hope Martin can pull a Uturn and get out of Jordan Country before his epic is lost in the quagmire .

"To all who care to read this before reading the next installment take this for what it is worth . The last tale A Feast For Crows and this A Dance With Dragons are one book split in an unusual way . I will spoil it by telling you that it is in the same time frame as the former but because if he had tried to publish them as one he could not have done it justice or even kept it under the nearly 2000 pages the two are in combination . Think of this in that way when you read it and you will love the story . If you loved the others as dark as they are you will love this . ",4
"If you liked the previous books you 'll love this one . This book has to be one of my favorites in the series . ",4
"All of these books of Martin 's could have been written in a third of the amount of words by editing the many useless and repetitive descriptions . This author loves to hear himself talk w out EVER telling a story . ",0
"I call this series of books a Hydra because every time Martin kills someone off three more story lines appear . The entire series so far could have been a simple trilogy . Nevertheless I have to admit it 's hard to put them down . ",4
"The first 4 books all well written came to no conclusions except for the characters that were killed off . This book is n't as well written revealed very little story and less conclusions to the story began . The whole thing feels like a ploy to make more money without offering any reader satisfaction . I have to confess that having read over two thousand of Martins pages and being a real GoT fan computer gamesTV series etc.it was all a gigantic disappointment but at least I wo n't be looking forward future books of his I was a sucker but I 'm done . ",0
"The worst book I have read in ten years.Over priced over hyped.Two thirds of this book should have been edited and left on the floor.This is the best that Mr. Martin can do after 6 years ? If so please let it be the last.This was one of the most eagerly awaited books in years and a major flop.The book like the last couple he has wrote was hard to read.The reader must be committed to the story devote endless hours to the book for NO ending.Way way way to many twists and turnsto many people places thingsthat have to be remembered.Mr Martin it does not need 50 pages on how a spoon looks or another 30 on how the person raised it to his mouth to eat . Not to mention that is ok to leave some of the good guys alive.I do n't mind killing off the main subject from time to time but you have pushed this to the limit . I have purchased his other 4 books and was ok with them some better then others.This is my last book that I intend to buy from him . ",0
"Let me first say I have enjoyed all of the Song of Ice and Fire series including this novel . I rated it three stars because there was just SO much left unresolved in this book . It 's been ages since I read the previous novel so I spent a lot of time trying to recall what happened and I felt that shortly after I got a good hold on it and reidentified with each character 's story the book ended . I expected a lot of issues to remain unresolved things that have been carried throughout the books but I felt like a lot of new issues were introduced very briefly and then completely dropped . I think that trying to hang onto all the threads was difficult while I was reading the book and will be really difficult by the time the next one comes out . The whole novel just seemed a little more disjointed and less tidy than the rest of his works in this series but I did remain very interested throughout and am looking forward to the next . ",2
"Well what do you expect its the Song of Ice And Fire George RR Martin . This is the stuff of legend ! If you want to watch HBO 's Game Of Thrones then you must read the books or you are missing out on 60 % of the story . ",4
"I have been looking forward to this book for a while and Martin did not disappoint . This book had me entranced from the first page . I definitely recommend this to anyone ",4
"This was equal to or better than Book 1 . The movement through the chapters is far easier to follow and is more fluid . ",4
"Ok Game of Throwns need I say more . The interwining stories are wonderful and it is a series to get lost in . I actually am enjoying this from a business perspective how to screw your way to the top and then get killed by your competition . ",4
"Mind Boggling ! Another interesting and mind boggling book added to the series . The drama continues with many twist and turns as plots within plots materialize . The book itself was not smooth flowing until the second half of the book . The chapters seem to cover the inbetween scenarios that happened either before or after some of the drama that unfolded in the last 4 books.These chapters were in no order and I got bored with too much description of the surrounding lands their histories and the men who came beforehand . I just had a hard time getting through some of the chapters because it was at a stand still with nothing happening that was in my opinion not relevant to the main plot or maybe it was just me being impatient and wanting to get to the main point of finding out the outcome.Everyone in this series is going mad to take over the seven kingdoms not just one king within the seven but several lords in their own lordhoods . To top it off there are those outside the seven kingdoms across seas that have their sights on the throne as well but their kingdoms are full of their own destruction and underhandedness of chaos to include all the cut throats fighting each other to gain the princess and her dragons to take the throne . Yet all the while evil magical and paranormal forces consume the ordinary folk through false religious covers sorcerydemon worship and old magical powers.Overall though the many plots within continue to get closer to a climax . Hopefully the readers do n't have to read through 5 more books to get to there . The writing is great and the characters are well established and just when you think you have a favorite character the author has a way of making the good one bad and the bad one a hero.Great Read ! Spoilers Below this Point NOTESto read before I read the 6th book whenever it is releasedNight 's WatchJon Snow one of my favorite characters and his white Dire wolf . I like what he does by opening the gates to the wildlings and in this book his sworn brothers are not happin with him and in this book in the end Jon is stabbed but it doesnt state whether he is dead or not because Lady Melisandre the red priestess is there and you never know what kind of sorcery she will do.2 . Samwell Tarly is not mentioned in this bookHouse Stark1 . Bran is beneath ground with the Three Eyed Crow last greenseersorcererand the children of the forest . He has become part of the Direwood and is learning to fly but this book does n't spend much time on him just one chapter . Hodor is still with him.2 . Rickon this book does n't cover him at all and he was split from Bran in the 4th book . He is with Osha the wildling woman.3 . Jon Snow still does n't know his brothers live.4 . Lady Stark is still alive in the 4th book but she is not mention in this book.House Tully1 . Bends the knee to King Tommen in the book due to Jamie Lannister.King of the Seven Kingdoms1 . Tommen 8 year old King son of ex QueenCersei2 . Cersei ex Queen yes I hate her and she is finally charged with treason insest fornication and was degraded through out the city by having to walk naked through her own people she deserves death but we wo n't know what her outcome is until after her trial when Ser Robert Strong fights for her innocence.3 .

I love his sense of humor his part in this series is the best . In this book he finds himself across seas mixed up with a knight and another dwarf and are slaves .

I think him and Melisandre are up to no good and will change everyone to demons or something in the end but in this book it is left with him still missing from castle rock and no one has heard from him . He was suppose to have been burned but Melisandre used magic to disguise Rattleshirt Lord of Bonesas him in order to fake the death.4 . Ser Davos Seaworth King Stannis Hand but in the book he is left in limbo he was captured but secretly released so he could gather a force for King Stannis.King of the Isles and the North1 .

Victarion GreyJoy Euron 's brother this guy is full of himself at end he is on his way to claim the Princess Dani and her dragons for himself instead of for his brother Euron.3 . Asha GreyJoy I love her she is one tough cookie . She however is captured by Stannis and in the end in limbo we do n't know if she is still with Stannis or not.House Arryn The ValeIn this book the Vale is not mentioned but in book 4 Robert Arryn otherwise known as sweet robin he becomes King as his mother is thrown off the mountain by her husband Petyr Baelish Littlefinger .

"Five books later at an expensive investment I will not read Book 6 7 8 9.. ? ? ? I loved the first three even four books . Then this book five comes outand what a crock ! A l000 pages that could have been edited easily to 500 pages without sacrificing plot.What plot.this book five just drags on and on.going nowhere.Only in the last 200 pages did any of the story line progress at all.Why does George R.R . Martin have to be so verboise ? His fifth book of meanderings is useless . He is like a mad man on speed going off on moretangents than need be.I am angry that I spent the time and money on this one.But I will learn my lesson . Skip this book five . It in no way adds to the the earlierfour that was suppose to be only a triology.It could have been a triology but the editors ' were evidently afraid of facingthe dragon RR Martin when he is such a 'stark struck literary darling ' as a never endinggolden purse for the publishers..to rein him in on verbriage that never should have been allowed.But a golden calf is a golden calf.thinking of more gold by stretching these books out into infinity.No I quit the series now once and for good .

"There are SPOILERS involved with this review . I have to include these because the GRRM fanatics believe that if you do not like this book then you have never read the book and therefore if you post on any of the forums you must be a troll unless you include spoilers to prove you read the book.First can we stop with the endless repetitions ? ? ? These are repeated hundreds of times throughout the book after a while it is just worthless and we realize the Mr.Martin is just trying to up his word count.1.Where do whores go ? The imp dsoe n't know we get it.2.Reek Reek my name is reek it rhymes with ? ? ? ? ? . We get it reek rhymes with many different words are you going to go through the alphabet ? 3.You know nothing Jon Snow . O.K . He 's ignorant can we move on ? 4.I am just a young girlDany 's young are you trying to make sure we do n't forget or that you do n't Mr. Martin ? 5.Word are wind . We know we read your book . We are surprised that it did not blow itself off the shelves.6.Corn . Corn . CornOkay Ravens eat corn we know.First of all there is way TOO MUCH filler and fluff in this book.At the beginning we are given page after page after page after page etcof fluff just to find out that A six skins dies and enters the one eyed wolf and B that Jon Snow is a skin changer too but dose n't know it.Conserning Jon we are subjected to a second retelling of Jon sending away Sam and making the baby switch . Did Mr Martin forget that he wrote this in AFFC ? Does he think his readers forgot it has been a while ? After letting the wildlings cross the wall to help fight the others somehow his seasoned brothers are all retarded and do not understand that they are undermaned and will die and lose the wall without help.Jon is then stabbed four times by his brothers . We are never told he is dead and never see his body so because of all the endless drivel at the beginning of the book most readers will have missed that he is a skin changer so maybe he changed skins maybe he is just wounded or maybe he will come back from the dead like his mother.Bran finds the three eyed crow and learns that he is a greenseer.With the imp we are treated to his bathroom habits . Do we really need to know everytime he goes to the bathroom ? Have a little bit of a hang up with the bathroom habits of little people do we Mr. Martin ? Then we are treated to his travel log . Worse than reading a tech manual . Words are wind Mr. Martin.He then becomes a slave rides a pig in a mummers joust walks away from slavery and on his word alone hires a sellsword company and joins them.The onion knight eats and we get to hear of every bite . We know you like food Mr. Martin we 've seen your pic but we do not need a play by play of his eating.A . Stark loses her sight and then gets it back and then commits her first assaination.Thon Grayjoy through torture is transformed into Reek . Eventually he helps Jane escape Ramsay Bolton.Dany keeps telling anyone who will listen that she is young as if they or she has forgotten . She chains up two dragosn because they are uncontrollable . She thenmarries and then flys away on the black dragon while Mereen is underseige.The prince of Dorn is killed by the green dragon fire while trying to steal the two dragons who are locked up.Mr . Martin thought his baby switching plot was so good that he told it again in this book . Not only that but he was so proud of this original idea that he recycled itthree times . We are told that a prince of dragons was not killed during the first rebellion but was switched as a baby and now he is back to retake the iron throne . Then we are told that the king beyond the wall did not die by fire but was switched with rattleshirt . Plus A. Stark and Jane are switched . Who else are we going to switch ? Maybe Jon was not Jon when he was stabbed maybe he was switched . Might as well recycle the plot one more time.Cersie confesses some of her crimes and does a walk of shame . Now she is awaiting trial by combat.The queen is waiting a trial by the church.Little finger returns to kill the king regent because he wants the kingdoms to be at war so it is easier for the dragon prince to retake the iron throne.Jamie rides away with Brienne and is not heard from.Stannis marched on winterfell where we again are given more filler than you can shake a stick at . Do we need a play by play of the snow march ? Then we are told in a letter that he and his friends are dead maybe a lie ? .Mance Rayder switched with rattleshirt takes six spear wives and tries to free the Stark girl again a recycling of the switching plot she is not Stark but Jane.We are told in Ramsay 's letter that he is held captive and the six spear wives are dead.There was supposed to be a continunity check but we find out that grayscale is not what it was . It was a childhood disease but has somehow become a life long illness like leprosey.Mr . Martin tells us he has a problem writing strong women and children . Well maybe he should not have so many strong women and children in his book . It is funny though that he did not have a problem writing strong women and children in the first three books . Are we sure Mr. Marting wrote books four and five ? Dany and Jon are totally different characters with no development on how they changed . He has lost sight of his story and is now offereing us filler and excuses.People have been comparing him to Tolkin . The only thing he and Tolkin have in common is the RR in their names . Anyone who makes this comparison has never read Tolkin or has become so emotionally invested in this story that they are blind to the truth . Tolkin never wrote just to see how many words he could put to paper . He wrote a complete story from start to finish . At Mr. Martins pace and with these last two books of his he will be remembered as The man who tried real hard.The only saving grace about this book is that I got it for free . I am the third person to read this copy and the first person received it as a gift . I will give it to someone else so that at least four people will not have paid for this crap and four people will not have given Mr. Martin anymore money . I am leaving now to trade my copies of the first four books of this series at the used bookstore . Maybe I will go back to Eddings . ",0
"The series The Game of Thrones is an excellent read . The reader becomes involved with all the characters in the books . Book 5 A Dance with Dragons is a good read also but the ending is a little abrupt . The ending is disappointing but at the same time it makes you want the series to go on . A book 6 would be nice to help ease the sense of disappointment and abruptness in Book 5 's ending . The series of The Game of Thrones is highly recommended as an excellent read . ",3
"Though I ca n't say that I liked what happened it kept me wrapped up in it every step of the way . I really wished the series could have just gone on and on . ",4
"A Dance with Dragons takes us from one side of the Narrow Sea to the other from the Wall to Westeros rollicking from one character to another . George R. R. Martin spares no characters no matter how much we love or hate them . Each chapter leaves us hanging What did he mean when he said Brienne screamed one word ? Was she dead ? What about Jon Snow ? And where is Sam ? What part does he play in all this ? And what 's happened to Peter Baelish and Sansa Stark ? And will Mance Rayder be saved once more this time from Ramsay Bolton ? Will Ramsay get his just desserts ? Will Daenyres rule the Seven Kingdoms ? Will this Winter be the worst ? I join my tenant with whom I discuss the books as often as we would discuss the news of the day in urging the author to finish and publish Book Six . ",4
"This is the fifth book in a series . I first saw the video of Game of Thrones and was hooked so I bought the book which really cemented my interest in the Starks and the Lanisters . I could n't wait to read the next book which had many surprising twists that led me to the third book which I enjoyed but not as much as the preceding volumes . I struggled with the fourth book but did finally finish it and I purchased the fifth book which was so slow and dull that I quit reading after 600 pages I might ultimately finish it but I 'll wait and see . I became entranced with Ned and Catelyn Stark and their Children Sansa Robb Bran Arya and Rickon . Tyrion Lanister was easily the most interesting character I have encountered in a long time . Cersei and Jaime Lanister were equally fascinating as was Brienne . But Martin killed off Ned and Catelyn Stark and that was just the beginning . By the time you get to Dances with Dragons Robb Stark is murdered Arya has disappeared into some sort of religious order but her status is unresloved . Jon Snow has gone off fighting Zombies of all things and his story just gets duller and duller . Bran seems to be headed into some sort of weird status as a changling or a tree undetermined . Rickon Stark just vanishes from the story . Tyrion 's story just drags on and on with no resolution and his ultimate fate is not resolved . Jaime seems on the cusp of redemption with Brienne but his story is left hanging and whether or not Brienne was killed is left open . In short all of the characters who made the story interesting are either killed off or left hanging for what surely must be book 6 . To make matters worse books 4 and 5 could easily have been reduced to 300 pages each by simply dropping all of the tedious descriptions of clothes and food . Plus more and more characters are introduced who lack any of the interest of the original characters . I found myself skimming through whole pages of descriptions that did nothing for the story . I started skipping all of Jon Snow 's battle with the zombies as being simply too dumb to accept . At that point I realized I was done and no longer cared about any of the characters . A great start to a wonderful series but it deteriorates into a very poorly written soap opera about people I do n't like and have no interest in . It is a dull and tedious end to what could have been a great story . ",1
"Again a well written book by G. Martin but missing some of the characters that I have loved and find it hard to wait for the next book to find out ",3
"Book 5 A Dance with Dragons a Song of Ice and Fire by George RR Martin continues the fascinating and wellwritten saga in the Game of Thrones series . It is quite a long book but worth reading so plan to spend some time getting deeper into the complex and sometimes perplexing series .

"Well he 's back and with the same flare that made Storm of Swords so gripping . Was it worth the wait ? Yes and no . I 'm still mad about waiting over ten years for two books one of which was not very good the one before this but this book is not like Feast of Crows this is a return to the character depth haunting scenes internal struggles and amazing world building imagination that made him so great in the first place . If it were a matter of having a half ass story and not having to weight so many years or having this I would go with this and accept the wait with ill mastered patience . But please do n't do that to us again George . ",4
"I was hooked from the start . This is one of the few books that can still let me escape from my modern day world . I forget about time and everything going on around me when reading this . I 'm 23 of the way through the last book and am reading slower and slower . I do n't want it to end ! ",4
"So I was confused . I thought A Dance With Dragons was the last book in the series for like 90 % of the book . So I spent most of this book royally pissed off that nothing was resolving the way I hoped it would . Then I read a blurb or review or something that said 2 more to come.Yay ! So I guess what I mean to say is that this book was a fantastic chapter in the series it just did n't resolve anything ",4
"This one was just as ingrossing as the past 4 and left me completely mad at the author over cliffhangers . Trying to wait patiently for winds of winter and dream of spring but unfortunately may not be out til 2014 sadness . ",4
"If you read the other books you 'll enjoy reading this one . George does n't disappoint with this return to Westeros and the lands beyond . ",4
"Readers who have invested their time in this story will like this addition to the saga . I have enjoyed reading this tale . Most of the characters are appealing and the authors descriptions of the landscapes and of the people and creatures that live there are vivid and engrossing . The reason I gave the book only four stars is that for me some passages that explain the history of individuals and places are excessively detailed and so long that I found myself skimming over long passages to get back to what I enjoy most the interactions of the peoples with each other and with their environment . It is a good read and I would recommend it to friends . ",3
"The entire series of the Game of Thrones is great . This book continues with the story and makes you want to read more . ",4
"I enjoyed Dance with Dragons . Martin struggled with his two previous books but this one had some good character development a lot of intrigue and plenty of his trademark maincharacter deaths . This one still had some serious slow parts but was thankfully better than others . Hopefully Martin can keep it moving from here to the end . ",3
"Loved the first 3 books but NOTHING is happening in this series . The last few books have been nothing but characters sailing or riding from one location to another . That 's it . Not a single thing was resolved in this massive book . Just a total story failure on every level . Sucks . ",1
"Sure it may not be as exciting as the first three but the book is still excellent and necessary to the proper continuation of the story . I do not really know where all of the rage surrounding this and the fourth book come from but I think a lot of it comes from the time that people have had to wait on them and the expectations that they built up . Rather than getting any resolution this book ultimately leaves you with more waiting . I am fine with that but I can see why others are not I guess . ",4
"800 pages of filler . How many times do I have to read the ritual for the Lord of Light ? Lord of Light hear us . Lord of Light defend us for the night is dark and full of terrors .

He will continue to strike while the iron is hot and take on 200 projects at a time and swear up and down he is busy working out the mereneese knot .

She went from one of my favorite characters to oh crap not another Daenarys chapter . So yeah all in all we were ripped . He absolutely knows what he is doing . I love how he put off the release until the HBO show finished with a few weeks inbetween for people to read books 14 and be ready to buy book 5 . If you think that was coincidental you are an idiot . No way it took him 6 years to write this book . No way it took him 3 years to unravel the knot . Last book I buy written by GRRM . I will wait for the series to be completed and buy them from a used bookstore . I will not contribute another penny to GRRMs greed . ",1
"This series started out wonderful I loved the 1st two book and the 3rd was ok . This one and the 4th one were terrible . The problem is there are too many characters too much unnecessary dialogue and the biggest problem is the plot is moving too slow . At this rate the story wont be nearly finished in book 7 . Maybe if books came out every year this wouldnt be a problem but they only come out every 4 or 5 years . I am really mad bc this series was soo good at the beginning . ",0

"While I disliked having to wait five years for A Dance with Dragons as much as anyone else I was n't too disappointed with the experience of reading it . In fact I was thrilled just to be immersed in George R.R . Martin 's gritty living world again and to revisit my favorite characters Tyrion Jon Snow Daenyrs and a few others and locations . I could n't put down the audiobook well the device containing it.In case you 've been living under a rock for the past decade or do n't read much fantasy I join the many readers who regard the first three books in The Song of Ice and Fire series as landmark works in modern fantasy rivaling Tolkien in the sheer force of vision behind them . Of course Martin does n't write like Tolkien and the nature of his vision is very different . His world hearkens as much back to Robert E. Howard 's Romantic Conan the Barbarian mythos which never needed an explicit good versus evil struggle to define its characters . Martin 's is a more grownup version of that universe recognizing that there 's plenty of drama in humans as they really are in the constant struggle between survival pleasure codes of honor and realpolitik.The first three books were tough acts to follow and Martin can be partially forgiven for falling a little short on books four and five . However the chorus of frustration from fans is n't without merit . Martin kind of painted himself into a corner back in 2004 when he realized that the book he was writing had gotten too long . Rather than edit it down to a more manageable size he split it in two . A Feast for Crows wound up being an immense novel of in which lots of hitherto minor characters got placed into new intrigues along with some new characters . Was there was a larger purpose to these minor adventures ? Or had the author just gotten swallowed in his own world convinced that what the reader really wanted on this bus tour through Westeros was more stops with no roadside stand or historic marker not worth a visit ? Hey it worked for Patrick Rothfuss.A Dance with Dragons does n't really resolve those questions but at least we get the major characters back and the things eventually start to pick up steam and head somewhere . Tyrion hitchhikes his way east by a few lessthanideal arrangements . Jon Snow tries to do his duty while dealing with the conflicting demands of an impatient king . And Theon Greyjoy makes a return in very changed circumstances . As always the living breathing world remains brilliantly vibrant and alive its drama infecting everything that happens in the foreground . For example there 's one sequence in which soldiers are sent on a dreadfully misplanned winter mission not unlike Napoleon 's troops in Russia . While this sequence could have been shorter the details of cold starving weary men were so vivid I did n't really care I was just along for the ride . And the chapters with Daenrys in Myreen illustrate the difficulties of ruling a liberated land in a way that seems not unfamiliar apparently Martin turned on the news during the past five years . By the time the dragons in the story finally come into their own we 're feeling as ready for it as she is . Too bad so much ends on cliffhangers hopefully it will take only three years before we find out what happens.I agree with a few other reader complaints . Martin has slipped into the bad habit of repeating catchphrases words are wind my name is Reek and important pieces of information multiple times from multiple angles rather than trusting readers to see the connections themselves . The new characters he introduces are n't terribly interesting and there 's little tension for now over the possibility that our old favorites will die as they have in the past . I would n't have minded a little more exploration of strange and wondrous things e.g . the ruins of Valyria . Finally while I think that the level of violence and cruelty in Martin 's world has been necessary in shaping his characters there are places in this novel where it borders unsettlingly on gratuity.On the audiobook experience I had very mixed feelings . Overall Roy Dotrice 's grandfatherly tones are a great fit for Martin 's writing but to my ears he gets some voices horribly wrong . Young women sound like old hags or Monty Python members in drag . Too many knights sound like Long John Silver and Tyrion could be a leprechaun . For the first hours I was tempted to give up and get the print edition but luckily my ears adapted . In general I 'm pretty tolerant of lessthanperfect readers for audiobooks your mileage may vary.Yet all that said I remained hooked on the series and even a flawed entry is one I ca n't put down . Martin has tested us with two long novels of buildup buildup and more buildup but I remain hopeful that the tour bus will be getting back on the highway and heading towards the big destinations that his fans signed on for.12 ",3

"The first chapter of A Game of Thrones involved The Other 's attacking and killing a group of men from the Night 's Watch . After reading that introductory chapter is there anyone who would have wagered that five books later The Others would have barely appeared again and done very little when they did ? This is an example of the issues with Martin 's story over the last two books . New stories are being added to the narrative and the story from the first few books is is moving at a glacial pace . A story that started with 7 or 8 main characters has expanded to over 25 and the series is suffering as a result.There are long stretches in this book where nothing happens . It 's adreadfully slow read and does not match the excitement and thrills of the first three books in the series . ",0
"Okay . I 'm done.No more Song of Ice and Fire books for me . After trying to follow the characters that I was supposed to remember from volumes # 1 through # 4 and doing a fair job of it while studying blowups of the tiny maps at the front of the book I decided the effort was n't worth it . Yes I still care whether or not Arya regains her sight Jon succeeds in defending the broken kingdoms from the evils descending upon them from beyond the wall Tyrion finds his true love Caytlin is reunited with her children the direwolfs find their masters Bran reaches his goal and Daenerys finally rides a dragon . But honestly the bloated writing and overthetop cruelty and violence do not compel me to continue reading anymore.Someone please give me a summary of what happens at the end of Volume # 6 or # 7 or # 8 or whichever one is the end and I 'll be happy .

"I just finished book five.it was an epic read I mean that I made it through . There are no plot spoilers here . I 'm a big fan of Tolkien Lewis Herbert even Rowling and I was excited to find another author who wrote the BIG fantasy stories..but I found that unlike those mentioned there was no nobleness or goodness in any of the characters unless they were to be killed off or physically maimed in some horrible way . By the end of the book I really did n't care what happened to any of those who are still alive or may be alive or at least are not dead . the plot was so twisted it was difficult to know . I actually had thought of starting a family tree project to keep track of the characters but this is only a book and I 'm not planning on spending any more time with them or on future offerings . I am sorry this was not the next BIG fantasy writer I have been looking for..guess I 'll go back to the above mentioned authors and enjoy a read that makes me appreciate the goodness of their humanity .

"LOTS OF SPOILERS warning ! ! ! Best SciFi TVI am currently dipping in and out of this book as I watch the new TV series.There are two great features of GOT one each character has their own chapter and 2 you are therefore follow individual story lines without reference to the rest of the book.While in the first book there was a lot of cross overs between the stories now in book fivea whole bunch of characters are on very separate quests.This sunny Sunday it occured to me that this tome 5 was a bleak and depressing read.1 Daenerys is stuck with her 'rabbit ears ' lots of political compromise and general married life misery2 Cersei and Marguery are both locked up awaiting trial the first quite rightly the second more problematically3 Jaime wanders around the country breaking sieges with compromises and promises4 Arya is off in Bravos doing what we 're not sure and its not relevant5 Bran is off North of the wall doing what we 're not sure and again the relevance is lost on me6 Jon Snow is having a miserable time dealing with a bunch of convicts sent north from Kinglanding who seem set of having their own mini war within the wall7 Theon & the Boltons Ramsey and Romsey lets not even go there.Best SciFi BookThe point of GOT if there was ever a point is that surely the Starks and there were six children . One has to survive win back and succeed as the new king surely that has got to be the main point of this story.At the end of this book it feels like all the Starks are irrelevant or about to die ? Which makes me think why bother with book 8 ? Note to author please can we have a happy ending or something for the Starks ? ",4
"WARNING this review will be semispoilery ! Anywho first reaction WHY THE HELL WAS THIS BOOK SO LONG ? I had the feeling that this one would be packed with action unlike its predecessor the rambling and boring A Feast for Crows . It came on the heels of A Storm of Swords easily my favorite book in the series but I was not prepared for its length where absolutely nothing happens . I expected more from ADwD especially since it took so long to write . But nope . In the vein of AFfC it was all setup . Which is fine but someone needs to get GRRM a better editor because we do not need nearly 2000 pages of setup . I understand it 's an epic story . But really GRRM you 're just drowning yourself and your readers.Second of all I have a problem with all of the cliffhangers . I feel like cliffhangers that resolve NOTHING are super cheap to the reader because we have to wait such a long time to find out what happens . It 's like in TV shows where the MC dies at the end of the season and you have to wait months to find out oh they were n't really dead . It 's cheap . A good cliffhanger should resolve most of the plot while still leaving some juicy threads . GRRM 's cliffhangers are all threads . Nothing was resolved . Dany continued to be annoying in Mereen where she hooked up with Daario only AFTER getting engaged . Jon became a good leader but then was 'killed ' at the end . Quotations because I know he is not dead . I hate that GRRM brings so many people back from the dead . I thought that after Ned and Robb we knew people could die . But now they either do n't die or are resurrected . It 's annoying . Tyrion 's chapters at least contained some character development . There were only two Arya chapters only ONE Jaime chapter in which he was kidnapped by an obviouslyalive Brienne and a small number of Bran chapters . For so many pages we could 've gotten more of their stories and he could 've cut out some of the food description.The only thing that I really loved about this book was Theon 's character arc . I HATED Theon in ACoK but I felt so bad for him as Reek and I was immensely satisfied at his final words in ADwD . Say what I will about GRRM but he is awesome at characterization . He made me love Jaime and he made me love Theon.If only because this is an ASOIAF book I 'll give it ",2
"The book is very long and even as an ardent and enthusiastic reader it got a bit much for me at times with many characters and plots . The fact that he is constantly killing off characters makes it hard to get invested and is always involving more plots and more people makes it a loooot of information to try to keep in mind at any one time . I found the XRay function on my Kindle invaluable in this regard as it will quickly help you remember who is who . Another frustrating thing is that he sometimes uses pseudonyms which adds to the general complexity and chaos of the book . The series is excellent shockingly real and brutal and I would recommend it . But come prepared for a lot of information and for the fact that you will almost certainly lose track of what is happening and be left unsatisfied with cliffhangers at regular intervals . ",3
"The first three books were great . The fourth one was lacking and I had hoped that this fifth one would redeem the fourth book by being as good as the first three it did not.Describing things places men that have been described by the author before a hundred times gets old . The descriptions take me nowhere that I have n't already been or want to go . Entire chapters about people that I do n't care about or that I did n't come to like as well as the characters who 've been conveniently killed so things will become a little more simple these chapters pretty much are worth skipping or browsing looking for quotation marks and key words that may have something to do with someone who is interesting.Anyway if there are going to be seven of these books I guess that I can wait five years for the next one and I 'll probably buy it and read it . I read that Robert Jordan series and that was trying . There 's always Moby Dick I have n't read that in a while . ",1
"The only reason I did n't give this 5 is because now I have to wait till Mr Martin finishes books 6infinity . My husband teases that I might need an intervention . Martin has made the characters so multidimensional that it is impossible to completely hate any of them with the possible exception of Joffrey . OK I hate Cersei Lannister as well . ",3
"Read all others in hard copy but this one I used the cloud to download it . The only problem with reading in on a tablet is that when I want to see a map of where the people in the book are I ca n't easily access it or have n't figured out how to yet . Same with the end of the book where they give all the houses and who belongs to each . Can not access this either . Had to go to Amazon today and had to Look Inside at the first few pages of the book so I knew what was where . Normally having to flip to the beginning or end of a book is not a problem but with this story not being able to flip back and forth is an issue . ",3
"I read a lot of negative reviews and was expecting an aimless book of recipes . The author has evolved . Good or bad he is not the same scribe who penned the first book . I enjoyed reading book 5 . His hallmarks of character development murder and deviant cruelty are in place . If you want the dynamics of book 3 read said book . Book 5 leaves the reader hoping for book 6 . ",3
"GRRR Martin has created a complex rich textured world that shows great insight into the personal social political military economic and sexual forces that must have shaped the evolution of Europe in the middle ages . On top of that he 's incorporated some pretty colorful dragons and zombies . I keep waiting for him to role out some Vampires.He creates compelling believable characters and riveting stories . His prose is venerable and the books have been made into one of the best television series I have ever seen . This world and its people are created in exquisite detail which is part of why the story is so rich and realistic.That said I have two issues with his pentad at times it reads far too slowly to keep my interest and there are too many characters and subplots for anyone save an idiot savant to remember so that he must resort to complex appendices to help the reader sort through it . I 'm happy to slog my way through the details of European history but i do n't wish to work that hard for Westerosian fantasy.The fourth book left several characters we have grown to care about in the midst of unresolved conflict Jon Snow Bran Tyrion Sansa Jaime Arya and Daenys . Hopefully the histories will be resolved and unified in the fifth book.That was compelling reason enough to read it but now one is faced with at least 10 more characters and their various tangential tribulations . I think this is a flaw in plotting . It reminds me of the TV series Lost which similarly LOST me in its extraordinary myriad convolutions . ",2
"Loved it ! ! Ca n't wait for the next one ! ! ! ! ! I hope it 's not too long before the next one comes out . ",4
"After waiting five years for this opus I was terribly disappointed . The story did not move along . More characters and new plot lines were added . Nothing was resolved . ",1
"When I watched the television show it did n't catch my interest . My son kept telling me to read the books . I did and I got hooked . Great characters with so many story lines . Now I want to watch the shows . Ca n't wait for Winter book . ",4
"The book was good but you are really left with the feeling there is more to come not sure when that will be but anytime will be most welcome ",4
"I read the first four books and while I thought it was very well written I got really tired of all the good characters getting killed off . I mean 1 or 2 should be smart enough or lucky enough to survive too the next book . Nez pas ? ",2
"Story moves at a very slow pace in book 5. very few significant events take place during the book . Sansa POV was totally absent and that was a bit disappointing . Expected to see more of Bran and Arya as they are two of the most promising characters . Dany who is normally a good POV was kind of wasted this time with same old thoughts and babbles.However really loved Jon Snow in the book . Cant wait to see next few POVs of him . ",2
"I enjoyed this one ! Compelling viewpoint characters returned and the new characters were also well done . There was refreshingly little Cersei.Dance with Dragons came through with what it promised the interesting parts of the story omitted in Feast for Crows . ",3
"unlike many of my friends who told me this book was awful and they only skimmed it really ? what 's the point ? I enjoyed this and the previous installment of the series . There are a lot of characters in the story overall and I appreciate that Martin tries to give them all time . I also appreciate that the supergory is left out for the most part . I do n't need to read battle scene after battle scene but I enjoy the backstory and motivations of the characters . I ca n't wait for the next one to be finished so I can find out what happens . ",3
"Spoilers ahead For me the first two books were filled with exciting events and the whole narration featured many enjoyable characters interacting with each other i.e . Robert and Cersei Lord Baelish and Ned Tyrion and Jon Arya and Syrio . Also it was easy to grasp the geography of the story . In the latest 2 books exciting and historymaking events are few and far between . As far as I can tell only 4 truly important events took place in books 4 and 5 Cersei destabilizing King 's Landing and allowing the priests to rise to power Jon letting the wildlings through the wall Dany marrying that guy and disappearing on a dragon and Aegon beginning his conquest of Westeros . Since the Brienne Stannis Jamie Tyrion Bran Arya Selyse Melisandra and Greyjoy narratives have n't really gone anywhere yet I do n't count them . I kind of feel like we 're reading Martin 's notes instead of the grand narrative as it should be.Meanwhile most of the interesting characters are separated from each other and paired with a host of less enjoyable or ephemeral characters . Particularly annoying was all the time wasted on Quentyn Martell who we met for the first time in this book he did basically nothing of note for 100 pages and then he died . Furthermore he and his companions were not in the least entertaining to read about.And the disjointed maps make it difficult for me to figure out where one place is in relation to all the other places . Mr. Martin please finish your map of Essos ! And then please make a single map of the whole region ! I am sad to admit that while reading books 4 and 5 I continuously consoled myself that HBO if it ever got around to these books would surely edit the narration down into a polished elegant series . They 'll probably add more sex though . ",2
"I enjoyed this book immensely . Martin has a very descriptive way of writing which is both a gift and a curse . I love losing myself in the pages it is easy to do . However there are just waaay too many characters . I care for the core characters from the first book and not necessarily the minutiae of every scribeknightfamily member of said core . I will read the next book then reread all of them as I am hooked . ",2
"The story slows down alot from the first few books but still a great story and a great read . I love the character development it seems like everyone is taking a rest to figure out what they want to do rather than the normal fast paced action of the earlier books . ",3
"You are not William Faulkner . You 're not even Cormac McCarthy . You 're a fine writer of soap opera scripts which is perhaps why you have NO idea how to wrap this up and end it effectively . Like Stephen King you started with some fine creativity and when you became famous you began to think you were smarter than your editor . You are wrong . Get some help . You are just irritating most of your readers at this point . ",0
"Beware slight spoilers and slightly more ranting to follow.While absence may have made the hearts of some readers grow fonder it certainly has n't for me . A Dance with Dragons suffers from many of the same things as its predecessor A Feast for Crows . For one the length . Do n't get me wrong . I 'm not a lazy reader by any means . A thousand pages is not a daunting thing for me to read especially if I enjoy the story . But there are just too many words ! Martin really needs to learn to get to the point.For example I could care less about the extensive feast descriptions that pop up it seems once per chapter . See Mr. Martin I can do it tooThe table was covered end to end with dishes overflowing lamprey pies slowly congealing in the tepid air tender roast mutton whose meat looked like to drip off the bone tail of dog soup caramelized cranberry steak tartar blood pudding served with steaming buttered loaves of sour dough bread Dornish wine glittering in crystal decanters broiled pig stuffed with dates and walnuts food more food some more of that food we were talking about did I already mention food ? Well here 's some more let me describe it to you in exhaustive detail if you do n't believe meAnd five years later we get back to the story but I 've already forgotten what we were talking about . And now I 'm hungry . Awesome . I felt like I was reading a medieval Martha Stewart cookbook . I 'm sure some would call this overabundance of description details but I think it is unnecessary and something that hinders the progression of the plot . If you say that they 're having a feast or dinner or whatever Mr. Martin I believe you . I promise ! Now please use that page space for furthering the plot instead.I do n't have all negative things to say about ADwD . I do love the POV characters . Well okay . Most of them the ones that actually add to the story . But those oneoff fringe characters that easily could have been shafted from the final draft ? Those characters get on my nerves . Why waste a chapter on The Iron Suitor when I could read more of Arya or Jaime ? The POV characters who got significant face time in this book were thankfully very interesting although Tyrion is starting to wear out his welcome . I 've always been fond of Bran as a character so I really looked forward to reading his share of the chapters . I liked that Theon had his chance to shine and I do love reading about the Wall and the North through Jon 's POV.Here 's my main problem with the series however . No amount of clever wording surprisingly exciting but few and far between chapter installments or intriguing character development can mask the fact that not a lot has happened over the course of these five books . I feel like I 'm watching one of those television shows where each week they have some exciting selfcontained little adventure that adds absolutely nothing to the overarching plot.Argue with me all you want to the contrary I 'm sticking with that assessment . I 've been so blinded by the idea of this being an epic fantasy book series that I 've ignored the fact that there has been very little followthrough in that regard . This series has been overhyped . There I said it . It 's still a tremendous body of work sure but if Mr. Martin churns out hundreds of pages per installment and can only move the plot along at a snaillike pace maybe I 'm not getting enough bang for my buck and that disappoints me . I want this story to be worthwhile.And I want to see how this all ends . I do . But it 's going to be a wearisome struggle to get there . Is it really worth it ? ",1
"There is a terrific novel in here but like the last few books it is buried and strangled with the glacial pace and extraneous bits that clutter it up . Also like the last books there is no attempt to have a book that stands on it 's own with a beginning a middle and an end . We are left abruptly with no resolution to the story or most of the characters.Given the amazing breadth of plot and deep character development and the fabulous and richly fleshed out world that has been developed maybe I am being too picky ? But I feel as if some talented editor could go through and help make this much tighter and faster moving book . But while I am gripping about the pacing and lack of resolution there can be no question about the brilliance of the author 's creation . I am speechless with admiration about his willingness to brutally eliminate favorite characters in keeping with the nature of the world he has created which has allowed this series to avoid the boring predictability and tiredness that so many series fall into as the same lead characters have the same kinds of adventures over and over.I may be complaining but I am still hooked and at this point I am thinking we may never get typical book style character resolution . After all in real life there are no nice tidy resolutions and these characters and this world is more like looking down on what is happening in another world than reading a story ",3
"I waited a long time for this book to come out in paperback as I had the previous 4 books in Paperback . I 'm liking the story well enough but was disappointed to find flaws in the printing..complete blanking out of the words on a couple of pages . I was able to figure some out but did n't expect this . ",3
"George Martins series are outstanding . Could not put the book down . I ca n't wait for his next installment . The Game of Thrones series is even better when you read the books along with the HBO dvds . ",4
"Martin continues the saga with more characters more places more deaths more disappearances and more people seemingly resurrected from what appeared to be certain death . We still do n't know for sure where he intends to take us in the end or who will be alive to welcome us there . Very frustrating . ",2
"same as what everybody else said . this story would have made a great 5book series but at this point he 's just stringing us along for no good reason . there 's an art to writing an epic series like this and part of that is making each book feel both selfcontained and part of a whole at the same time . this one feels more like a placeholder . it 's a shame that there are so many plot lines here and that rather than move any particular character one foot forward he instead moves a dozen different characters forward an inch . ",1
"Ca n't wait until the next book . So much is happening and converging together in this world and so many unanswered questions . ",4
"I love this series of books . I do lose track of the characters at times since the book skips around a lot . Book 4 left two big cliff hangers and I could n't wait to dive into Book 5 . The hard covers are huge and pretty heavy so I was glad to get them on Kindle . I bought the whole series now because I need to go back and reread all the books . I wish sixth book was published because I just finished 5 . ",4
"I wish I could say it took me two weeks to finish this book because I was savoring it . After all I had been so excited that I preordered this book the first day I could . Heck I almost ordered it via the UK Amazon just so I could get it sooner but after the bad taste A Feast left in my mouth I was n't quite willing to shell out the big bucks that would have required.I was giddy with anticipation and having been reminded how good the series is by HBO I felt like a kid at Christmas when the UPS man dropped off my copy of A DanceTwo weeks and a thousand pages later George RR Martin has lost me as a reader . Never mind the five years the nine other books he published or edited between A Feast and A Dance or the slow paced unsatisfying novel that A Feast was . It would have been worth it had this book delivered . I would have gladly gone back to being the GRRM fanboy I was preaching the wonders that is his Song of Ice and Fire but no . I can't.Much has already been said about how long the book is . Its long and you feel every page . The words crawl by the plot and stories advance sluggishly at best and new characters are introduced to replace characters that have been killed off brought back and killed off again . The existing characters exist only as a backdrop to the history and turtles that GRRM wants to talk about . Only rather than telling those stories through characters plot lines and differing points of view he reduces characters such as Tyrion to disinterested third party narrators.Gone is the suspense missing is the magic and lost is the laser like focus of the first three books . It should say a lot that the most interesting plots in A Dance seem almost tacked on after thoughts to the story GRRM wanted to tell . Though rougher and less polished than the main storylines in the novel these other stories show flashes of brilliance and a return to storytelling that made GRRM great in the first place . Sadly though these stories are few and separated by hundreds of pages and dozens of chapters about nothing.More tragically its seems that GRRM has found his Wesley Crusher something he had managed to avoid doing or at least managed to avoid being eye stabbingly obvious about in his prior books . This is perhaps the biggest disappointment for me authors need to keep themselves and their Mary Sue 's out of their books.One last note and only because I have n't seen it mentioned in the other reviews . GRRM interjected quite a bit of his personal views and politics in both A Feast and A Dance . There is nothing wrong with this as such most authors do this without even realizing it . They project their world view upon a fictional world of their own making and its impossible for it not to happen . A Dance very much became a heavy handed and preachy vehicle for his politics . ",0
"Another star lost for excessive details . I feel like at some point I should really cut Martin a break but then again I think about how I put over forty hours into finishing this book and I completely change my mind . Story telling should n't move at a snail 's pace more than half the time . So here is the breakdown of events in this book . People get killed again for unfounded reasons and others most likely at the end of the book will seem to be killed but events in the next book will explain how that at the last second they were spared.I almost feel like Maritn does not know where to go with the story so he just creates some other conspiracy out of the blue to distract the reader for another four hundred pages . So if you are reading this review I take it most likely you are where I am with your reading of this compendium and there are things that just as I said do n't make sense . Some things happen and you just have to wonder why Martin would make the characters act a certain way for exampleWhere we left off with Forest Gump errrI mean Samwell Tarley this was in A Feast for Crows for some inexplicable reason before he left on a mission to Bravos he never told Jon Snow that his brothers were alive and well . Promise or no promise to Bran if you had a best friend and had knowledge that his younger halfbrothers were alive would n't you just tell him Hey do n't tell anyone else but your brothers are totally not dead . As Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch I think Jon could be trusted to keep mum.Anyway I do n't want to get in a lengthy spiel again about how the details are out of control again so I cut straight into my own theories about what will possibly happen insteadTheory I There are to be three Dragon Riders that constantly get mentioned . We have Dany and her cousin who had been thought to have been killed when he was a baby . Aegon so that leaves one more needed Rider Unless people or Dany just kills her dragon Drogon . Which I think she should do . I mean this dragon was killing kids and eating them . When a pet goes wild you have to put it down . I mean look what they did to Lady and Nimeria was the one that attacked Joeffrey . So anyway I think that Jon Snow is really a Targaryen . I think his father was Rhagar and Eddard promised his sister on her death bed that he would tell no one because he knew that Robert Baratheon would kill the child if he found out so he hid the child the only way he could by admitting that he had a marital indiscretion.Theory II In the end Tyrion will rule the Seven Kingdoms . I like this one just because it has a Lord of the Rings feel to it . Kinda like no matter how small even a dwarf can do amazing things and save the world.Theory III Eddard Stark is a greenseer and has really been alive this whole time and he wakes up in a pool of sweat and it 's all been a premonition dream and as he wipes his brow dry he says Winter is coming . close curtain .

"I hate these books as much as I love them . They go on and on and say nothing An interesting well loved character to me equals great reading a character I do n't like means pushing my way through many tedious pages of boredom . Martin is an OK writer but if he was a good writer the books could be half as long and say much more . I do n't understand why people think these books are great as they are simply tedious and at times very boring . Do n't waste your time trying to read this sluggish mess of words ",0
"What an amazing book . You can not assume to know what 's to happen next . You are always left guessing . Magic stuff ! ",4
"Martin is able to bring alot and kill off a lot of characters to life through his writings . He better write book 6 soon . ",4
"I am a very long time fan of Mr. Martin . I still hold up the first 3 books of this series as the greatest fiction I have ever read . Perhaps that is why the last 2 books have hurt so much . The first three books were gripping fun suspenseful shocking inspiring and on and on . This book just has none of that . It has taken characters we have grown to love and watered them down and made them very dull and in some cases very dumb . By the end of the book it seems the characters and the story is almost no further ahead than at the end of book 3 . Will I read the next book ? Yeahprobablyif for no other reason than I still have hopes that Mr. Martin can resurrect the drama of the first three . ",1
"Let 's get the main criticism out of the way yes yes A Dance With Dragons in many respects is far too long and far too slow . This book is not nearly as taut as George R. R. Martin 's magnificent A Game of Thrones but instead is eerily reminiscent of the halfbakedyet1200pageslong draft that Michael Douglas is working on at the beginning of Wonder Boys . I often felt like his insightful student who reluctantly tells Douglas Sure it 's beautifully written but it 's like you did n't have the courage to make any choices.But here 's the thing . Now that he 's into the fifth book of A Song of Ice and Fire Martin has realized that he 's created a unique fully realized world that has a dizzying cast of characters . Unlike Tolkien the inevitable comparison once again rears its ugly head Martin has decided to put everything into this series he 's not going to finish these seven books and then unleash a Silmarillionlike collection of back stories and supporting myths . He 's created this world by gum and he 's going to let us wallow in its glorious bloody miseries and triumphs.And wallow we do . The first two thirds of the book bring back some favorite characters who were frustratingly absent from Book 4 A Feast For Crows . Tyrion Lannister flees to the East after murdering his father at the end of Book 3 A Storm of Swords . Ever the plotter Tyrion aims to join forces with Daenerys Targaryen the dragon queen whose dreams of reconquering Westeros are thwarted by the troubles she 's made for herself in Meereen after freeing the slaves . Daenerys must also confront the harsh fact that her beloved three dragons are not responding well to city life . Daenerys faces innumerable political challenges in a world where political issues are often solved with blood or poison . Jon Snow still commands the Watch at the Wall but faces his own mess of devil 's choices . Bran Stark continues his journey toward becoming a mystical seer . Theon Greyjoy endures the harshest of tortures at the hands of Ramsay Bolton but at Winterfell must maintain an obvious lie for political purposes . Arya Stark stays on the path to assassinhood in Braavos . . . and on and on . The last third of the novel reconnects with the action in the South as we get brief glimpes through the eyes of Jaime Cersei and Kevan Lannister and a few others.At the end of the novel A Song of Ice and Fire is teed up for some mighty clashes and highstakes political wheeling and dealing . Could Martin have written a much shorter book to get to the same point ? Of course he could have . But the point is A Song of Ice and Fire is an epic story perhaps the most epic in the history of high fantasy . He is not writing books that can be easily enjoyed on an airplane flight and then discarded . These are books that are meant to be savoured and devoured . My perfect ASOIAF reading experience would most likely involve a quiet room with massive maps on my walls and a character compendium at my side so I could refresh my recollection as to just who the heck the Martells are or the role of the Sand Snakes and why the Boltons and Tullys matter . I have n't forgotten these details because these folks are n't interesting it 's just they 've been offstage for too long . For me that 's a strength of Martin 's books not a weakness.Eventually this epic will be so vast that anyone who can keep it all straight should receive an honorary PhD . We need more series like this but I fear that Martin 's creation is a onceinageneration affair . ",4
"I enjoyed Dance . I suppose the story did n't move as far as I would have liked but it was expected following A Feast for Crows.I enjoyed all the POV 's excluding the Frog Prince.I think all George 's chess pieces are aliened to bring 2 powerful and rereadable installments to the Song of Ice and Fire series now that the last 2 are out of the way.I love the series and this book did not hinder that ! ",2
"I was entertained . I would give 4.5 stars if possible . It was not as thrilling as the first three but for someone following the series I think there was a lot of development and character building . While I would not be so willing to kill off a character unless it really serves the plot line I will just enjoy Martin 's writing without questioning his motives . After all the story is not done yet and who but the author knows how one event may have a pivotal significance on the next part of the story . Some of the surprises did n't shock me but seemed a bit out of place or timed a bit peculiarly . In consideration of the enormous size of the book I 'm talking about a couple of minutes worth of events out of a very long story . I think the moments that felt like huh did that really just happen ? left me just a tiny bit irritated with the events rather than shocked at certain deaths . I am hoping that the deaths enhance the story somehow . Also there was no suspenseful build up before these certain events happened and that is why they may have seemed out of place . They were abrupt and one or two of them seemed a bit pointless or perhaps destructive to future components of the story . Other than those things the book was an amazing piece of narration and storytelling which I found highly entertaining . I find the three star reviews a bit silly since they were probably based mostly on angry responses to a few events towards the end of the book the ones that I just mentioned but took with a grain of salt . Since I have no intention of writing any other spoilers that 's it for my review . It was a good continuation to the story well narrated in the audio version and excellent for a long daily commute . ",4
"This book is a continuation of the previous and just does n't end ! Rather disappointing but always room for more to follow ! ",3
"Please tell me this not the end . I believe I need more . There are too many loose ends . The Dragon 's need to come back . ",2
"Enjoyable as always . People craving resolution will be disappointed though there are few answers here and many more questions . Essential to those following the series but I would n't recommend it if you have n't read the preceding books . ",3
"I do love A Song of Ice and Fire but I ca n't help but feel like George RR is pulling us around at this point ! Ultimately I just have a lovehate relationship with the books but lean more toward love . ",2
"The series is still so goodwhen does book 6 come out ? ? ? ? ? Like all the rest the most ridiculous stuff happens in the last 200 pages . ",3
"This book was better than than a feast for crows but still no where near the caliber of the first 3 . It seems the plot will become much more interesting in the coming books but it could be years before we get those . ",2
"The first three were somewhat tiresome but worth reading for the verisimilitude and feel of being there and involved in the plot and the ACTION . I should have known with volume four to quit while I was barely ahead . Now no action except when the author thinks he has just about put you to sleep . The dwarf 's humor has even grown trite and banal . Now there are only words and words and words and even more words put together in no particularly pleasing order . When he killed off yet another Stark Snow in a matter of half a page to no good purpose I almost threw the book at the wall . You sold us out Mr. Martin most sagas are supposed to have an aim and an end . You are NOT a Tolkien . You have made your pile of money now please go enjoy it somewhere rather than destroy your reputation and our reading pleasure further . Shame shame shame ! Seth Aragon ",0
"such a good read Martin continues his tale and there are many wonderful parts that happen and he leaves you on so many cliff hangers you 'll be anxious for him to release the 6th book . ",4
"I will not suffer the Jordan Syndrom twice in my life ! I will watch the show on HBO for the next 20 years to see how this ends . ",0
"No soft cover book available maybe someday the book industry will care about fans of books and actually release the softcover at initial release so people that do not like hard cover can actually share in the story.. ",0
"If you 're a fan of GRRM and the Song of Ice and Fire series this book will not disappoint . Is it slow as reviewers prior to me have stated ? Yes at times . Does it focus on several characters for most of the book ? Yes it does . I believe GRRM knows where he 's going and the reduction in characters and narrowing of focus is on purpose . Things are starting to come together plotwise . This book reminded me of how Sanderson brought focus to the Wheel of Time series after it slowed down and the plot became too multithreaded . If you think you knew Tyrion and Danaerys and Jon before this book well you will get to know them even better . To sum it up I enjoyed the book very much . It 's not as fastpaced as previous installments and there are n't as many momentous events in the book but true fans of the series will think the investment well worth your time and $ . ",3
"Boy I ca n't believe all the complaining about the unresolved issues in this book . We all knew it was n't going to be the last in the series . Middle books are just that the middle of the story . I do n't think Martin has ever flogged his stuff as standalone . Look at all the unresolved issues at the end of The Two Towers . Anyhow I for one am very grateful for 1000 pages of high entertainment . Will we have to wait 7 years for the next one ? Who knows who cares ? There are a lot of other great books out there to read in the meantime.I think this book was just as good as any of the first 4 . That said I kind of knew what to expect this time which was n't the case when I was wowed by the Red Wedding or Ned 's beheading in the first book . Let 's face it we 've all begun to expect something shocking and new from Martin . Well his prior stuff has really run the gamut and it just is n't as easy to be shocked by character deaths after a certain point . Which does n't make them any less interesting to me.There are too many story threads for the reader to experience for me to summarize them and who wants to read my summary anyhow . Suffice it to say that the writing is just as top drawer and the characters and the dialogue and.. and . Well it 's a great book . I look forward to the next one whenever it comes . ",4
"Right out of the gate let me say that I hated hated hated book 4 AFFC but respected the author 's work enough to give it three stars plus the fact that I hated it because of its left turn away from characters I cared about is telling I still care I guess . So while I guess I hate this one less because we 've turned back again it gets 2 stars because honestly while I still respect GRRM 's way with words I am utterly disillusioned with his ability to control them in creating context any longer.Let 's just cut to the chase GRRM did n't have to create two books out of one what he had to do was let his editing staff cut out the trenchers of filler and get back to the meat of a very very good story . Alas words are n't just wind they 're also cold hard cash.But GRRM expecting us to buy that these two books just had to be published separately is somewhat of an insult to the intelligence of his readership . ",1
"I am in book 4 of the series and I am disappointed . The first time the author killed of a character I had come to love I was in shock . Okay I recovered and kept reading . The next time the author killed off a leading character I was disappointed but accepted it as central to the story . But now I am tired of what I consider a needless massacre of pertinent people central to the story line . I could not put book one down . I was excited to get into book two . By book three my interest was slowing down and here I am in book four and I have not picked it up in three days . I think the author overreached . This story has hundreds of characters and while having them listed in the back of the book has helped still it 's overwhelming . And why is there no mention on any of the maps as to where the Narrow Sea is located ? I am disappointed overall . I do n't even know if I am going to purchase book five . Something has to happen in book four to capture me before I buy any more of the story . ",2
"back on track and really enjoyed the development of the stories . was more than a bit gutted by the ending though ",3
"This series is an amazing swim in the deep end of the ocean where the big boys play . This plot has so many levels that I have no idea what will really happen next ! Every time I think I know whats happening and going to happen . I find I am WRONG ! I LOVE IT ! I need more ! This writing is crack for readers ! ",4

The author chose to split the last installment into two books taking certain characters to a particular point in book four and the remaining characters to the same point and then a little further in book five . Consequently there was an overlap in book five where the storyline included events that we had already experienced in book four . I felt it was a detriment to the story line but it eventually worked out and despite that I thoroughly enjoyed the ride . The characters are incredible and no one is safe ! ! I ca n't wait til book six arrives . I hope Mr. Martin is working diligently . ",4
"Regardless of whether the narrative is enjoyable the accompanying maps are totally illegible in Kindle too small light and blurry . Especially since much of the action takes place in the East a lack of a good map is a serious handicap . ",1
"There 's too much exposition and too many newly introduced characters in books 4 and 5 at least for my taste . Also too many long boring passages that may go somewhere sometime but take too long to do so . I 'm not even a third of the way through and have already moved on to another unrelated book . I 'll return to Dragons but am not sure when . Someone said it gets better near the end but oh the tedium to get there ! ",2
"The complexity of the story lines continue to grow . An ever expanding cast of characters who move through a complex world . Rich in detail and full of the most amazing twists and turns . ",4
"I completely enjoyed this newest book by George Martin . It was a total page turner and I was sad when it ended . ",4
"I 'm losing interest in many of the story lines but there were some nuggets in this book . I still love Jon Snow . I love the dragons and the dragon queen . My desire not to see the words c & ck or T & ats over and over has deepened.I want more nuggets ! ",2
"It is entirely possible that Martin either did NOT write the first 3 books or did not write the last 2 booksthe notion that the same person wrote all 5 is impossible . We could henpeck all the inconsistencies in style and tone and talent but there 's really no point . If you 're a fan you know something 's wrong.I 've read other stuff by Martin and it 's pretty decent . Fever Dream being on of my favorite vampire books I 'd say the guy has some talent in writing . That said NONE of his other books come close the the complexity and moxie of SOIAF . I have theories as to why the first three books are not in the same league as the last two . If you 'd like to discuss the conspiracies please comment here and a message will be sent to my hotmail account . My username here is name I use for my email as well.Is George RR Martin part of one of the largest literary consipiracies since George Eliot ? ? Let 's explore the possibilities together . ",0
"I 'm not sure why but I thought Book 5 was the end of the Series . Unfortunately when you start off thinking that you keep wondering when the story is going to tie up the loose end only to realize it DOES N'T ! My own fault I guess but not my favorite book in the Series . I 'm not sure it added all that much value to the story line if it did I missed it ! ",2
"Long but good ! It has taken me a long time to finish and not the ending I expected . Enjoyed the read ",4
"I actually got an autographed copy of A Dance With Dragons . GRRM came to the Tattered Cover in Denver for a book signing . I could n't actually make it to the signing but was able to request an autographed copy . The next time I was in Denver I picked it up and held it lovingly afraid to mar the beautiful silver cover . As soon as I got back home I started reading expecting to devour the thing in one sitting okaymay be 2 ! much like I did the last Harry Potter book . I had my glass of water and plenty of snacks to sustain me during the hardcore reading expedition . I opened the book expecting to be blown away by Martin 's genius gasping at the twists and turns reveling in people getting their comeuppance you know all the things we have grown to love from Song of Ice and Fire.It actually took me MONTHS to get through Dance With Dragons something that has never happened to me with any of the other books of the series even considering that I 've read through the first four about seven times EACH ! I never skip entire pages nor leave the book sitting forgotten on the side of the couch collecting dust ! NEVER ! The only thing that kept me going was the hope that SOMETHING would happen something important or exciting or dramatic . Talk about being left wanting . As I read this I got the feeling that Martin had lost complete control of his story and that he was simply filling pages with unnecessary descriptions and such to try to hide the fact that the essential parts of Dance With Dragons could be boiled down to probably something more along the lines of a novella.I 'm sure I 'll read the next book of the series but I wo n't be on the edge of my seat . I may even wait and check it out from the library something I NEVER do with favorite books . I love buying them and having them on my shelf to read over and over again . ",0
"I have read all the books in A Song of Ice and Fire three times over . Just like watching your favorite movie over and over again you will always stumble across something that you missed the first time . Martin is a wicked genius ! ",4
"As usual Mr. Martin provides us with so much intrigue mystery twists and action one can hardly put it down . I 'm so entrenched it saddens me to come to the end of the completed series I can only hope the next book will not be too long in coming . ",4
"I liked this one just as much as the others in the series . If you like the other books or the show you 'd probably enjoy this one . ",4
"Very much enjoyed this book more than the last . Can not wait until the next book comes out . Great read . ",4
"Keeps your intrest . I thought I would get tired of reading these but I have read all and am just finishing the last book . hope he writes another . ",4
"I bought the series after seeing the movie on cable ! This some of the best fiction since Dune and The Dark Tower ! You 'll love this series ! ",4
"This is where the series becomes really interesting . Loved it and I would read it again . Ca n't wait for the next book ! ",4
"I did not start reading this series until book four was finished . This one was as great as the first . I can not wait until the next one is published . I hope I do n't have too long to wait otherwise I may have to reread the 1st four again.The Game of Throne ought to be included in high school or college literature classes . ",4
"I read the first four books at rapid speed as I was enthralled by the story . The writing is very good and satisfying to those who like well constructed prose . Then I began Dance and started to get annoyed . The story does not move forward . It gets stuck and becomes disjointed as Martin jumps from one character scenario to another . I felt as if the author was not sure where he wanted to take the story and got lost in giving us deeper details about the characters . Also I got personally angry about his killing off all my favorite characters especially Jon Snow . And leaving Araya at loose ends not to mention what was up with her mother . This book seemed to me to be a stop gap for the author as if he is treading water while he figures out how to bring the saga back to life . But who can wait so long for Martin to get it together . I for one am moving on . ",1
"Riveting ! I 'm waiting for his next book to find out what happens to characters in this one . He does know how to write them ! ",3
"Well my review title is just a little bit of a nonspoiler which may make sense if you decide to read this book.What can I tell you that has n't been said ? Not much.There are moments when you can feel the old GRRM at work in this novel but not many . It is indeed in need of a grand editing . And my sense is that both of the last two books penned by Martin would have made one 1200 masterpiecehad anyone bothered to edit them down.It is true that most nothing happens in Dance of Dragons . A little does . But not much that you will care about . Still I did n't want it to end because as Martin would have itit starts to get interesting at the END ! ! ! lolI 'm not quite sure what happened here . Really I 'm not . I felt bad when I read all the abuse that Martin receives from fans for not writing fast enough . Well now you can abuse him for not writing well enough.The criticisms espoused by the multitude of fans on Amazon are sadly correct . It is not the worst book ever written but its just not very good . It 's missing all of the blood and fire of the first 3 with glimmers in the 4th . What it 's really missing areHEROESor at least our character behaving as such . And gone is the intrigue mystery and action that we come to expect from GRRM . Sure there is a little here or there if midgets riding pigs is your thing.This should have been the winner to take back the crown for Martin but despite the moronically positive critical reviews the fans know that this book can not touch the first 3.Luckily since nothing bloody well happens except for people shuffling about there is still room for Martin to save this series with the next 2 I guess 3 books.I predict that he will do this but will not manage to capture the spirit of the first 3.If any of you are James Clavell fans you might remember his atrocious novel Whirlwind . Well this is Martin 's Whirlwind and sad to say it will be at least 35 years before you get another one and most likely a lot longer.Is it better than nothinganswer NO . Next time I 'll take nothing . ",1
"I 'm still every bit enamored with the series as I have been since the first book and will gobble up every bit of story George Martin throws my way but with this most recent entry I finally felt the pangs of impatience and vehemently wished that Martin could go back and capture some of that brilliant narrative pacing he pulled off in book # 3 and reinject that energy back into the series . PS the Daenerys storyline is starting to bug ! ",2
"I am glad I waited to start reading this series until after A Dance with Dragons released . That said now I will go insane waiting until the sixth and purported finale to this fantastic epic is published . This is by far the most detailed science fiction fantasy story since and dare I say more human though sometimes vile and exciting even than the great Tolkien epic Lord of the Rings . ",4
"Great book would highly recommend the whole series every character I like has died but it makes for good reading ",3
"Great book in the series . It was everything I expected and more . Love this author . His fantasy world is his own and the characters in it are flawed just like people in the real life which of course makes it a great read . Now the wait is on for number six . ",4
"Well if you 've read Game of Thrones up to this point you already know what has transpired . Either you 're spitting mad or laughing maniacally with the knowledge of what has happenedand most likely what is to come.Regardless this book partially runs alongside Book 4 in regards to the storyline and then finishes with a grand push forward at the end with a whole host of cliff hangers to run headlong into Book 6 . I can not give any spoilers in case you read this review before finishing the first four books but each and every character will face their own trials and make decisions which will help them on their way to the Iron Throneor put them in shallow graves next to those who tried before them.The North Remembers ",4
"This Series is amazing ! I wish all books could be written this well and all twists this dramatic . Good thing they are n't though or I would never get anything done . Everyone should read this series ! EVERYONE ! ",4
"I would recommend Dance with Dragons because it continues the story line of The Song of Ice and Fire . It left me with many unanswered questions which hopefully will be answered with the next series . ",4
"I just finished DoD and I truly feel like it was a waste of time . I loved the first 3 books thankfully I read the reviews about a Feast of Crows and was n't too disappointed by the fact that a lot of the characters I had invested in were no where in the book . I also read the reviews for this book and bought it and skimmed skimmed skimmed oh read about Theon skimmed skimmed read a bit about Arya skimmed over all the useless filler no forward moving dialogue ugh just boring ! What happened ? How could the first 3 books be SO GOOD and the last 2 so poor ? ",1
"I ca n't wait to read the series conclusionwhenever George gets around to finishing it . Which I think is his point He 's had so much fun torturing the characters and his audience that he 's just going to draw the suspense out until we all go nuts . ",4
"I can not get enough of this series . Come on book six and sevenThis book is the other half of A Feast For Crows book 4 with the other characters ' views . Some scenes are even duplicated from the other perspective . A total joy to read . ",4
"Six years is a long time to wait for the second half of A Feast for Crows because that is what this book is . Martin 's previous book became so huge that he literally cut out half the chapters covering half the characters and pushed them into this book . Thus this story covers the same timeline as the previous more or less just from another viewpoint . More on that in half a hand of minutes but first the reason I am still reading this series.George Martin does imagine a intricate and sometimes quite delicious set of intrigues . A cast of characters that seems to put Tolstoy to shame and a sweeping political situation mixed with injustices and wrongdoing that make the reader long to see favourite characters avenged . Martin does know how to weave a remarkable story and that is surely the secret of his considerable success.Neverthless should we think for half a minute there are certain things that really let this book down . There were times reading this book that I simply sighed and put it down and each time my inclination to pick up the book was reduced.Stylistically certain phrases are so overused in this book that they have reached the point of immense distraction . I am tempted to find the etext of the book and count how many times half a is used . Certainly it was not unusual to find the phrase twice in a single paragraph . Do the people of Westeros not have the word fifty and thus need to say half a hundred instead ? Other phrases like words are wind were put in entirely too many mouths and just reminded me that it was just one author writing all these dialogues.Assuming that annoyance is just me there are other problems . The most important is this story has become incredibly slow . This book and the last are filled with so much clever dialogue character development internal monologue and other page filling material that there was precious little space left for action.This is not helped by the multiple point of views used . Each chapter is told from a different character 's point of view and the timeline goes back and forth as each character is given page upon page of development . All in all this is a text book example of a story that is totally overwritten.Then there is the world the story is set in Westeros is just another faux medieval land with swords sorcery not much of that mind dragons and knights and really nothing to distinguish it from the great raft of Tolkienesque literature except the lack of elves and the number of pages.What really did it for me though was the incessant crudity and vulgarity . Some people will like that in this book I suppose . They will say this is a more earthy tale than Tolkien 's . For me thoughthis book contains probably my most disliked passage I have ever read . I presume the author 's intent was to make the character involved seem seedy and base and to his credit he succeeded in spades . I am no prude when it comes to books but I do n't want to read this and this will be my last Martin book . I presume it will be another 6 years before the next in the series if we all live that long but when it comes I do not intend to buy it.This is not a series I can recommend anymore . The author has lost his way and the early promise is coming to nothing . I wonder if I have correctly predicted the end but I find I no longer really care.Two stars because despite my dropping this series I do think the author has produced some good story here . If you can be bothered to wade through all the overwritten stuff you may find half a hundred reasons to enjoy it.Finally a note on the audio version of the book . This is extremely hard on the ear beause the narrator has a tendency to . Punctuate mid sentence.Every single sentences seems . To contain punctuation to interrupt the thought.I do admire the narrator 's ability with accents but his femal voices all just sound daft . ",1
"Much better George . Much much better ! ' A Dance with Dragons ' is a redemption of sorts from Martin 's last book ' A Feast for Crows . It starts off a little slow but then gets a lot more exciting as it progresses . Martin still tells a lot more than he shows and when he shows sometimes he shows too much but at least here he practices some restraint . The editing is tighter and the prose is much stronger . Best of all there 's a lot more action and it involves my favorite characters . I was surprised by a few things but overall there were no shocking twists . I am concerned about one character in particular . I ca n't see how the story can go on without this particular character but I guess I 'll just have to wait and see . The strength of this series is that you have no idea if the characters you love will make it and I really appreciate that Martin is n't playing favorites with any character even the popular ones.Overall this is a good read . Not the best in the series but definitely not the worst . I have renewed hope for this story now and I really wish he would hurry up and write the next one ! flag ",3
"While I agree with some reviewers that the story does plod along very slowly in this book I was still at all times invested in the story and overall enjoyed the book very much . GRRM is capable of holding the interest of a reader through the heavy use of dialogue little action and very little plot development . Similar to the previous books in the series there are stages in the book where very little happens yet I still feel compelled to read further to find out what is in store for my favourite characters as there was always something to tweak my interest.As before each chapter centres around a certain character but towards the end the separate stories are beginning to merge and I hope that signals that some characters will be teaming up again in the near future . One minor complaint may be the increasing number of characters who are sometimes hard to keep track of . However the attention to detail and the fleshing out of each character in their own right is indeed masterful and makes one willing to forgive the ever growing task of keeping track of these due to the enjoyment I found in getting to know them . I believe this is one of the reasons you become invested and engrossed in a slowpaced book since you live yourself into the story thanks to the immersive writing style.Be warned that as in previous stories GRRM is not afraid to kill off characters which I find refreshing since the story is not predictable and the reader is never assured that a main protagonist is safe . And once again as in previous ventures the story accelerates sharply near the end with many cliffhangers which will surely keep readers coming back for more.I look forward to reading the conclusion in this epic series . ",3
"I love all the books however if I had known they were going to be as drawn out as they are I would of opted to waitWaiting for years for another book is just not acceptable to me I do n't like how he just leaves a character and never talks about him again for a whole book . I loved the dwarf and never heard anything else and I have to wait for other characters as well I 'm sure it is making him a lot of money but it does not do well for my frustration I read the first five books in eight days devouring them . I need and want more and sooner not later . ",4
"Jon Snow 's decision to feed the wildlings rather than simply burn the bodies of the ones who starve ruins what could have been a promising turnaround in the story . ",1
"This book and the last were a drag . This author needs some serious editing ! Seems like he is getting lost in the descriptive part of the narrative and the thrust and direction are too diluted by far . Also we are running out of original protagonists and I find myself becoming detached from the characters . There are only two I care about any more and it is getting hard to wade through pages and pages of descriptive nothingness to keep up with them . Not sure I will continue with the series . I feel kind of abused ! ",1
"Great book . Possibly evil author . If you are a fan of HBO 's Game of Thrones and wondering if you should read the books I highly recommend that you pull your head out of your arse and get started . Be warned though as George RR Martin forces his readers to sit the Iron Throne and feel every barb and cut the characters feel . The character development in this series is outstanding the world building is amazing and the range of emotions you will feel is only limited by your imagination . ",4
"I confess to purchasing only due to my 16 yr old 's badgering . However after discussing aspects of the books they sound interesting and very complicated . ",4
"Enjoyed the book I think it was a good addition to the series and helps to advance the story line . Additionally it arrived in a timely manner from Amazon so thank you Amazon ",4
"Son has enjoyed this book series . He recommends this book to readers . Plot is great and said ending was awesome ! ",4
"Love Game of Thrones and Book Five does n't let you down ! Such a breath of fresh air after wading through Book Four . ",4
"So if you 've read the first three excellent novels and managed to suffer through the fourth than I do recommend a Dance with Dragons . The book is definitely not to the standards of the first three but it is much more exciting and fun then the dreadful 4th book in the series . The pacing can be quite slow and it appears that there are several throw away chapters and characters but one can only assume that GRRM is building toward something great for the next two books . The crap in the middle of the series can be painful to suffer through though . 2000 pages I 've read that I 'll never get back . That being said with the bad there is much good in this book . There are some characters you really enjoy hearing about and some that you love to hate . For some reason I really started to find Tyrion annoying in this book while he was fun in the other books . I guess that is just his character progression but I do n't think I like it.It is also very frustrating that the books are coming out at a snails pace and I do n't have the patience to reread these books once every five years or so . So if you you 've invested the time already PLEASE GET IT . Its a great series with lots of potential for the future but you 've just started the series I would wait until it is complete before investing the time and money . ",3
"SpoilerThis is for those who Read itDid anyone else but me look at this book when they got it and thinkWow..I 'm gon na have a lot to read And then when it was finished think..Now what did I just read ? Its a huge book yes . You 'll be reading for a while . BUT its mostly words words words ! Nothing major happens..When Tyrion was in the Sarrows I was thinking finally his story is going to pick up . And then it fell flat . Daenerys story was mostly boringAnd even when she FINALLY flew on a dragon its was close to the end of her story and then its nothing major..Yep she flew a dragonNo Targaryen ansestry blood of the dragon running through her veins stuff . Ugh..And then there is Jon . Yep his story was a bore too . So he gets stabbed at the end but who cares . Ghost where are you Ghost . And the other characters I 'm not even going to go there because I did n't even like them.When this series started it was epic..The first 3 were like nothing ever written . But now It just feels like its being drawn out to much and to many details that do n't need to be in there . GRRM has talent . I 'd just like to see him get it back on track.So I guess I 'm stuck here for the next 10 years waiting on the next one . And of course I 'll read it . ",2
"This is an amazing story continued . The world grows and the author remains faithful . Events are unfolding and there are still surprises . Minus 1 star however bc of too much description and not enough meat to the immense length of this book . Yes I 'm frustrated w some of the characters and what is happening in many parts of the world but since this is still a work in progress I can not judge it until it is complete . I just hope it ends well whatever 'well ' means in this series . To be honest I started skimming during much of the last 3rd of the book . I did n't do that at all with the first 4 books . I started wanting more definitive actions and answers and felt irritated by the lack of it . I 'm ready for closure now and hope to see it sooner than later . ",3
"Well written and well thought out it was truly a pleasure reading . Twists and turns that will leave you wondering how you never saw them coming . Ca n't wait to read the next . ",4
"This was a truly great new book in the Game of Thrones series especially after the lackluster A Feast for Crows the 4th book . While not much happened at least with our favorite chabracters in A Feast for Crows in A Dance with Dragons we see alot of Tyrion Jon Snowand Danyerys Theon etc though not enough of Jamie Lannister . And while there are n't any slow parts in this book at many times while reading it I thought to myself wow not only is this guy a great fantasy writer he is a great writer in general bloody brilliant . So far 4 of the 5 Game of Thrones books could be considered works of art . The only tough thing is waiting a long time till they come out . As it is A Dance with Dragons has inspired me to loop back around to the beginning of the series to revisit how the characters were at the beginning of their journey . At any rate look out book number six here come the Others ! ",4
"The author GRRM owes his fans an apology for releasing this terrible book . The most popular reviews pretty much cover it . 1000 pages of poorly written squat.I could have lived with the lack of plot progression but I did n't even enjoy the pages as I turned them . It was a painful marathon that ended by simply running out of pages.GRRM 's quality of writing is clearly not present . As others remarked it 's like the trainwreck of Jordan all over again . Lines repeated over and over until you want to scream . Having to chew through endless pages of describing foolish things like food . Way too many plot threads and nothing happening during any of them . Rich characters suddenly becoming twodimensional to the point of being corny e.g . Gee whiz I 'm just a knight I can only fight gee golly I sure could never be deceptive . Shucks . I actually grew to hate reading certain characters ' chapters.I waited eagerly on this book for years as many of you have . This one was so bad that I no longer eagerly await the next book and deem the series to likely end poorly.To go from such greatness to this drivel is a disappointment . If I ever buy another GRRM book it will be used to ensure the author makes no money off it . He will have to redeem himself before seeing another penny of mine.I would mail my copy of this turd back to him if I knew his address so that it would not waste space in my trashbin . ",1
"Totally got caught up in the series on HBO so much that I decided I could n't wait to see what happened in the next season ! ! ! I 've read all but Tyrion 's Witticisms and plan on reading that too eventually and now I 'm waiting on the next book and watching the fourth season on HBO ! It 's funny too by having faces to go with names I thought I was watching a rerun when the first episode aired this season 042014 because it was all just as I remembered seeing it when I read that particular and subsequent episodes ! Well at least it 's that way for me ! Love love love this series and as usual the book is much more detailed than the episodes aired on TV ! ! ! I 've reviewed all of the Game of Thrones books and copied and pasted this review since I 'd rather not go into detailed spoilers ! ! ! Great read you ca n't go wrong if you like story lines with Kings Queens castles giants mysterious creatures yet to be totally revealed and last but surely NOT the least DRAGONS ! ! ! ! ! Along with a riveting story..did I mention it 's a great read ? ! ! ! ",4
"I love the series and ca n't wait to read the last two books . This is my least favorite book in the series . This definitely could have been combined with crows . It is full of so much nothing and uninteresting conversation . The Danaerys character seems to be focus of this book and she is boring as ever . I really hope GRRM keeps her in east with her dragons or kill her off . The Westeros story line and the north need to be focused on and complete . ",0
"Really ? Others here have summed up my sentiments in fabulous detail so I will just say if you just have to read more of this story you 'll enjoy the book . If you are looking for resolution completion or the storyline to pick up.well that is n't going to happen . I just do n't need a list of 200 characters that mean nothing to me nor do I want to keep jumping around the countryside without an end game . Story lines are too broken seem to be forgotten or lost and serously I am too ! I feel a little ripped offlike I got pulled into an amazing series and then the author decided to just keep writing but forgot where he was going or that there needs to be an ending soon . But by now all the characters worth following are deadabsentor just doing strange unrelated things.Wake me when it 's over which I guess will be in another 5 years from now . Oh hummmm . ",1
"I have always been hesitant to read fantasy books because of their reputation of being long and overly detailed but the Game of Thrones Series has received such high praises that I decided to give it a try . Boy was I pleasantly surprised when I read the first three books ! They were quite good and moved along at such a pace that I could n't put them down . Unfortunately then came the fourth book A Feast of Crows which was quite a slog to get through . I told myself that is okay . Every writer has an off book . Then came this bookand was saddened that nothing has changed.A Dance with Dragons has proved to be just as slow and monotonous as the Feast of Crows with the story barely limping along . The story has just become too unwieldly with too many pages spent on repetitive internal character development and on other characters that have little to no impact with the overall story . A much better book could have been made by combining this book with the fourth book and editing everything down to around 1000 pages . I hate to say it but I suspect that the only reason to keep these two books separate might be greed . Why write one book when you can write two and fill it with repetitive catchphrases and characters saying the same thing over and over ? It also disheartening that Martin has also released a short story book set in Westeros . Great ! More characters and a chance to cash in ! It seems like you could skip every other character 's chapters and not lose anything.To get an idea of the scope of the story I painstakingly counted the characters listed in the appendix and came up with a whopping 935 characters . Assuming that each book is about 1000 pages long some shorter and some longer that averages to about one character introduced every five pages ! It has come to the point that when a character is introduced I do n't have the energy anymore to try to remember their name . Having to read a book by using a wiki numerous times is not enjoyable.Although I really liked the first three books I 'm not sure I would have even bothered knowing what I know now . With Martin taking many years between books I am starting to wonder whether this story will ever have an ending or whether it will go on and on for as long as possible so that Martin can milk as much money out of it . If you have n't started the series I would recommend that you do n't even start . ",1
"I have been reading this series since 1997 and it almost pains me to say that this book is not worthy of the first three.The fourth book Feast for Crows received a good review from me based on the assumption that Martin would follow his original plan and focus on the characters we care most about in Dance.He betrayed that idea . Dance only follows Dany and Jon for a limited amount of time and it introduces several characters that no one cares about because we do n't know them . The book was a waste of time and money and it may have kept me from finishing the series.Martin is receiving undeserved rave reviews for this book from critics based on the fact that he has a television show . Anyone who has been reading Martin for a while knows that this book is a colossal failure compared to his previous work . If you are not hellbent on finishing this series leave it alone . ",1
"I have been a fan of George R.R . Martin since 1996 . The first three books were amazing and probably the best three fantasy books I have ever read . Those books were fantasy stories for adults told by an adult who could write beautiful prose.No one builds a world like Martin . No one . His descriptive abilities are second to none and his characters are usually just as rich and vibrant.The fourth book A Feast for Crows was the inevitable clunker that seems to plague nearly every series.As I read A Dance with Dragons I caught glimpses of the first three books in the series but in the end it turned out to be more like the midseries clunker . Only it was worse.If you like descriptive prose that is sometimes beautiful this book is worth four stars . Martin goes way overboard on the descriptions but that is a fantasy author 's right to a great degree.On the story side the book is worth one star . It never came close to actually recapturing the brilliance of the first three books in the series it just gave hints at that lost brilliance . I would have given the book 2.5 stars if it were possible on Amazon but since it is not and since I value story over technical writing ability I went with the lower whole star.The plot flies apart in Dance . New characters are introduced out of nowhere and old friends are relegated to the woodpilemaybe to be revived later who knows nowdays lol . There is no resolution to be found only more questions and more frustrations.A good book even in a series usually has a beginning a middle and an end . Dance felt like almost pure middle with tiny portions of beginning and end mixed in . Those portions were too small for a book of this length at this point in a series.As far as the series goes I am among Martin 's oldest fans since I have purchased every book within a month of release . I do n't like the pace at which he writes and to be fair I do n't understand some of his public relations efforts . However I have always loved his writing . I was willing to forgive the clunker that was A Feast for Crows but my hopes were dashed in A Dance with Dragons.I want the old Martin with that rare mix of beautiful prose and adept story telling .

"The guy just ca n't put a period on it ! Another 1000 pages and all you get is some more new characters and no satisfaction with the ones and there are a lot ! you already know . ",2
"It is not that the book is bad persay it is just full of frivolous side plots useless ponderings and pointless details . This would be tolerable if he published one of these a year but he does n't . The end effect is you wait five years for half a story that is 950 pages long . Every story line ended with a cliff hanger and no resolution was reached for anyone or anything . It was like he got tired of writing with 50 pages to go and said f it they can find out in the next book . I suppose we will now need to wait another five years to find out who lives and who dies 2 different characters which army wins the battle 3 different armies and if the lost characters return 1 character . For those of you keeping track at home that is 6 story lines that were left as cliff hangers.I genuinely liked this series at first . But each book seems to get worse . Not that the plot is bad or the characters are n't compelling but to get to those gems you have to wade through pages and pages of drivel . Mr. Martin please I beg you by the old gods and the new hire a good editor and heed their advice . ",0
"This brings out the inner sci fi dork in me . I love the entire series . Have been watching the HBO stuff as well . Cant get enough ! ",4
"Bought this for my husband for his birthday and he really enjoyed it . Could n't put it down most nights and zipped through it ! Ca n't wait for the next one ! ",4
"Ca n't say enough for this series.I need to finish reading it before I can give it an adequate rating . I gave it 5 stars because Mr. Martin has been consistent in keeping me enthralled with his writing . ",4
"The previous book while I enjoyed it seemed like it was lacking something that I could n't quite put my finger on . Maybe the lack of main characters that were so crucial to the point and made me kind of Leary of paying so much for the 5th book . But I was my disappointed . All my favorites were back the twists and turns were great and we even have a wonderful set up for all the new characters as well . Ca n't wait for season four and I ca n't wait for book 6 ! ",4
"Author just starts to bring main characters together when the book ends . I wish book 6 was written but planning to reread 5 when 6 comes out . Full of surprises and many unexpected twists . ",4
"If you thought GRRM would redeem himself for the A Feast for Crows snoozefest well you were wrong . Rather than bringing the old GRRM to the game he continued his decline in A Dance with Dragons.Taking the characters that were not in AFfC and a few new ones he puts them to the same wandering that bored you before . Please feel free toa . not buy this book because it contributes almost nothing to the plot orb . feel cheated by another GRRM ripoff.If you are addicted to uncomfortable sex scenes diarrhea andor menus . . . well you wo n't be too disappointed .

"I had read a great deal of reviews on here and as a result was apprehensive in buying the 5th book . After completing book 4 though I was like a rabid dog and needed my fix so decided to bite the bullet and give the 5th book a whirl.You should know that due to the severe negativity of all the reviews I went in with really poor expectations and quite possible could have enhanced my own pleasure of the book . That is I was consistently and pleasantly surprised with the content of the book . I was even trying to figure out exactly why people were being so angry . Storywise the book has a ton of heavy twists and small storyarcs . A lot happens to a lot of characters . Enough so that I was voraciously reading through and finished the book in half the time of the previous books.I think what really made people angry about this one though is that while a lot happens very little comes in the way of moving toward the bigger underlying story arc of the book which is the whole wights and their masters and what role the dragons will play etcI think this is ultimately what people are most annoyed about . The book was just as well written and in many ways better than the previous ones but it lacks any real form of closure . It basically gives the reader the equivalent of literary blue balls.That being said i 'm still lined up to read book 6 and greatly enjoyed the majority of this book and I think most fans of the previous book would to . Just go in knowing that you wo n't see much movement in the greater story arc . ",3
"The best epic phantasy series the original book is far better than the tv series on HBO.I recommend it to everyone.Twin to the 4th book this is the better half.If you read up to the 5th book you will be certainly couting the minutes for the 6th book release . ",4
"It is a good story but the writer drawls . He takes too long in moving the story forward . Life is too short and there is too much to do than spend so much time in a book . ",2
"The companion to book 4 terrible in my opinion . Too much focus on outside characters and lack of knowledge of the main characters . Also huge let down in the end . I honestly do n't think I 'll bother with the rest of the books . ",1
"I absolutely loved this book ! I have to admit that I was a little disappointed about book four . Bringing in so many new characters was a little confusing and not having so many of our favorite characters featured in it was a disappointment to me . That being said book five has more than made up for it and I am eagerly anticipating Book 6 ! Get to work George ! ! ",4
"A Dance with Dragons if the fifth book in The Song of Ice and Fire series after A Game of Thrones A Clash of Kings A Storm of Crows and a Feast for Crows and before The Winds of Winter forthcoming and A Dream of Spring forthcoming.The beginning of this volume is chronologically parallel to A Feast for Crows and focuses on the other half of characters on events in the North of Westeros and beyond the Narrow Sea.Tyrion 's part starts in Pentos where he will be embarked on an unusual adventure to Volantis and Mereen.In the East both Quentyn Martell Victarion Greyjoy are on their way to Mereen to ask Dnerys 's hand in marriage while she tries to conciliate dragons husband lover and peace for her people.At the Wall Jon is trying to cozy up to Stannis and the Red Priestess Melisandre to ensure their help in the defense against the Others.Beyond it Bran is searching the threeeyed crow with Hodor Meera and Jojen Reed and Summer.In the last quarter of the book characters from A Feast for Crows rejoin the cast as timeframes are once again synchronized.It took me over six months to finish this heavy volume ! And even though I 'm very glad to finally be done with it one particular event in the last chapters came as a great shock and now I ca n't wait to read The Winds of Winter whenever it comes out . ",3
"I did not get the part where it becomes boring right after a very interesting start . The characters were kinda lame and very feeble . This is very far from what I expected in his books . ",1
"3 12 stars is what I would give the novel if it was possible . Having said that the series is still in my opinion truly worth the read . The main reason for this rating is the fact that books 4 and 5 should not have been written convoluting the series as a whole . Writing them both to cover the same time period made it confusing and frustrating.Nevertheless I am very anxious for the next novel to be released . ",2
"To make my point I 'll be as concise as possible in this review . 90 % of this and Feast for Crows were not only boring but pointless to plot . The other part of the problem in Feast repeated here is focus on characters that are n't interesting . And most importantly Martin 's insistence on the use of internal narrative over and over again whether it be simple thoughts or dream sequences is completely unnecessary . When it was Catelyn remembering playing with her sister and Littlefinger as kids I could take it because those folks were interesting . But I do n't need 200 pages to realize that Cersei hates everyone and I do n't need 200 pages of Dany contemplating or Tyrion pissing . I do n't need to be reminded anymore that Davos has lost his fingers . If this book was going to be terrible could n't it have been shorter ? ! Maybe in more need of an editor than anything I 've read this side of a Bill Simmons article . ",0
"Each volume of A Song of Fire and Ice has its cliffhangers but this volume binds many threads then leaves them dangling to entice the reader to impatience for the sixth volume . And to end it all winter is here . ",4
"5 years was way too long to wait for A Dance With Dragons . I 'll give GRRM the benefit of the doubt that he knows what he 's doing with the series that started out so promising but only for one more book . If the next is no better than Feast or Dance I 'll not read another . Well at least not in hardcover . Compared to the first three in the series this well sucks . The only reason it 's better than A Feast for Crows is that we do n't have 30 new characters 3500 pages into the story . But one ca n't help but wonder if Martin is as lost as Jordan became ? If so he 's taken what was the best series outside LOTR and turned it to so=so hum drum mismash . What a shame that would be.GRRM if you are reading this please please please get the story moving again . Your fans have suffered through the last two please do n't make them regret their investment in Song . ",1
"keeps the lengthy series moving . does n't drag . when you finish you want the next book.five more words required five ",3
"What can I say about A Dance With Dragons that you could n't figure out for yourself.You already know that none of the threads will be wound up to a happy ending.You already know that several main characters will end up dead.You already know that there will be around one hundred and thirty seven new characters doing new things.You already know that the writing will spread out to fill a prechosen Xhundred blank pages.I found the pacing in this one very slow and by a third of the way in longed for the Eastern continent to suffer the tectonic disaster I was sure was waiting in the wings and swallow all the bloody characters on it so the story could drop a cog and get some traction.Roughly half of it takes place during the action of the previous installment but concerns the events on the Eastern continent then it resynchronizes with real time and the action broadens again moving in part back to Westeros.In the six years between the last novel and this one GRRM discovered the word leal and it gets used everywhere he would have written and indeed did write loyal to the point it starts grating the gears . It would have worked well as a regional thing but that 's not how the writer used it unfortunately . Expect a retroactive editing in the other four books to make them match up properly sometime in the future.I love the series but I 'm getting the distinct feeling that GRRM is now milking it for all its worth especially as it took so long for the kindle edition to become reasonably more than reasonably as it turned out priced and in the interim there have been published some notable stinker side products.I 'm kind of laughing at the situation GRRM 's engineered for himself where the inprint action is so far from finishing that he 'll not be able to deliver the complete saga before the TV series reaches the logical end . ",3
"I 've been reading these for a while like many people on here.I have n't been able to get past the first three episodes of the show yet . I know it 's good but it 's not as appealing as the books for me ! That said the reason for the three stars is my dissatisfaction with the author and his inability to focus on this series or amazing ability to spread himself on many projects at once if you want to go positive with it . ",2
"Does George R.R . Martin get paid by the word ? Book five of the Song of Fire and Ice series titled A Dance with Dragons comes in at over a thousand pages . Considering that this book was meant to extend the stories of half the characters in book four that he left dangling in that large book the volume seems excessive and would benefit from editing . The popularity of the Game of Thrones television adaptation will bring Martin new readers but I expect those who enjoy the visual grandness of this fantasy world will become tired by the prose and the ways in which Martin leaves one storyline and starts up another . Readers with patience and who are tolerant of wordiness will find extravagant and imaginative stories on these pages . Those who find value in more pages per dollar spent will find such value here . Most readers will bore easily and become confused by all the characters and their backstories . Fans will also be bored by the wasted paragraphs retelling the backstories that loyal readers may know as well as the author . All that said this is a genre with little of decent writing to entertain readers and for those who like fantasy tales there 's much to enjoy here very much.Rating Threestar Recommended ",2
"So many characters and so many threads in the story all woven together so well . I 'm looking forward to the next book ",4
"Leaving out half the story lines makes no sense and seems like a bad marketing idea . But nice enough if you want to keep up on half of the main players . ",1
"First off I am not finished reading Dragons yet . I 'm a quarter way through but that does n't mean I ca n't comment on this book because the errors Martin made in Feast for Crows are just as apparent as they are here.From what I 've read so far and this includes Crows this series is out of control . The +200 pages I have read are bursting with clumsy writing people wandering and sailing forever and a constantly expanding universe of new characters new cultures and new plot lines all of which I find displeasing . I 'm already burdened with remembering who the Lannisters Starks Martells Freys Tullys and every one else involved is . Please stop adding new characters.When I read Game of Thrones it was simple . Now it 's agonizingly complicated all because Martin has forgotten where his epic is going.Thanks sir for complicating an already needlessly complicated epic . I will finish Dragons but I do so under protest . ",1
"I waited eleven years for some of these characters between A Storm of Swords and this novel after the horrific mistake of removing half of the character stories from A Feast for Crows . Although I do n't think that Crows was as bad as the average fan says it suffered from pacing issues and having too few characters on which to focus . I would imagine even George recognizes now what an insipid idea it was to change the format of the series mid way through . That is n't done for a reason and we saw why it did n't work and the fans hated it.So fast forward to the long awaited Dance with Dragons . GRRM spent a third of the book trying to rush us up to speed . The book required a brief intro from GRRM attempting to explain the format . Again why was the split ever made ? Dragons was rubbish . I mean garbage . From the overuse of certain words poor editing to the incessant pointlessness of whole story lines again where is the editor ? to the destroying of Tyrion as the series 's most interesting character I did n't think that possible down to the cesspool that is Daenerys ' chapters . Why does she even exist any more ? I 'm also not sure why Sansa Brienne and Samwell were n't in this book and yet Quentyn Martell had endless pages of nothingness devoted to his vapid existence . We follow his painfully dull journey from one continent to the other.. and he dies . And the world is impacted in no way . Again what was the point ? His existence did not move the story forward one bit . And what was with the endless torture of Theon turning him into a disgusting deformed creature that we feel empathy for ? An odd turn I thought . But far less objectionable than much of the rest of the book.I think the first three books in the series were brilliant . The fourth is slower yes but perhaps the best written . The war had ended and many fans were expecting more action but it 's an examination of the hell that wars creates . It 's a thoughtful piece and I 've read it twice enjoying it both times.Dance ? Dance is just horrid . I struggled to finish it and will never go near it again . Eleven years is a long time for any author and GRRM clearly is having difficulty keeping everything together . By his own admission the series was only supposed to be three novels and this world that he created twenty years ago is now far larger and more unwieldy than he ever intended.And it shows . ",0
"This is a book that you just ca n't put down . Of course you need to have read the other books in the series to get the full impact of the story development . All I really want to know is when the next book in the series is coming out . ",4
"What might have been.That seems to be the recurring theme in the 5th volume of A Song of Ice and Fire . Characters are driven not so much by regret as they are by their drive to make amends for their perceived failures . Jon Connington failed to capture Robert Baratheon and thereby keep him from killing Prince Rhaegar at the Battle of the Trident Ser Barristan feels he could have changed the course of history if only he 'd been able to win that allimportant joust Tyrion imagines a life of happiness if only he could have stayed married to the one girl he ever truly loved.While many of our favorite characters for me this includes Tyrion Daenerys Jon and Davos return for A Dance With Dragons Martin continues to spend a great deal of time with new and secondary characters though I personally found the tales much more compelling here than in A Feast For Crows . The various sellsword and mercenary outfits maneuvering around Mereen makes for some fascinating storytelling and in particular the characters of Quentyn Jon Connington and Brown Ben Plumm are welcome additions to Martin 's canon . I also enjoyed Asha 's story and it was nice to see inside the mind of Barristan the Bold.That being said Martin 's storytelling does often have a tendency to drag especially in the early goings as a great deal of travel is required before many of the characters get to anywhere important and during the final act as the story is winding down when the plot seems to lose a bit of speed . Fans are also likely to be upset regarding the halfdozen or so cliffhangers Martin left unresolved and we can only hope that Volume 6 wo n't be another neardecade in the making.All in all however it was a pleasure reconnecting with characters we 've come to know and expect to die almost every time they appear and several of Martin 's plot twists and plot developments were truly remarkable . This is a far cry above A Feast for Crows and we can only hope Martin can keep the momentum from what he achieved here as we roll into the next volume . ",3
"I enjoyed this book much more than the previous . All my favorite characters were back and there was so much going on it made it hard to put the book down . Ca n't wait for book 6 to be available . ",4
"I would like to preface this review but stating that I am a huge GRRM fan . A Song of Ice and Fire is one of my favorite reads . That was until this book . I have just now finished the 959 page torment . I bought this book the day it was released and I have now only just finished reading this 4 months later.I will agree with the other reviewers that this book was way to long and said absolutely nothing . What has George done with my Starks ? I fell in love with this family he made me fall in love with this family and now what ? NOTHING that 's right NOTHING . I loved the whole direwolf connection and I am still waiting for Arya to come home and kick some A $ $ . But no she is still in a temple doing NOTHING . What has happened to the strong women in this story . In this book Dany was weak and whiney and love sick . There were chapters upon chapters of nothingness.I will most likely buy and read the next book when it comes out 5 years from now because I feel like I have invested time from my life I will never get back.Dear GeorgeI need some resolution . I have stuck by you for a very long time now and feel like as with most men you finished the best part way to early . Please do n't write another 959 page book about boats and urinating and what people are wearing and dragons who do n't do anything . I do n't know if I could take that . I will conclude this rant buy saying there are way to many new characters in this story that no one cares about . They do NOTHING but fill paper . Please George get back to the meat of your world . Stop taking us places no one wants to go . You need to reread the first three books again and rekindle your love of these characters that we your readers have come to care about . Also FIRE your editor . ",0
"I have been reading some discussion forums concerning the quality of the higher rating from this book so I 'm going to try and walk the fine line between answering the complaints about the book telling you why I liked it and not giving away every freakin ' detail in the book . Its long ca n't be helped try to keep up.1 . The book it too long and is n't fast enough paced what did you expect ? Its about a major war covering an entire continent . For those who compared it to the length of the Lord of the Rings that story involved like nine people and Tolkien could get pretty wordy . This book involves HUNDREDS of people even when you are n't hearing their voices . And wars take time especially in medieval Europe . Most battles in this type of setting ended one of two ways either you killed the leader in which case everyone gave up hence the importance of banners so people knew when to quit or they were incredibly long sieges which usually only ended once one side or the other had been starved into submission . In which case most of the war was waiting.2 . Are we there yet ? Again what do you expect ? In order to get to point B from point A you have to journey . These journeys often do n't do smoothly and there are often side trips . Like the Tom Bombadil story again for those who like to compare GRRM to Tolkien . These journeys should NOT be skipped however because it is in these moments that characters stop reflect think and GROW . Yes battles are more interesting and energizing but how many deep thoughts can a character have while in battle ? For that matter how many battles can they have before it just gets foolish ? It is this I want it NOW actioncrazed audience that led 7 Samurai from being a fabulous 208 minute movie into The Magnificent 7 which was a tacky western of half the length and then onto a bad TV show that did n't make three seasons . Most people could n't sit through the team actually getting put together and journeying together because they thought it should have been done in a musical montage or something3 . He should havehis editor should haveif he 'd only cut Oh shut up . If you do n't like it because its too long tell us you thought it was too long and do n't read the next one . Even better get out of the backseat yourself and prove you can drive . Go write 5k words and listen to everyone tell YOU that you took too long they did n't like how you took the story and they could have done better.So why DID I like it ? I 'll be honest in places I did n't . Daenerys annoys me . There are too many bleeping characters and I have trouble with names . My geography is too bad to keep track of where everyone is even with the maps . Hence four stars not five . HOWEVER Daenerys annoys me despite the fact that she is supposed to be one we are rooting for . WOW ! A book where I do n't have to like the good guy ! More like Thomas Covenant than the Hobbit ! Reek was horrible butooonow I kinda feel bad for him . Still wish he 'd die but now out of pity . The Dwarf is the BOMB ! He 's witty boinks hot chicks runs circles around his siblings tamed wild men and has great taste in wine . But hey now he 's kinda useless for everything but pig riding . Which bring us to the end point . This is the ONLY series I have ever read where ALL the characters are imperfect three dimensional subject to change and prone to sudden death syndrome . And was n't that what grabbed us in the first book ? Ned 's death ? The sudden DIFFERENCE of it all ? Not every book can have that reach out and grab you by the throat attitude . Like the battles its got ta calm down sometime . In this case the difference and the growth are slower and more subtle . To expect everyone to change overnight in a flash of inspiration is ridiculous.And maybe I 'm wrong . Maybe he is a paid by the word guy . Maybe he 's just lost it . Who knows . The answer is I DO N'T . If you do n't like the book fine . I do . But do n't act like you have a clue where the series is going or what the author is thinking because you do n't . And neither do I so I 'm gon na keep reading.For those who want to judge the quality of my review have at . I am NOT a writer and do n't pretend to know how to write prose . If I did I 'd be too busy spending the next five years trying to come up with a story to top my LAST book all the while knowing that if I have a slow spot in the tale I 'm gon na be crucified . Why is it taking so long for GRRM to write these books ? Probably because the stress to stay perfect is giving him writer 's block ! ",3
"The book was ok . However I wish that more ground could have been covered . On the plus side though it appears that Mr. Martin 's next Song of Ice & Fire entry is set to begin with a bang . So many cliffhangers to be resolved ! ",2
"A wonder full story ripe with personalities and deftly written . As Monty Python use to exclaim that no one expects the spanish Inquisition and no one expects the plot twists that come one 's ways . And within this framework MR Martin provide us characters who think what they want say but say what is most prudent.A plot give away The moral in the story do not have the luxury to win out and are placed in positions where may or may win not . The palace intrigues are deftly executed or botched depending on the capabilities of the character undertaking the task . One meets folks who really understand the game thrones and the those who are real pretenders.And if this were not enough commentary on regions philosophy individual greed family and the need for love if not the central to the story pops up regularly and just makes the book that much more special ",3
"The primary purpose of this review is to voice my deep disappointment to add another 1star review to the list . I only wish that I could vote negative stars.Most of the plot or action involves new characters or at least characters who first appeared in novel 3 or later whom I only vaguely remember and could n't care less about . Sure old favorites Daenerys Tyrion Arya Jon Snow and Bran Stark make welcome even if brief appearances but usually muddying the plot line if there is a plot line rather than advancing it in any foreseeable direction . Everything of interest at least to me which happens in volumes 3 to 5 could be well and completely related in 100 pages . Something like 5000 pages into this epic there is still no closure to any of the substoriesnor at this point is there even hope that there ever will be closure in subsequent volumes . For example there are no Lanisters left to get even with . Every time a little momentum gets going the protagonist invariably one of the few interesting characters is killed and the viewpoint shifts to a different character POV in a different story line . It 's even worse when murdered characters come back to life a thousand pages later after having been burned to a crisp or beheaded etc . because they were n't really dead . Is Ned Stark going to be resurrected in volume 6 ? The theme of impersonators for Arya Sansa Theon etc . is way past moldy . Sure some bad guys are killed or humiliatedbut there is no feeling of justice having been served . They get theirs not for the evil they 've done but rather for pointless political reasons . Even when Tyrion kills his father a sick old man sitting on the toilet it 's just pathetic not triumphant not even satisfying . I 'm tired of my interest being piqued by interesting new themes or sidestories which are abandoned and never developed . I 'm exhausted by the cancerous convolutions and the lack of continuity . I 'm particularly annoyed by the frequent feeling that I must have accidentally skipped several chapterscaused by abrupt jumps leaving gaps in the main storylines which are never filledin.As far as all that praise for the reality of the story . Yeh the series is more like real life than is traditional fantasy literature . I happen to be a published historian . I research and write real life stories history . Despite those usually horrible highschool and college courses we all suffered through wellwritten history is fascinating because the stories are real . An appreciation of real history actually has value in living our lives . I read literature particularly fantasies as a vacation from realityto enjoy a simpler imaginary world in which things are simple problems are resolved and justice prevails . It may not be reality but it is a form of hope . Realityyes read history . Fantasyyes read Tolkien and Rawlings.Many reviews extol the lack of magic and fantasy another way of praising the reality . One woman approvingly wrote When a character is killed he stays dead . What novel was she reading ? Although I love Rawlings Tolkien etc . the fact is the relatively little magic in The Song of Ice and Fire is a distraction . Besides most of the magic in TSOI & F is scary old icky magic zombies possession reanimation of corpses etc . not the appealing imaginative magic of Rawlings Tolkien etc . Giants and dragons undoubtedly hook many prospective readers but so far GRR Martin has little more than mentioned them in passing . TSOI & F might indeed be better without the little magic that it contains.Yeh I know there are already a thousand 1star reviews and nobody will read this one nor yours but that 's no reason not to vote . Write your own 1star review in order to record your own vote . ",0
"The book was a bit too long . Suggest it could have been broken into two books . A reader could be lost or forget what happened in the story line of character from the beginning to the end by the time you reach 34 's of the way through . Ending of this Dragons was unexpected . ",4
"I really liked it I do think this should have been book Four part B instead of Five and I understand why some were not as happy with this book however it was a great story one that must be told to prepare us for the next . It was to much to put into one book so here was four and five . Great tales betrayals and twists . Had me on my toes . As an avid reader this was great ! Things are happening ! There are many stories in this series . All of them are intense . Great read . ",4
"This was the 5th book in a series I could not put down . Writing these books seems to have become this author 's career and reading them has become mine . ",3
"I read the rest of the series in paperback then I got my Kindle loved reading it on my Kindle as the book gives the wrist too much of a work out . I love this series and am looking forward to where it goes next . The Kindle just made the experience even more enjoyable . ",4
"I have watched all of The Game of Thrones and really loved reading about what will be happening in Season 3 and beyond ! If you like fantasy this is a great read . ",4
"Would 've been an appropriate title.I am so disgusted with myself for the amount of time I wasted reading this book . I ca n't even imagine how disgusted George Martin must be with himself for the amount of time he wasted writing it.Jon Snow dead ? Who knows who cares any more . I 'm finished with this series . Mr. Martin do us a favor and stop writing it 's unbearable . ",0
"This kind of dragged in places did n't stop me reading the book though . Wish it had ended with more information of what happened to all the characters . Especially Tyrion.he is my favourite . ",4
"So disappointed . As what most readers will say the first three books were phenomenal . I could not put the books down . Now though with the last 2 and especially this one I forced myself to finish . It really feels like GRRM has lost interest in this series and that he is only writing now for a paycheck . This book was mostly filler just like the previous one . GRRM would spend pages on how someone felt look or just the scenery . I am also getting a sense that he has no idea what to do with his characters anymore . They just keep dieing.When the next nook comes out whenever that may be I will definitely wait to see what the reviews are prior to spending the money to buy it . The series is so not worth the money as it currently stands . ",1
"I love the HBO series Game of Thrones . I was so glad to find out it was based on a series of books ! ",4
"I took away one star only because so many characters kept popping up and I had difficulty figuring out who they were and where they came from I used the maps and the character glossary 10 times more than with the other books.That being said I loved every page of the book . My only regret is that we might have to wait another five years for the sequel . My favorite characters are Tyrion and Jon Snow but I was aghast and left hanging about their futures.Terrific time spent reading this book . ",3
"great condition and I am looking forward to reading it once I get through the first 4 books ! Would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a great read . ",4
"Thoroughly enjoyable read . Intrigue betrayal and plot twists that catch you completely by surprise . Ca n't wait for the next one . ",4
"I read the series over the past winter & ca n't wait for book 6 to be released . Loved this series . ",3
"The series Game of Thrones has become one of my favorite series of books . When I picked up this book I was immediately transported into this imaginary time and place . Each book in the series contains it 's own flavor while continuing the saga . Love each and every book eagerly awaiting books six and seven . ",4
"Riveting read ! So descriptive ! You can smell the smells ! Feel the characters . Drawn into them and wish there are more hours in the day to read it ",4
"I read the first 4 books and devoured the first three but began to get confused on the 4th book because about a hundred pages in characters started to just disappear and it focused heavily on just a few strangely they were not all the prime characters either . It was not until I got to the end that I read that it began as a 'normal ' book but when it got way too long he decided to split it . but get this he did not split it chronologically and take everyone to a certain point before cutting off . Instead he split the book laterally and took half the characters on and left half behind unmentioned . Now if this sounds confusing you got it right it was . So I bought Dance with Dragons and felt totally confused as events that I had read about like the death of a major character were in the future . so you are reading about them as though they were alive knowing they had already died . It 'did my head in ' ! He introduces a number of significant new characters and I could not work out who they were or where they came from . Events happen with no explanation . People appear to have died only to pop up 500 pages later . Honestly it was a mess . I desperately wanted to finish this book and may eventually go back to it because apparently towards the end of the book it all comes back together . The trouble is this is over 1000 pages and tbh I dont know if I have the stamina to plough all the way to the end . He is such an amazing storyteller I get absolutely no pleasure in trashing him but in this case he got it radically wrong . ",2
"My son liked the books and read them all and enjoyed them but I could n't finish the first book of the series even though I am an avid reader . I am going to go back and try again because I have a hard time with something that defeats me like a silly book ! I gave it a 3 star because he liked it and I should have liked it so it averaged out . ",2
"I agree with almost all of the reviews . I 'm just so disappointed that the main characters from books 13 have been given such short shrift . I mean come on already at least tie up a few plot lines before inundating readers with new characters that come and go randomly through the last two books . I found myself going back and forth trying to figure out who the heck these people were when they popped up hundreds of pages later and no sooner do you figure it out than they disappear again completely . I get it he 's going to milk this since the series came out but PLEASE resolve at least a few of the subplots about the random characters and get back to the meat of the first three books . I 'm not opposed to continuing the story by any means but it drove me nuts reading books four and five with basically NO resolution whatsoever . After reading all five books I just ca n't help thinking that the only things I know for sure is that Ned 's dead Jaime lost a hand and half a hundred is one of GRRM 's favorite phrases among others that we can all repeat by roteall together now about as useful as nipples on a breastplate which has just occurred to me could pretty much describe the screwy timelines and general frustration in reading these last two books . I could go on but I 'll let George do that if he ever gets around to it . ",1
"This book happens about the same time period as Feast of Crows only it has all the characters missed in feast . There is a lot of travel and more worldbuilding describing the Free Cities and the Rhoyne . Some of the characters make some pretty stupid mistakes and suffer for it . Some of the chapters annoyed me and I wanted to smack some sense into the characters but I 'm sure martin will do that in Winds of Winter when the perverbial $ & ! # will hit the fan.Some new characters emerged and at first I wondered why but I enjoyed the hell out of this book as I 'm addicted to Westeros . I 'm listening to the chapters on audiobook every day and it seems I learn more and more with each day I listen . I love this world . Keep it coming George ! ",3
"Short and sweet still love the series but it seems like lots of pages that do n't move the plot forward . It is starting to feel more and more like the Wheel of Time series which we all know ground to a halt . Hopefully Mr. Martin will not die before he completes the series.I first gave this a 3 for its OK but downgraded to a 2 as I realized I did n't like it . ",1
"STOP ! Do not waste your time . There are so many threads left unanswered it defies belief . He has fallen into the eternal series trap . ",0
"Dazed uncertain SER GEORGE stumbled through the wilderness.His plans were as ruined as LORD TYWIN 'S groin . All the sellswords he 'd hired had capriciously abandoned him to pursue their own deviant agendas.THE OTHERS for instance were supposed to be the Primary Villains of the series . Unfortunately they were n't very villainous instead they proved to be borderline retarded . In eight thousand years not one of them had realized they could build boats sail around the Wall and thus transform it into a Westerosian Maginot Line . Instead they hung out in the Haunted Forest and said Boo every so often.JON SNOW could no longer remember why he was in the book or what he was supposed to do . Each time a decision was required of him as Lord Commander of the Watch he did the least responsible most goofy thing he or anyone could imagine . Somebody was apparently sneaking funky stuff into JON 's ranger brownies.DANY TARGARYEN was even more forgetful . She could not remember where Westeros was or what she had ever wanted to do with it . Instead she became a slutty bureaucrat possibly because that 's the kind of character fantasy readers invariably love the most . SER GEORGE was very annoyed with DANY and totally wanted his money back.TYRION LANNISTER was still funny but showing signs of Otherlike retardation . Someone had told him You should hide in a wine keg and be transported to the Free Cities but you do n't need to know which one nor do you need to have any money or friends when you get there . And TYRION quite unlike himself had said Brilliant ! This is the best possible plan ! Sign me up.BRAN STARK had the only subplot in which Things Were Happening ! Therefore SER GEORGE who had no idea what to do with interesting subplots abandoned it halfway through the book.THE OTHER STARK KIDS including JON SNOW were all of a sudden transformed into skinchangers who could not only link mentally with their own direwolves in dreams but also other animals including presumably human beings . They had just never noticed that or gotten around to it before somehow.CERSEI LANNISTER was bald . This might have been interesting but DANY had beaten her to the punch and gotten bald first . At one point SER GEORGE considered naming the book A BALDNESS OF QUEENS . DANY going bald also meant that she could n't tug on her braid.QUAITHE flatout sucked . Given twenty seconds to answer questions she did n't even try to warn DANY of the most daunting threat imaginable that readers were getting bored.EVERYONE INVOLVED WITH WINTERFELL was grumpy . Snow fell they were cold and hungry . Whatever.THE DRAGONS were getting big and fat and dragony but despite the book title nobody was doing anything with them so there really was n't much point in their being in the story . This upset their tummies.Even THE PLOT once Ser George 's most trusted comrade had vanished into the fog seemingly never to return.What was SER GEORGE to do ? ",1
"Not as great as the first 2 or 3 by Martin but a great book in a great series of books . Martin lives up to his reputation of always keeping you guessing by putting his character through situations that change their lives . ",4
"wow had to skip entire chapters and nothing much happened in the book other than dragons growing larger . If GRRM is not careful the Dragons might die of old age and then he will have an other Kong to deal with.S ",2
"As others have already exhaustively deatailed comparatively it 's a great book . For GRMM it 's subpar . I 'm tired of the cliffhangers and the teasers . Give me a story with some meat in it and for the love of anything sacred stop with the reality showlike teasers.When I began reading the series I thought it was plodding until I concluded that GRRM likes to carefully set up the chess pieces and then give you a great climax . Not so in the last two books.GRRM is still doing some great things and it 's still a good read by any measure but the nonresolution of so many strands is starting to grate . The exposition in book 5 is unneeded . If you 're beginning the series at book five you deserve to be confused.I guess I 'm one of the few that enjoyed AFFC and I enjoyed this novel too . It 's just that he spends so much time on wasted events . Hell half the events that do occur give you no emotional payoff . It 's like paying to be tortured.I 'm starting to dread that much like The Wheel of Time series which gave me weeks of enjoyable reading when I began it in high school he 's just writing and writing and does n't really know where to go with things.I do n't mean this as a personal attack on the author not by a long shot . I love the series . I love the ideas and the injection of serious adult memes . It just reads like he 's losing his way . ",2
"This is an excellent book . The complaint that nothing happens ignores significant developments and tremendous character maturation here . The writing is good . The sometimes irritating tics such as much and more are there to provide atmosphere and they do it . If you like this series you 'll like this book . ",3
"A long wait and so disappointing . The book was wordy and overly descriptive . How much detail do we really need when a person is eating I do n't really care about what the people are eating I want a progressive plot . Unless the food is somehow moving the plot along I just do n't care . This goes as well for the lengthy deep thinking done by many of the characters which actually come out as a lot of woe is me . The book could have been cut by 400 words . I found myself drifting off a lot or skimming quickly through pages to get back to the plot . Some of the characters such as Davos were so boring that I almost skipped their chapters . The past books have been so good this left me numb . ",1
"I got started late on this series so I was able to go from one book to the next without waiting until this point . Ack ! I 'm still amazed at how fairly central characters are killed off but it does as some reviewers have written give the sense that anything can happen and increases uncertainty and excitement and perhaps a bit more realistic or as realistic as a fictionalhistoricalfantasy series can be . ",4
"I realize that these books are supposed to be about the land versus individual characters . But come on . Stop killing people for the sake of killing people . If I had n't committed so much time the books already then I would n't bother with the next one.Shock value for shock value is really absurd.Plus have a little more closure in between books . ",1
"' A Dance With Dragons ' drags along at a snail 's pace leaving you literally begging Martin for something interesting to happen.When the few interesting parts do finally occur you are already too beaten down by overly descriptive minutia to feel that the book has vindicated your hard earned reading time.And seriously wtf is up with all the food and wine references ? I 've had my fill of Dornish wine . More substance please ! I fear that the glory days of the ' A Song Of Ice And Fire ' series and those wonderful first three books are long gone . It eerily reminds me of how the 'Star Wars ' movies progressed From entertaining and thrilling stories with characters you actually care about to painfully tedious boredom.Fool me once AFFC shame on you . Fool me twice ADWD shame on me.I wo n't be pulled into buying another installment without being patient and reading the reviews first . Martin may not care about my time and what I feel is enjoyable but I do . ",0
"I am so addicted ! I can not wait for season 4 to start and for book 6 to be released . And I need this to be the end ! I have already read 5000+ pages ! ",4
"Contrary to many I am overall pretty satisfied with George RR Martin 's A Dance With Dragons . Does it have problems ? Well yeah and some of those are huge . But is it the worst book of the series deserving of the derision and vitriol that 's been heaped upon it by lots of reviewers ? Certainly not . Allow me to elaborate.I wo n't recount the plot here if plot is even the right wordmeandering at times achingly slow and then devastatingly wicked at others there 's entirely too much going on . Most of the chapters are Tyrion 's Jon 's and Dany 's points of view but others surface as well including Theon Davos Jaime Cersei and Arya . There were a couple of POVs I must admit to being puzzled by but I have to hope that ultimately Martin will bring them to a satisfying intricacy with the main characters . Would I have loved to know what Brienne and Sansa were up to ? Sure but it 's all right . We 're moving along however slowly and lots of Tyrion is always worth it.Biggest complaints ? Well the pacing is off in the first two hundred pages or so with way too much detail given to traveling woes and feasting items . In any other series these would be deal breakers . Do I think Martin 's editor was snoozing ? Probably . Just because you are uber successful does n't mean you should be allowed to enumerate every food on a table . My other big huge complaint is that it had been so long since I 'd read A Feast For Crows I was LOST for a hundred pages . That 's my own fault for not rereading but I also lay some blame on Martin since five years between books is inexcusable.What I liked ? Lots of things.The dialogue is perfect and the intrigue is thick . We got vintage Martin with double crosses lots of gore and set ups galore . Loved loved loved Theon 's comeuppance and what he does later in the novel loved Barristan Selmy 's honor loved the twist with Rhaegar 's son . I found what happened with Dany and her dragons distasteful yet entirely plausible I know that the bloodletting has only barely begun after Cersei 's humiliation . And poor Jon Snowalways trying to do the right thing but it 's usually at the wrong time and with the wrong people.Martin 's world is convoluted overblown and nasty much like the world we live in today . His writing however while needing editing still draws one in and builds suspense causing me to continue turning pages and luxuriating within the boundaries of the Seven Kingdoms and Beyond . Personally I 'm invested for the long haul even if A Dance With Dragons pales when compared to A Storm of Swords . It 's not the comparison I try to keep in mind it 's the journey . ",3
"Like the rest of the series a good story but I wish there was an easy way to keep everything straight . By the time the next book comes out I 'm going to have to reread the previous books . ",2
"This book is like the NFL star running back that finally gets his big payday . Then does n't need to produce anymore and has the worst season he has ever had . It just seems that George R.R . Martin has gotten his big payday and is n't hungry anymore . I sure hope he has room for dessert . Because I really loved this story ! Keeping my fingers crossed for book # 6 ! ",2
"I love the entire series . I am looking forward to the final installment . I cant wait to see how this series will end ",4
"The story keeps unfolding and more and more twists and turns ca n't wait for the next book . I am very invested to this series of books . ",4
"There was a huge gap between book 4 and book 5 so this was something I was really looking forward to . Book 4 and book 5 take place during the same time period but one has half the characters and the other has the other half of the characters . I have to say it is getting a bit boring and starting to feel a bit dragged out . Yes there were exciting cliff hangers but I want things to move faster ! ",3
"A fantastic read . Better than the TV show by a mile I read this before watching and still do live the TV show . Full of twists and turns that keep you excited to see what will happen next . Do n't get too attached to some of the characters or you may regret it . Buy this now . ",4
"Since I hated book 4 5 was much better and explained more from book 3 13 are great . 4 blah but you have to read it . shame that you have to wait until 2014 for the 6th book there are to be 7 in series . ",4
"I love the series especially the first 3 books but this one was drawn out . It 's a great book tho it really gets better closer to the end n the last chapter is SWEET ",3
"Just once I would like this author to finish writing a book . This story just keeps getting longer and longer . Do n't get me wrong I like serial books . I enjoy catching up with my favorite characters in new and exciting novels . What I do n't appreciate is the neverending cliffhanger endings in these books . It would n't be so bad if the next novel was available within a reasonable amount of time but to wait 25 YEARS for a followup book after leaving so many dangling storylines is a bit much to ask . George this may well be the last of your books that I read . ",2
"I love the series of books and can not wait to see the TV series adapt this in the TV show . It is a very captivating read . ",4
"This is the next in the series and it does n't disappoint . No spoiler here but the ending is somewhat unexpected and harsh . Not sure where GRR 's gon na go with it next . ",4
"So I was most annoyed about Martin 's decision to divide his characters between two books separated as they were by geographic distance.In part my annoyance may have been due to not really liking the southern characters and at the time I did not realise there would be a payoff the next book Dance with Dragons would be ALL about the characters I did like ! Well for the most part Martin still manages to meander around with characters I barely heard of letalone care about and for some the plot will still appear to be moving at snails pace.Still D w Ds rules . Martin 's writing is crisp and powerful seeming to have evolved over the sixish years he took to write this book . Obviously if you 've read up to this one in the series you 're probably going to read this anyway I 'm just providing a heads up this is a goodun ",4
"I 've been waiting for this book to arrive and started reading it immediately . So absorbed in this series ! ! Absolutely love it..ca n't wait for the next one ! ! ",4
"This illegal price fixing which has been forced down our throat is sickening.The actual book is almost as bad . The first 4 were pretty good but few folks will even be able to get through this garbage.I hope the Government fines the publishers and puts a few in prison now that would be a very happy ending ! ",0
"lots of characters left hanging without any resolution..just a lot of fighting without any sense.guess it 's like today . read it to see what happens to all the characters G. Martin has introduced ",2
"Excellent book . I could not put it down . I am waiting with anticipation for book # 6 . I ca n't wait see how everything comes together . LOVE IT ! ",4
"Does n't disappoint as usual . I hate how he kills people off so easily though . Ca n't wait for the next one ! ",4
"I 'm very please with my purchase . It 's exactly as described will buy from u again . Adding it to my collection is a pleasure it 's perfect to display . Thank u ! ! ! ",4
"I ca n't wait for the next one . This book had many characters return that were previously thought to have been disposed of . Once you think you know what 's coming up a new twist a different direction . ",4
"It seems the author grew tired of witty engaging stories for his characters because unlike the last four books this one was as useless as nipples on a breast plate ",1
"I waited a long time for this book but it 's the biggest disappointment I 've had since the last installment of this aimless plodding series . From the opening pages spent in the POV of a character we 've never seen before and do n't see again through long dull chapter after chapter of only the briefest vignettes that do nothing to advance the story to the bitter flat ending I simply could not believe that it could possibly be this bad . I kept waiting for the old George R R Martin to rear his head and tell an actual story . But no . Apparently the old Goerge R R Martin is no more.I 'll bet the only people more upset than the readers who 've invested in this monumental waste are the execs at HBO who 've agreed to another season of the show only to discover that Martin has failed to deliver anything that would sustain the project.Hopefully the people at Random House have Brandon Sanderson waiting in the wings and will bring him in to rescue this mess without George having to die for the honor . ",0
"So much corruption so much deceitjuicy ! I ca n't wait to see what 's nextI ca n't wait to see the show ",4
"I enjoyed the book immensely and am looking forward to the next installment . a must read for those who have read the ones before ",4
"This the 5th book I have read and not finished it yet but it great.Do n't let the number of pages put off like the other 3 in this series I am really enjoying it . ",4
"Ok so I have now read all five of the Ice and Fire series and can say that I will not be picking up the sixth whenif it ever comes out . The first three books are some of my favorite titles of all time . A Clash of Kings is just all around a great story with great character . And the next was good but you could tell it was beginning to fall off . And then you get to A Feast for Crows where the whole series falls apart . You read about a bunch of character you do n't care about and wonder Where the hell is Jon and Tyrion ! Well you finally get them back in this book but you will be very disappointed with these characters . The book in whole just never catches steam . You read about people walking and thinking about doing something and sitting in rooms with each other talking about doing something and then by the end none of it happens.I know no review will make someone who has read all the books stop them from reading this one I read a ton saying do not read this and look at me but i figured I 'd spare you the 15 bucks and tell you you are not missing anything . ",1
"It feels like it 's time to be done . This book is the book in the series that has the story lines that go nowhere . A new idea is introduced followed and GRRM finds it 's not going to pan out so he ends it . Danearys is getting really boring . What is she going to do ? Is she going to stay in Mereen forever or go to Westeros ? What 's Tyrion to do ? He 's here there and everywhere and manages to stay alive even though he 's got a sharp tongue and a price on his head . Jaime is introduced FOR ONE CHAPTER ! ! ! What the hell was that all about ? The wall is a mess and falling apart . Stannis ' story line just stops . It 's pretty heavy following him for awhile and then it 's just done . The one line that I really liked was Theon but again BIG event and then it just falls off . Dorne is useless here . We find that they try to join in on things but alas they are just not too popular strong fun who knows what but GRRM stops the story line there.I 'm hoping that the next installment is A almost done and B better than this offering . We 'll see . ",2
"I 'm seeing a lot of downbeat reviews & that 's fine everyone has hisher own opinion . My own feeling is that this was the best book of the series yet big bold ugly with plenty of potentially bloody cliffhangers to end it all.Beyond that I have to respect the way Martin made me feel sorry for Reek & almost had me feeling sorry for Cersei . Almost . There 's no way I could ever actually sympathize with that slimey wretched loathesome woman but Martin almost pulled it off until I reminded myself just who & what that despicable creature is & smiled at the image conveyed.I loved the story . I ca n't wait for the next one . ",4
"None of the things you want to read about are in this book.There will be travel food description senseless backstory and endless lineage details for characters you care nothing about and have no real narrative relevance . This book is stalling . A huge huge collection of words all used for stalling . ",1
"Finally finished reading A Dance with Dragons by George R.R . Martin . 1016 pages took me 6 weeks to complete . It was good but after a 6year gap since A Feast for Crows and an 11year gap since A Storm of Swords it is hard to say it was totally worth the wait . At least I can look forward to a more timely HBO production schedule ! ",2
"Many folks seem to be complaining how this book set the stage for many an event so to speak but did n't actually deliver this is only halftrue . The reason for this is that many people have a predetermined idea of where the story 'should ' be going based on what they 've seen thus far in the book but George has shown time and time again that just as you should n't get too attached to any one character you should n't get too attached to any one plot line . If everything played out exactly as you thought it would what would be the point in reading the book ? There are many twists and turns on our way to our final destination and in fact it 's those twists and turns that keep us coming back for more . Yes certain storylines did n't get resolved . Maybe they NEVER will but why they wo n't is interesting if it 's told in a compelling and organic way to the story which I think in nearly every instance it was in this book.To sum up this book was very interesting and entertaining to read certainly worth your time and money . Do n't put a lot of stock in the naysayers the majority of them are just upset because they 've been waiting so long for what they think is little resolution and as I said before it 's because they already had it in their minds that these things NEEDED to be resolved instead of letting the author take us down the path while we enjoy the ride . ",3
"I hate so say it but I 'm done with this series . George has killed off most of the good characters and I really do n't feel like getting invested in another character that may have been mentioned three books ago that I have no recollection of . The only interesting one left is Aria and you could write one good book about her alone . I do not care to wait eight or so years for the next book . ",1
"Martin admits in the acknowledgments that this book was three bitches and a bastard to write . If you can withstand boredom on an epic scale you can see why . Too many characters too little action and far far too much musing about the past or what may or may not happen in the future . Very little of any consequence happens in over 900 pages . I had hoped that after the Crows fiasco the author would get back on track . Unfortunately GRRM went even further off the rails . ",0
"It arrived in excellent condition.I give it a 5 because it looks durable and arrived in such a mint condiiton.i am very pleased with the product and would recommend others to buy it . ",4
"Amazing as usual . It tied things up nicely and left just a few fun questions for dare I hope the next installment ",4
"So i watched the HBO series before I read the books . Love both but the books as always rival the series which did n't entirely stay true to the books ' storyline . Highly anticipating the release of the final books ! ! ",4
"The A Song of Ice and Fire series is one of my most favorite reads . This entry is the most recent release and one of the most fantastic . If you love the show you should read the series and multiple times . It 's a realistic fantasy tale that takes you deeper into its world than any other series has ever dared . It 's an amazing work but GRR will break your heart while he keeps you turning the pages . ",4
"DamnNot the ending I was expecting . Now I am disappointed that I have to wait for the next book . Again George R.R . Martin has crafted a story that makes you want to hold on for dear life as the heads roll and we race from one vignette to another . The dwarf has more lives than a cat and Snow is coming into his own . ",4
"Not quite as good as the others but still a good read . At times it seems like he is stretching the story out a lot further than it has to be . I found myself thinking enough with the side tracks already Get himher to where heshe is going But it does move the story along and there some significant events . ",3
"At the end of A Feast for Crows AFFC we could read Tyrion Jon Danny .. will be along next year I devoutly hope in A Dance with Dragons ADWD which will focus on the events along the Wall and across the sea just as the present book focused on King 's Landing.G.Martin June 2005Further to justify that just 680 pages of AFFC took 5 years to be written G.Martin tells us that ADWD was ALREADY finished . He merely had to publish the available material in two books instead of one.Well as we all know ADWD did n't come the next year nor the year after . The book already written in 2005 took full 6 years to be published . It was necessary to remind these facts because obviously this incredibly long time span raised significantly our expectations.If we had already to wait so long it better be a masterpiece of A Storm of Swords caliber.Let us be honest ADWD is to the Song of Ice and Fire what the Crossroads of Twilight were to the Wheel of Time . In other words a subpar lazy piece of writing which deserves 1 star because it is not possible to give less.As an aggravating circumstance comes that this piece of . work was laboriously extruded during a full decade AFFC+ADWD = 11 years.The Crossroads of Twilight has been very weak but at least R.Jordan did n't need 11 years to throw it at us.Readers and the series fans have speculated that George Martin has lost inspiration or interest.I submit that he lost both.First he obviously lost interest.ADWD has 959 pages prologue and epilogue included and contains 73 chapters.Let us be generous and consider that Martin mislead us and that actually only the half of this has been written in june 2005 so 480 pages and 37 chapters.That leaves us with 36 chapters and 480 pages to write.Obviously a writer committed to his work and as devoted as G.Martin says he is will put some hard work in the writing.Nobody expects 8 hours a day but what do you think about his interest when the result is 480 pages in 6 years 312 weeks ? If one considers that Martin wrote more than 1 chapter a week for the first 3 volumes and how GOOD those volumes were ! he 'd have indeed needed about 1 year to finish ADWD as he said.The unavoidable conclusion by comparing the 37 weeks of work with the 312 weeks delay is that Martin spent about 10 % of his available productive time on writing ADWD.Those glaring disparities tell a clear story while Martin had been both inspired and interested during the first 3 volumes he bungled AFFC and completely lost interest in ADWD.As this would be irrelevant we 'll not speculate about the reasons but everybody who occasionaly read Martin 's blog knows why he lost interest.A severe case of hypercephalitis new Tolkien indeed ! has certainly played a role .Second he lost inspiration.Here we will go in some length and spoilers are unavoidable . Actually there is nothing surprising or unexpected that happens in ADWD to warrant a spoiler alert but it is a tradition that I respect.As I said ADWD is composed of 73 chapters . They are structured as folllowsThe Wall+ Stannis 22 chapters and 30 % of ADWD===============================================Jon 14Davos 4Asha 3Melissandre 1As you see this part which makes a whopping third of ADWD is all about Jon . What is so thrilling about him that Martin needs 14 chapters ? Well Jon counts sausages . Cheese too . When he does n't count sausages he receives wildlings south of the Wall . As they are many and more mostly weak wounded crippled and otherwise impaired he wonders what they will eat . And goes to count sausages . All this interspersed withYou know nothing Corncorncornand The night is dark and full of terror . It finishes with a REALLY ridiculous wannabe cliffhanger which will make you burst out laughing.The 4 Davos chapters are among the best and especially Lord Wyman Manderly one of the few survivors of the excellent beginnings is truly a character that still has 3 dimensions.Asha is useless drivel and Melissandre without interest.For those interested about Stannis like I am his arc does n't advance a single inch but you will be fed another ridiculous cliffhanger so that you may wait the next 5 or 10 years.Meeren + Daenerys 33 chapters and 45 % of ADWD===============================================Tyrion 13Daenerys 10Barristan 4Quentyn 4Victarion 2I admit that I waited for this part with much interest . Most of us remember Martin 's whining how he was struggling year after year with the Meerenese knot . For the struggling part as I showed above he did n't struggle much . So what about the knot part ? Tyrion Wherever whores go Lannister is actually on travels . You may leave him a message he will call back in 5 years . Or 10 . Is that all ? Yes it is . Nothing knotted there.Daenerys transformed in a whining sex obsessed teenager with about as much intelligence as an oyster . We all know that her only purpose in the book is to tame her dragons get to Westeros and kick Lanisters ' as . Not that there are many Lannisters left because Martin has already exterminated everything that counted in the family anyway.Well in those 10 chapters Daenerys did n't make any progress towards this goal.She 's stranded in Meeren surrounded by all kinds of Ahrrakz pffz Zgriks who do not like her and want the fighter pits opened . She does n't . Then she opens them anyway . Everything is linear boring and predictable . The slave and slavers can exterminate each other for all we care but they do n't even do that . Not a trace of a knot here either.As Daenerys is temporarily absent to get our dose of Ahrrakz pffz Zgriks we need Ser Barristan to give it . He kills some guy in a definitely non knotted way.Quentyn . This is a disaster waiting to happen . Nobody remembers this guy and nobody cares . But that 's all right because Martin kills him after the 4 chapters anyway . Pure waste of time and space . Useless to add that there is no knot even with the wildest imagination.Victarion is a real badass one of the few that are left . I admit that I enjoyed his 2 chapters even if Martin succeeded in the very hard task consisting in avoiding any action or character development at any price . In any case Victarion is a very straightforward guy with nothing knotted about him.So definitely this part which makes about half of the book is happening in places we do n't care about indulges in endless travelling Tyrion and descriptions contains no plot at all and is generally irrelevant to anything that was important for the series . It is especially this part which demonstrates how uninspired and boring Martin became the Quentyn chapters are an embarrassment and an insult to the intelligence of all readers.If there was any knot than it was only in Martin 's imagination because with the best will you wo n't find anything that would be more complex or more knotted than a highway through Nevada .Westeros 10 Chapters and 15 % of ADWD========================================Theon 7Cersei 2Jaime 1Theon belongs with Davos to the best . We are in the thick of the contest for the North . The Boltons and the Freys are still their old selfs . We get a glimpse on what 's seething in this cauldron and there are even moments which show that Westeros could still be interesting if Martin was not lazy and uncaring.Cersei was downgraded from a strong beautiful and vicious woman in Storm to a wilful totally paranoid bundle of nerves in AFFC . Martin finishes her off in ADWD . She is broken and exits the scene . Oh I almost forgot the last Lannister who still had some strength and personality gets killed too.Jaime 's chapter is just a manner of Martin to taunt us I served you a cliffhanger in AFFC and you thought to get the result in ADWD ? Well I wo n't give it just to show you how little I care . Perhaps in 6 years . RAFO ! Hehehe ! Trash for lack of better word 8 chapters and 10 % of ADWD=============================================================Bran 3Arya 2Griff 2Areo 1Bran 's chapters consist of Bran watching roots grow . Literally . Unfortunately he 's necessary to the plot because he will deal with The Others when the time comes . Probably in many and more years if Martin and we live so long . So we had to suffer through those bleak chapters just to avoid forgetting who he was.I can understand that some readers were so desperate that even watching roots grow was an improvement to many other chapters so that they semiliked the Bran 's part.Arya 's chapters are totally and utterly irrelevant to everything and anything . She has been training for assassin for the last 11 years and still does so.Griff introduces us to another resurrection . Not that we did n't expect this one.Areo . Who ? So what can be salvaged from this literary train wreck called ADWD preceded by another train wreck in the making AFFC ? Theon 7 chapters Davos 4 chapters Victarion 2 chapters Griff 1 chapter Daenerys 1 or 2 chapters and Jon 1 or 2 chapters . Maximum 17 chapters out of 73.1 star .I am very pessimistic for the continuation . Martin has clearly lost it and the story will now just follow the gravity forces with much and more copy and paste . The strong and powerful characters we cared for are dead and those who stay are either broken CerseiDaenerysJon or irrelevant Bran Arya Stannis . Oh perhaps Wyman Manderly will be the only shining moment left.The plot grew stale drawn out and predictable .We 'll see in 10 years if Martin can recover but I wo n't hold my breath and do not recommend you to do so either .

"Where is this series going ? Does anyone know or care anymore ? I remember the Gunslinger sage from King when I was a kid . Well sadly I outgrew the story and the same thing is happening here . When you have a presidential term between books yet do n't bother to have any plot progression it 's inevitable you are going to lose readers and it 's probable the story will never end.Martin has fallen in love with his prose at the expense of having anything happen . Plus he has this annoying habit of introducing things that seemingly should have some import but sadly never do . Even the Stark direwolves that take up much of the story early on fade away until I 'm left wondering why they were even introduced at all . To a lesser extent I 'm wondering why we met most of the Stark clan . Ned 's death seems like an eternity ago and have Bran Arya or Sasha done anything of significance ? Ever ? Most people liked Book 2 but he spent so much time on Stannis only to have him essentially get a complete do over in book 3 I can only conclude his crushing defeat in book 2 was a mere flesh wound . For all his flaws books 1 and 3 and to a lesser extend 2 were great fun full of suspense and action . Sure there were annoyingly long descriptions of wine drinking what everyone was eating and how they did both but the plot continued to move forward.After thinking about this for a few more days I just wanted to add it appears Martin enjoys writing about the details rather than action and micro versus macro . I recall thinking this as I read the fairly interesting morbid but interesting story arc about Thejon and Ramsey . It really doesnt have any impact on the big picture but he spends a lot of time making sure everyone knows Thejon is a broken man . We already know Ramsey is a sadist but Martin keeps giving us more and more evidence of that for no apparent reason . I remember thinking the same thing about the fight at the wall . Here Martin spent hundreds of pages worrying about the attack explaining the gathering forces etc only to have it stymied by the Wall and 40 or so Crows . Then to cap it off Stannis shows up with a few thousand knights and routs the entire wildling army . Hey it was interesting reading and A LOT of build up but at the end of the day it was much sound and fury signifying nothing . Now we know the real threat is the Others but frankly I 'm thinking if he treats that battle like every other major conflict when it finally arrives it will get a page or two describing it and then it will be neatly wrapped up.At this point I 'm convinced Martin has no idea where he 's going with the story so characters are essentially in limbo as Martin continues his love affair with describing the world they live in . This book is no different . Nothing of significance happens to advance the characters or the plot . We do get told in detail what everyone is eating and drinking and wearing.So it will be another 34 years before the next book comes out and probably 89 before the 7th book . Even if the books were great that would be a long time to expect people to still care about the 20 characters he 's juggling . ",2
"A Song of Ice and Fire is a series that readers must learn to love . The POV style takes some time to get used to but I love it . I approached this book with doubt and fear . Many reviews were negative but they are short sighted . Have patience . People today are so results driven everyone wants the fast answers or the quick fix they do n't have the time to appreciate the journey . This series is a journey . If you want to read about a history of a world that is different to our own yet so similar this is for you . This series is not about the readers or their rush to the outcome . All true readers know that books are about the journey . I have read a lot of books and none have taken me on a journey like these five books have . Those who knock this series I challenge you to focus on the journey and not read to finish the books and you will find these books more enjoyable.Magic wit humor love deception dragons honor are all things you will find in this book . Excellent writing and visual descriptions with a healthy portion of literary meat makes this one one of the best in the series . It 's a marathon not a sprint people are you up for the challenge ?

"Overall the series has its ups and downs and it does inspire mixed emotions . You climax with emotions . I 've read all 5 books in the last 34 months and somewhere in the middle watched the HBO series . The author is without a doubt a literary genius . It 's obvious that the series does seem to drag out . Especially in books three and four . Now a days why not make 7 books instead of just 2 or three $ $ $ . There is no doubt plain as the nose that used to be on Tyrion 's face the author has been stalling . Throughout the series you ca n't help the feeling that there are more questions than answers as you continue reading . The characters that you once despised you ca n't help but feel pity for or should I say secretly cheer for . Dare I say I had emotions as Cersei was taking her walk of shame . I could n't help but thinking this would never have happened if Twyin Lannister was still alive . Or if Tyrion was still the hand of the king . Martin is definitely a master of suspense . No doubt he is cleverly manipulating the reader into feeling anger surprise suspense etc.OK back on track this is a review of the 5th book after all . The Author seems to be getting a second wind . In all honesty I really have learned not to try to predict or hope for anything . JUST READ and enjoy . I ca n't recall what I was hoping for from the inception of my adventure in the George R. Martin books . I think I always wanted the Starks remaining to come back together to Winterfell . Who knows ? The biggest Con of this series and any of its books is the Ocean of characters that actually have depth . There 's only so much time for one or any specific character . So there 's always going to be a feeling that you are n't getting enough of one character or the other . That 's the biggest criticism in this book and entire series . That and the other small thing PLOT RESOLUTION PLEASE ! There is none so do n't expect any . All in all these are the type of books that you have great difficulty putting down . The first book is definitely better than the 5th however the 5th book is still quite good . Anyways in for a penny in for a pound . What are you going to do quit on book number five . You 've already blazed through half of the seriesIn all honesty if there where some more plot resolution and less stalling this would outshine the Tolkien series without a doubt . ",1
"I was taken over by book 1 had to have books 2 and 3 and even enjoyed AFFC . I could n't wait for ADWD and bought the hardback right away but I did n't even finish it . I went to Wikipedia for the last 100 pages of the plot or what is supposed to be a plot . There was a huge increase in distasteful language and descriptions in this volume . I guess this was to make Tyrion and some others more quirky & interesting . The whole Dragon Queen plot became totally Byzantine . I began to skim those portions . Jon 's voice on the Wall became the same thing over and over . In fact the whole book became the same thing over and over . What a waste of money . Before I started ADWD I was concerned about waiting 5 years for the next volume . NowI could care less when it comes out ! What happened ? ",0
"A lot of people waited a long time for this book . When it finally arrived and was as long as it was I expected something to happen . Very little did . It drags big time . Now the wait for the next installment which may never happen . ",0
"I did n't like it at all.it was very hard for me to keep reading it ! It just did n't have it the other books were great ! This book fell short of my expectations ! To bad for the money I spent was not worth it at all ! ",0
"I have been a huge fan of GRRM 's Song of Ice and Fire Series . Admittedly A Feast for Crows had come as a disappointment . But Martin had an explanation for that . He reported on his web site that he had disagreements with the publisher about the scope and content of the book . When I learned that A Dance with Dragons would finally be released this summer I felt confident that Martin would not disappoint his fans again and that he would deliver a novel that was worthy of the first three books in this series . I anticipated spending a few weeks of the summer by the pool with this hefty tome in my hand.It turned out to be a big disappointment and I have put it aside several times to read other things that I wanted to read . I have finally finished it . In the previous books in this series events had unfolded slowly but they had always maintained a sense of tension and drama . Unfortunately things move forward so slowly in A Dance with Dragons that it causes the reader to lose patience . His handling of Tyrian one of the most interesting characters of the previous novels was particularly disappointing . Tyrian sets out to align himself with Daenerys . But after hundreds of pages of his adventures and misadventures he never makes it to her . This is extremely unsatisfying . I would rather have read hundreds of pages of Tyrion interacting with Daenerys . Maybe GRRM plans this for the next novel . But if you do n't have anything exciting to say in this novel why not just move to it immediately ? The plot lines revolving around Jon Snow and Daenerys are somewhat more interesting and suspenseful . Some of the plots surrounding attempts to poison and assassinate Daenerys did hold my interest for a while . Jon Snow has always been my favorite character in the series because of his combination of nobility and complexity . His election to Lord Commander of the Nightwatch and his interactions with Melisandre were also interesting at times . But these story lines were not enough to overcome my overall frustration with the lack of movement in this novel and Martin 's tendency to skip over some of the larger conflicts that have been brewing in the series.This novel was a disappointment but I do n't think that the series has been irredeemably lost . It 's clear that Martin still loves his characters and let 's face it so do we . Otherwise we would n't be criticizing him so fiercely here . I am just hoping that in the next novel there will be some more significant events and major resolutions and that the development of the characters will go hand in hand with the measured unfolding of the story . ",1
"I 'm not sure what happened here but it sure took a long time to happen . I mostly loved all of the other books in this series and waitedwaited yearsfor this volume . What a disappointment.If you have n't read the other books in this series DO NOT start with this bookyou wo n't have a clue . Martin introduces characters one after another and unless you know them from the earlier books you 'll be left shaking your head . But what really astounded me about this book was the way he introduced several characters and then they seemed to drop off the face of the planet you never hear from them again . What 's up with that ? While Dragons does have its moments overall this book is a boreand that 's coming from someone who really loves the Fire and Ice series . It 's obvious that the whole purpose of this book is to set up a sequel . I always thought that the purpose of a book like this was to entertain . It does that after a fashion but not very well.Sadly I have to wonder if Martin has lost interest in his creation . ",1
"I 've been reading George R. R. Martin for over 10 years . I 've bought ever book i could find by him ! I love his writing Have supported hhis work a long time I 'm not really excited about continuing my support however He does n't seem to be an author anymore Apparently he has too many other projects to actually finish his work ",2
"Possible spoilers.I really like Martin 's series but this book is not nearly as good as the others . It was very long winded at times when it did n't need to be and some of the characters seemed to devolve a little Daenarys and Tyrion for example . Although Daenarys finally gets to ride a dragon . Tyrion just whines for most of the book.In the absence of Rob Stark following the delightfully traitorous Red Wedding a new candidate for the Iron Throne is unveiled . Hmmdeus ex machina ? I think so.Some people we think are dead miraculously are not . And one of my favorite characters appears to meet their demise . Although I truly hope it 's a ruse the like others.This book felt like a lot of small moves that should have built up to something epic but never did . I 'm hoping the next book offers some more adventure . We need more battles and sieges . We need this simmering conflict to boil over and consume us . ",3
"If you 're reading this review then you should have already read the first four books in the series . I wo n't give anything away but there are a lot of unexpected plot twists complete with the death of some great characters and some not so great characters.I love all the song of ice and fire series and this is no exception . If you 've read the other books then pick this one up and continue in the amazing world that could only come from the mind of George R. R. Martin . ",4
"The first three books had a plot and just a few point of view characters . Now it is a meandering mess with too many pov 's and not plot with beginningmiddleend . I enjoyed this book but what started as a great series at the pantheon of fantasy fiction is now simply enjoyable . ",0
"My boys got me into this with the new show out . The books go into more detail and the author keeps you in with each chapter he writes . I can not wait for him to complete this series in print ! ",4
"I dig Martin . I think he writes some amazing books . The first three Ice and Fire books are novels I will enjoy for years to come . That being said this book left a bitter taste in my mouth . There was some good Martin here but every time the story circled to Daenerys I wanted to take a nap instead I skimmed chapters . There was a point about 23rds in where I just about jumped up because such an amazing scene happened . Then the book when back to MEHland . The place where Martin seems to have become quite comfortable over the last few years.But I get it . I 'm a writer myself and I know that not everyone will 'get ' your work . I am glad the book is finally out but it is truly about 300 pages long . I wish he would have released the second half of Feast as he talked about so many years ago instead of this mishmash of two books that somehow packs an unbelievable amount of boredom into what HAD become one of the greatest fantasy epics of all time . The time flow is just disjointed and the ending was far from satisfying . Kill your darlings but for crying out loud leave at least a few likable characters around for the next book.The thing is Martin is doing what he loves and people are buying his books like crazy . So go George man more power to you . I just hope that1 . The next book is better and does n't take 6 FRIGGING YEARS ! 2 . He does n't go out like Jordan leaving reams of notes for someone else to finish what he could not.3 . He gets to see this entire epic made on HBO . I know I hope for the same.If you are a Martin fan you pretty much have to read this book . There is simply no way to encompass the entire novel with someone else 's notes before the next book . Unless you just give up.So pick up this massive tome and when it gets slow just smack yourself in the forehead with it . When you come too you will look at the book in a whole new perspective . ",2
"A very strong and well written book that will leave the reader desiring to read the next in the series . There are continuations of the story lines from book four as well which makes it all the more interesting . ",4
"well it 's actually a continuation of book 4 or it runs concurrently with book 4. if this sounds complicated it is . if you have read the 1st 4 books you are already hooked and are dying to know all about ? if you have n't read any of them yet be prepared . this series is no light read for a weekend working on you tan.i knew all of this and i bought it anyway ! if you are fan of A Song Of fire And Ice this will be your cup of tea . if not try rereading tolkiens ring trilogy . it 's lighter and shorter . ",3
"The detailsand twists and turns are awesome . This book was awesome ! Not a lot of battles but great stories . Cant wait for the nect one ! ",4
"As per usual George 's storytelling is crackerjack ! I was riveted and left wanting more which is always the problem with George . I fear that the next installment wo n't be for awhile ! Recommended ! ",4
"This book was just explosive ! Could n't put it down and now I have to wait again for the sixth book . ",4
"Every book in this series has been fantastic and this is no exception . The only complaint I have is that we 're left on a major cliffhanger but it certainly makes wait for the next book full of anticipation ! ",4
"Plenty of reviews here with the same sentiment but I 'll chip in my two bits.Martin got three solid books out of this seriesthen it went off the rails with A Feast for Crows and A Dance With Dragons continues the train wreck . I think his honesty to the story is getting in the way . It is like no character can ever achieve their basic goal or any goal for that matter . Tragedy always ensues which sends the story in yet another new direction complete with 1000 new irrelevant characters . It 's impossible to fall in love with any of the characters.Too many new characters too much useless traveling constant soulsearching by various characters and way too much descriptive prose I do n't know why he has to go into 3 paragraph details about a simple meal or describe in excruciating detail the 4000th coat of arms of some character that you will never hear from again it all grinds the story to a halt.Personally I 'm going to skip the next book and MAYBE pick up the 7th as I do have an interest in what happened to what 's left of the original characters.Damn shame Martin really had something good going on there for a while . ",1
"Martin has split a longer book into two parts a result I think of the problem I outlined in my review of the previous book with a larger number of narrators the writer is sometimes forced to write about a character simply to keep them current in the story . Movement is not action a point exemplified in Tyrion Lannister 's chapters . His purpose in this novel seems only to be to introduce to us the missing Targaryen prince rather than to develop his own conflicts.However the writing does flow forward . I was able to finish reading the book in less than three weeks . Those readers of the previous books will not have to worry that the story here will completely bog down . However he is still no further to resolving some of the mysteries raised in the earlier books . We are no further to discovering who ordered the attack on Bran Stark in book one . For that matter we are no closer to discovering who was behind Ser Mandon Moore 's treacherous attack on Tyrion Lannister during the battle for King 's Landing in book two . Some of these should have been resolved before the conflicts which await us in book six are opened . ",3
"To say that A Song of Ice and Fire is a beloved franchise is an understatement . Many individuals excluding myself felt that George R.R . Martin 's last outing A Feast for Crows was in poor show . It was so strange to see the forums light up with outrage over a book that was by my observation one of the best in the series . Two of the most common complaints were that Feast did n't feature the most beloved characters in the series i.e . Daenerys Tyrion Jon Snow and that it did n't feature a truly memorable scene like the Red Wedding from A Storm of Swords . That all changes in A Dance with Dragons . Written as a companion piece with Feast Dance features all of the northern and western characters that were missing from the fourth novel.More likely than not the most common complaint of A Dance with Dragons will be the tremendous length of the book . Dance is the longest entry in the series and just as the case with Feast it has a certain unhurried feel to it . In all fairness to the complainers Dance 's narrative does overlap with Feast 's narrative for about the first 600 or so pages . It is the investable result of Feast 's own incompleteness and the way its manuscript was culled from that of Dance to begin with.As previously mentioned the three most beloved characters Danny Jon and Tyrion make a return . In fact they carry the bulk of the plot this time around which depending on whether you enjoy their characters could be a good or bad thing . Both Feast and Dance follow the culmination of the third novel Storm and Martin takes great care and deliberation to follow the main characters as Westeros tries to rebuild their nation in the aftermath of the War of Five Kings . There are times in the novel where things are slow going and it makes you wonder whether Martin just threw in the towel and is trying to ride this thing out . But the cumulative effect of the novel once it is over is formidable proving that Martin has n't lost any of his mastery of writing what is considered the greatest fantasy epic of all time . It really takes reading the whole book to appreciate what Martin has created this time around.Up north at the Wall Jon Snow now serving as the 988th Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch has his hands full . The Other 's also known as the undead menace that is destroying everything north of the Wall are driving the Wildling 's towards the wall leaving Jon to figure out what to do about it . On top of that the selfproclaimed King of Westeros Stannis Baratheon is becoming an arrogant nuisance who hopes to unite the entire north by raiding the land.Elsewhere everyone is waiting for Dany Targaryen who has claimed the city of Meereen as her own to make her intentions clear . All are somewhat bewildered by the fact that Dany has chosen to take up residence in Meereen abandoning her claim to the thrown at least for the time being . Dany is determined to do right by the people of Meereen whom she has liberated from slavery by banning that institution entirely . It is a decision that has crippled the economy . It also made a whole mess of people angry and upset at her decision . These people have begun to assassinate her soldiers leaving the city a very unsafe place for Dany and her followers.And finally there is Tyrion fleeing Westeros after murdering his father with a crossbow he finds himself in about the most humiliating and dire circumstances that he has come across thus far in the series . Later in the book we get to see a bit more of what transpired in the lives of Arya Cersei Jamie and the others . Meanwhile underlying everything is the sense that there is fresh chaos about to erupt with the realm . It is only a question of where and when someone will strike the first blow.As expected Martin 's writing is nothing short of amazing . Beyond the prose the editing is something to be marveled . Thousandpage epic fantasy doorstoppers are plentiful but you do n't often find one that manages to balance multiple plot threads and vast ensemble casts so smoothly that readers never get bewildered lost or just plain bored out of their minds.Once you dive into the meat of this novel you 'll know without a doubt that you are back in the Seven Kingdoms where lives are cheap words are wind and winter is coming .

"After the filler book # 4 that simply updated lesser characters Martin returns to the fast paced intrigue of book 3.Plot twists and unexpected events make for an easy enjoyable read . Waiting for Book 6 later this year ? ",4
"I will not get it because I 'm fed up with Westeros the imaginary land where it takes place as well as the characters and the whole thing . Number four got the paper back version was really frustrating and boring . I did enjoy the first two books . Reading number 3 was quite disappointing but I managed to finish it . Reason ? Martin 's a great writer no doubt but as of book 3 the original Storyline and characters start to fade out or just vanish . The remaining ones after some FOUR THOUSAND PAGES are still pretty much the same age Not even Homer 's Illiad does that ! boring It 'is ' a saga only because it all takes place in Westeros . So Westeros IS the main character ! and whores and BLOODY CRUEL MURDERS and bastardborns and MORE cruelty and treasonENOUGHMORE THAN ENOUGH ! ! Too much of the same for me . ",1
"Martin 's forte was his political intrigue and the unexpected way he killed off major characters . Now it seems everyone comes back from the dead the political intrigue goes nowhere and he traded realistic fantasy for stupid absurd talkingtree fantasy . Lots of people are on the move but no one seems to get anywhere . The Reek chapters are so over the top and frequent that I started to hate reading them Oh God not another stupid internal rhyming dialogue was a frequent thought.Martin has really started to let the size and scope of what he 's doing overwhelm him . It took five years for thisseries of unresolved events . I can only imagine how long we 'll wait for more unresolved events new POVs and new stupid rhymes from Reek aka Theon . ",1
"At the beginning it was difficult to follow because of all the new characters he was introducing . But eventually I got into it . The detail that Martin uses to describe someone 's outfit paints an excellent picture.I also enjoy his description of a meal whether a rather simple meal or a 7course meal . Especially since most of what we are dealing with is not something you find in a local 5star restaurant get my mouth starts watering.When reading a couple books at the same time I usually ca n't wait to get back to Martin because his writing is headandshoulder above whatever else I am reading . ",4
"I 'm so disappointed . I love great fantasy and GRRM is one of my favorite writers but this is more like reading a text book with nothing but facts.A Dance with Dragons is just not up to Martin 's ability . ",1
"This book is a little scattered but if you take the time to get into all the characters they wo n't disappoint you . Also some of the storylines have been left behind as well . Looking forward to the next one ! ",3
"I always lose sleep over them staying up well into the night eager for more.I have this awful taste in my mouth as my second favorite character lies bloody and dead or dieing.Why would you end it like this ? ",4
"Much better than book 4 . I struggled through book 4 . I actually quit twice . Book 5 was a breeze to read through . ",3
"Loved this installment . Glad to get ahead a little ahead of the show . So many great stories in thiscersei Bout time she got what she gives Jon Snow please say he 's still kicking ! Arya probably my favorite storyline in the house of black and white ca n't wait til she grows up . Tyrionoh Tyrion laughed so much at his quibbles . DanyDany surprised at her marriage but love Daario the one on hbo is yummy too . Ca n't say enough great things hope I get to read everyone 's HEAthough I 'd settle for JonAryaand Tyrion 's ",4
"Another lengthy novel by Martin wheremore characters are developed and moreexperience their demise . Twists and turnsthroughout with always a glimmer of hopethat the good guys might win . Then againsometimes it is hard to know if there are anyreal good guys with this series . ",3
"GRRM is a god among writers . I grew up with a strong distaste for reading instead preferring the easy entertainment of video games and TV . After discovering the Game of Thrones TV show on HBO i decided to thumb through one of the books . A few short months later i found i had ready every book in the series . If this book can make me like reading for fun i 'm sure it will be an instant hot for anyone . The BEST book series ever written ! ",4
"Simply put the book is long wordy and seems to go nowhere . Everything ends in obnoxious cliffhangers so there 's no sense of closure just frustration.Some of the characters I was most interested in i.e . Bran get almost no mention . I read in an interview where GRRM said that Bran 's chapters were some of the hardest to write because of the magical elements so I guess he fixed that by just not writing any.I wonder how HBO will turn this and book 4 into functioning seasons because the events related in their combined 2000 pages do n't offer much of the breakneck pacing and excitement the show is known for . ",2
"Though the story kept my attention enough to continue reading to the end the storytelling is lacking . Splitting up the storylines into two books that take place at the exact same time is a terrible mistake and only made me lose interest in other characters . Out of all of the books this book has the least action as wellnothing dramatic happens as compared to the sinister nature of the other books.Martin has a lot of work to do to appease his readers in the next book . I hope he can pull it off because otherwise he 's set himself up to a lot of pressure and with the tv series he 's only attracting attention for what may be a dramatic failure . ",1
"I love the entires series . I 'm very surprised this book did n't get better reviews . I thought Feast of Crows was n't his best work just because my favorite characters were in this book but I loved Dance with Dragons . The only complaint I have is that the books are moving more and more towards being a magicdominated book . I really liked it when it was all about winning the iron throne . But it 's not like we all did n't see this coming . It 's been building up to something like this and it 's only going to get more and more like this from here on . The characters are so great that I just do n't care about it at this point.When 's the next one ? ",4
"Martin brings back in to the story elements that were sidelined in Book 4 . More pieces fall into place for what is coming . If you are in this series keep going ! ",4
"I 'm going to write a very brief review of this book so I 'll just cover a few bases . To begin with I think the first three Song of Ice and Fire books are toptier fantasy novels that easily contend with the likes of Lord of the Rings and the Wheel of Time . The fourth book however A Feast for Crows left ol ' Martin 's fanbase decidedly divided . The book to me was basically a wellwritten intermission of sorts that served to move playing pieces into their places . I did rather enjoy it though . Since that book covered the characters from a certain geography only then A Dance with Dragons covers the characters who were not in Feast for Crows . Now since nothing momentous happened in A Feast for Crows and nothing momentous was reported from the other characters offscreen then it should have been a logical conclusion that A Dance with Dragons would be of a similar pace and lowimpact plotting as A Feast for Crows . This turns out to be the case . A Dance with Dragons is really well done but it 's just very slow and not much happens to advance the overall plot . There are some really intriguing events being set up however and since the book is so well done I found myself really enjoying it albeit it not nearly as much as the first three books . I can see why some people are disappointed though . Nothing happens in this book that you would want and expect to happen and since A Feast for Crows was basically a plot doldrum everyone seemed to hope that A Dance with Dragons would be a fireball of epic grandeur . Its my opinion that since the last two books were basically huge intermissions of plot organizing it stands to reason that the final two books of the Ice and Fire series will be mind boggling in scope and action . In any case this book leaves me looking ever more forward to the next installment and let 's just hope the intermission phase is over with . ",3
"this is a fine fat piggy of a book I 'm sure GRRM laughed all the way to the bank it is an incredible 346 pages stretched into 1016 pages . Tons of cliff hangars and Tyrion emerges as a real favorite Liked it and alternated between suffering through it and racing through it . It is a book in desperate need of editing . True fans and members of the cult will enjoy it . I have mixed feelings about it even though I enjoyed oh say 400 pages or so of it . Ah it 's time to stop introducing new characters and to find a way to end it . And therein lies the rub . I am not sure GRRM knows how he will end ths thing . More than anything I hope he will spare us the wights err zombies err frozen dead . ",2
"! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT READ ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Good news for those of you waiting to hear about your favorite characters Jon Daenerys and Tyrion are all here . The bad news is that their storylines are the worst parts of the book . The plot moves at a slugs pace not much really happens to move the main story along at all.Tyrion Tyrion was one of the best characters but there 's only so much of his repetitive wiseguy hijinks that I can take especially when it does n't move the story along at all . Yeah we know Tyrion is a smart a $ $ dwarf that ca n't keep his mouth shut . I can sum up every Tyrion chapter like this Tyrion mouths off Smack Tyrion spits blood . Tyrion insults whoever Kick Tyrion doubles over in pain Tyrion speaks his mind Whack Tyrion groans . Seriously every chapter about Tyrion involves him smarting off and getting a beat down that 's all . Add to that a near death scene and an improbable rescue of Tyrion and you have a lot of disappointing chapters involving your best character.Daenery 's Wow were these chapters tedious . In a nutshell Daenery 's is a bleeding heart that wants to save the world down to the last kitten bunny puppy & butterfly . No child animal or insect left behind at all costs . Oh wait she also cages her dragons . I found myself throughout the book wanting to shake Dany violently and yell Wakeup ! It 's not you the people are following it 's your Dragons it 's not about you and your platinum hair & amethyst eyes it 's about your Dragons and you just caged them up ! Get an F'ing clue girl ! Jon Much like Daenerys Jon has decided to save the world including the entire Wildling population down to the last giant no matter what the cost to his Brothers . Sigh Jon is very stubborn and unyielding much like his father . He does n't listen to anyone around him of the danger he is in yes much like his father . Jon 's chapters were alright except for a huge glaring fly in the ointment part that Martin added . Jon gets a letter from Bolton revealing that Bolton has just destroyed Stannis and is going to be coming for Jon if he does n't comply with his wishes . What does Jon do ? He gets personal and decides to attack Roose and anyone of the Watch that wants to join him is welcome . In other words he decides to commit treason . As Stewie Griffith would say Say Whaaaaat ? Martin has spent the previous books and this one building Jon up as a follower of the rules much like his father and out of nowhere he decides to break the main oath of the Watch Do n't Get Involved . Add to it that Jon is the Commander not just some grunt of the Watch and it just becomes ridiculous totally brings down the book . Unlike others I do n't care a lick that Jon 's is cut down by his Brothers is n't that their duty after all to handle treason ? They were doing their job unlike Jon . But if Jon is brought back to life after basically having his throat cut and belly sliced open I will really be upset and this series will have officially Jumped the Shark . The only thing I 'll accept is if he goes into Ghost a proper name if you think about it . If he comes back with a miraculous recovery or as a wight sungod zombie or whatever the book will be ruined and becomes a farce for me.The book of course contains several other stories about ancillary characters that for the most part go nowhere and add nothing to the story but more pages . But the story of Theon Reek Greyjoy is the one bright spot and probably the best storyline in the book . This book was rather bloated with endless details that only Martin can describe . He does it with great prose in great style but there are only so many descriptions of food you can stomach without becoming bored . His descriptions of food meals and drink were so detailed and exact that I often found myself craving food throughout my read . Martin 's star might be fading in the fantasy fiction world but the Food Channel would be chomping at the bit to get him to market their channel . Another thing that annoys me was Martin 's repetition of the same old phrases . She 's been f'ing Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and probably Moon Boy for all I know . My name is Reek it rhymes with meek . Where do whores go for that matter where do plots go ? Not anywhere fast in this book.It 's not a bad book but for Martin it has to be considered mediocre mess . I can only hope he can tighten up the remainder of his books and not ruin his legacy as one of the best . I know many people will give this book a 1 star review because their favorite character Jon was killed . I 'll just say this basing your review off an emotional attachment to a fictional character is unfair . Life is not a song sweetling . Someday you may learn that to your sorrow . ",2
"I 'll read the next books when they come out but if fantasy fiction at its highest level is supposed to be an epic story of good vs. evil then this book and series falls well short of the mark . I 've read all five books after hearing Martin on an radio interview plugging Dance when it came out . He has created a world that is manylayered and endowed it with history and fable and the characters are interesting although one gets the sense that some of the skinchanging episodes are n't limited to the ones that the author intended . I 've seen one character morph into another across the span of the series.The plot wobbles all over the place with the point being that life is that way I guess . But this is fantasy the reason for the story is that this is supposed to transcend the way life is.Long and complex does n't equal genius however . I 'll read the next books but I 'm certainly not on the edge of my seat wondering how things are going to turn out . Bottom line Martin 's series is slightly above the norm for this genre but to compare him to Tolkien is to compare Quayle to Kennedy . ",2
"After the somewhat disappointing fourth book this one was much better . Would recommend the series to anyone who enjoys the series on HBO . ",4
"From the first book I fell in love with the story and the characters . I read all 4 books and avidly awaited the 5th . Unfortunately I was disappointed in Dance with Dragons . NOTHING is resolved NOTHING is laid to rest . And now I 'm left knowing I 'll need to buy another book if not more just to see how this story resolves itself and what happens to the characters we 've come to know and love.Seriously.if J.R.R . Tolkien can write an incredible and amazing story about the Lord of the Rings in three books 4 if you count The Hobbitone would think George R.R . Martin could wrap it all up in the 5th book.Come on George.finish up the story of the Game of Thrones and start another series I can sink my teeth into and love . I know you 've got more than one story in that creative and talented mind of yours . ",2
"Lovers of WesterosWe all wanted this book to take us back to an age where the lord of bards George R.R . Martin had the guts the energy and the gumption for true storytelling . That is to say We wanted the pace the plot the people and the passion of the first three books . The unfortunate reality however is that this book delivers none of these . It is a commercial product designed to fulfill a contract and to make a publisher money . Of course there is nothing wrong with this . Nothing at all . But do n't think for a second that this treekilling monster is anything more than that.Three things you need to know before buying this tripe1 . There will be no sixth book at least not one written by GRRM . He or his publishers will do what Robert Jordan did . Not a bad solution really.2 . At least half of the five star reviews have been written by GRRM 's friends and fans the same folks who would give five stars to a steaming turd dropped from the Wall so long as it came from GRRM 's well lubricated bowels.3 . Take a look at other major fsf series here on Amazon . Nowhere I mean nowhere will you see such a collection of one star reviews . Do you know why that is ? Because this book is trash . Period . And the world knows it.Remember when GRRM told us fans to get a life ? Back when we were all waiting for FFC ? Remember that ? Time for him to take his own advice.FINAL WORD Trash . Pure and simple.0.5 STARS ",0
"This felt almost like an incredibly good 'fanfic ' book.One that got written 'between ' real books by the author.I enjoyed the stories about the characters but they almostseemed like 'background ' stories . Filling in LOTS of minordetails about what happens between major plot points.With few exceptions barring some bizarre twist of plot in the next book the reader does n't REALLY need to know most of the stuff that happens in this book . I suspect you could skip this book and when you read the next one you would n't realize you had missed one.That said I still enjoyed the read . It was fun to get to know the characters a little better . See them in the mundane day to day activities that is their lives . In a way it gives a little better 'perspective ' to view the earth shaking events . The idea that earth shaking stuff is the EXCEPTION not the rule.I 'm a fisherman and I see it a little like fishing If I nearly always caught 4 or 5 limits of my target fish every time I went out I would call it a bad day when I went out and only caught 2 limits . But if I usually only catch one limit then catching 2 limits is a good day ! I guess I 'm saying maybe GRRM attempted to lower our expectations a little so he can WOW us with just a COUPLE major events in the next book . OR maybe not . But like I said I did enjoy the read even though nothing really momentous happened . ",3
"I 've read all 5 of the existing books and just feel frustrated . I figure I 've read about 3000 pages and just feel a great lack of closure . Worse I feel that this story could go on for ever.Do n't get me wrong I liked the books but I just feel frustrated and more importantly cheated . I feel that the whole story is beginning to seriously drag and was possibly designed that way just to make money . Especially since the author seems to be struggling to complete the work . Likened to J.R.R . Tolkein an American version is flattering but Tokein finished his work . ",3
"A very good book to read the more you read the better it got keeps you guessing at what would happen next good reading ",2
"I found this book in the series to be more ponderous than the previous four . The first half of the book proved to be less interesting and made me feel theauthor was having trouble keeping the story straight . Almost as though he had lost control of his characters . The last half of the book was more interesting and found the path laid out in the previous books . Still enjoy the series and ca n't wait to continue the journey . ",3
"Much better than the last . Interesting developments in plot the story moved well and there was some growth . I ca n't wait to read the next one . ",4
"this book taught me not to start series of books until the last one is published.when i mean if the series is complete i will pick it up again or wait for hbo to finish it ? .i think not sure this book is longer than all of the lord of the rings books combined yet NOTHING happens well enough happens that a 1 page summary can easily suffice i 've seen it done in reviews here.sad to see the greatness of books 13 diminish ",0
"First of all i must say i came late in these series . I saw the tv series and then bought the books so i did n't have to wait 5 years for the last one . Maybe that is why i liked it .Now lets start with my review . It may contain spoilers for those who do not wish to be spoiled ! Yes it did n't have the action that the first 3 had but i had anticipated that much . In order to move the story foward you do need to slow down the pase at some point that was what affc was and adwd . Set the players in key positions for future come . I expect the next one will be full of action and resolutions for our favorite characters . As for the cliffhangers some you saw coming a mile away like John Snow for instance nobody agreed with him or his actions . I do hope he comes clean though i cound n't bare loosing him . As for Stannis it was indeferent to me whether he lived or died and still is for that matter . It was nice to see that Melissandre was not all wicked . But as to who this Azor Ashai is still remains to be seen . Jamie ah Jamie i have grown very fond of him now that he is out of Cercies spell and i see the purpose of Brienne now which eluded me before . I liked the glimpes of Arya but i do wish she was coming back to westeros to interact with someone familiar anyone ! Tyrion i just love him absolutely love him . I was happy he did not reach Denearys . Maybe i am the minority here but i find no reason for him to just be an adviser for her he has so much potential and it would go to waste on her . Yes i do not like the dragon mother anymore . Maybe she should just stay in Mereene and be the queen there now that we have an onther Targarean i say we do n't need her . GRRM has made me change my mind about a character i so loved in the begining and was rooting for her .I enjoyed this book as i did all the others . The wrighting i found the same the discriptions of food the say no more or less than the other bookes . I get why people complain though it has mostly to do with anticipation all those years .The only downfall i saw where the ironborn if they were not in the book it would make no difference to me . Maybe it aludes me i do n't know .I will be waiting for the next one although i do hope it will not take so long . ",3
"I first started reading this book in 2011 when it first came out . If only Martin would FINISH this series . I am too vested to stop reading and I need the closure.All the books are LONG and they drag on a bit . A Dance with Dragons is n't even book 5 . It 's really an addendum to book 4 . I am a bit lost now since it 's been THAT long since I have read the last book . Some of the chapters are a difficult read as I am finding that I use this book to help me go to sleep.I had borrowed this book from my local library back in 2011 . I returned this book to the library after having made it only to page 145 . I could n't NOT put it down translation snooze fest . I was forcing myself to get through a chapter a day but the length of the book and the fact that it was a loaner from the library was too much pressure.UGH the endless details and rambling . Just . get . to . the . point . Lucky for me I was n't one of those poor saps that had to wait umpteen years for Martin to release this one as I had read the other books in the past two years.I bought the Amazon Kindle version this year with a goal that I will read a few pages each day and hopefully get through the end . I should n't punish myself this way I may not ever finish it but if I am having trouble falling asleep I know I can just grab this book and be out in about 15 minutes . ",1
"Good foundation for another book wish it would 've answered more questions . Enjoyed the details . That 's what drew me to the series ",3
"Great read for those that have read the other four 4 Volumes in the saga . Plenty of surprises and disappointments for various characters . ",4
"This book similar to all George RR Martin books is brilliantly written . I continue to have a love hate relationship with most of the major characters . For example as much as I detest the character Cersei I began to feel pity for her in this book . This is the nature and the beauty of the series where no one is completely evil or good . I think the brilliance of the writing makes the disappointing portions glare more brightly than one would see in an average to above average book.Problem 1 Lists and Lists of useless information . During one visit to the wall almost a full page is dedicated to listing all of the shields that were arrayed on the wall by the family name and crest . As with so many of the Martin lists the names are rarely ever seen or heard from again . I have gotten to the point that when I see these lists I usually just read the first and last one.Problem 2 Premature ending . When I finally arrived at page 1000 I began to feel anxious because I knew Martin could not give me the satisfaction of some resolutions before the book was over with only 100 pages left . In a series of this nature it is expected that some plot lines will continue unresolved until the next book but in this case Martin left virtually all plot lines unresolved . I thought this was supposed to fix the problem with Feast of Crows but again I was left wanting . While writing this review I was tempted to fake satisfaction because the book was still an enjoyable read but it is best to let prospective readers understand the book 's limitations.Problem 3 There are still some characters that leave me clueless . I really do n't understand what is going on with Bran . Martin has spent a lot of ink chronicling Bran 's sojourn with mystical undertones but I 'll be darn if I have any inkling how this will impact the story line . What was up with Jon Snow ? He turned from a position of zero intervention with the world of men to a highly political being . Character disconnects and unresolved story lines abound.One would think that with this critique I would have given the book a lower rating but when evaluated based on the writing merit and the enjoyability factor George RR Martin continues to deliver . Now if he can just focus on writing some plot resolutions publish Book 6 withing the next 12 to 18 months and reduce the mundane lists I will find myself completely satisfied.My recommendation is to read it but do n't expect it sate your appetite it is merely a morsel to wet your whistle . ",3
"Outstanding ! ! ! Love this series and am waiting eagerly for the next installment.Very skillful blending of politics warfare magic fantasy and the unexpected . ",4
"I could n't put it down ! Masterfully written the saga continues . The characters are like old friends . I wish I had the next book in my hands . ",4
"Its hard for a 1000 page book to keep your attention but even with all the unnecessary kills I still found this one the most riveting out of the series so far . ",4
"If you 've read the previous books . Then you know what this book is and what it 's about . The continuation of this epic saga was everything I hoped it would be . Well almost . I 'll have to wait until the next installment for many unanswered questions . If you are a fan of the Song of Ice and fire you will enjoy this . ",4
"If I was n't already bought into the series with books 14 and if I had n't waited 6 years for it I would not have finished this book . This book is a perfect example of what happens when you do n't plan out exactly what you 're doing . I think GRRM really screwed up big time with AFFC and now this . He introduced too many PoVs and the book starts to feel really disjointed about halfway through when it seems like nothing happens with many of the main characters just so we can get more of the PoVs in . Characters like Victarion and Asha are super interesting and all but they just do n't advance the overall story.The mark of a series going sour in books and in TV is usually when you watchread a bunch of stuff without anything really happening . There is really no other way to describe this book . Let 's look at some examples minor spoilersTyrion A favorite character to many last we heard from him he was being squirreled off by Varys . In this book he goes across the narrow sea and then does . essentially nothing . If you read the preview chapter for Tyrion on GRRM 's site then you 're pretty much where I am after reading the book.Danaerys This was the biggest travesty of them all . Literally zero movement here.Jon This character had some movement though if you 've read the preview chapter posted on GRRM 's site in 2008 there is really nothing of interest here until the last Jon Snow chapter in the book.Theon This character was pointless and drawn out.Overall as well there is VERY little different in this book.The whole idea of this book is to try and take as long as possible to build stuff up as to make even the smallest changes seem epic . Things like Theon 's escape attempt takes many many needless chapters of labored anguish . Why ? ! The whole book is structured foolishly as well the first half is split about evenly between Tyrion Jon and Danaerys with some Theon sprinkled in . The characters move slowly but it 's acceptable . After the first half the book turns into PoV after random PoV . Asha Victarion Melisandre Barristan it 's just random person after random person and then it brings people back from AFFC . Of course nothing is going to get tied up ! The story basically stops halfway through the book ! This is the problem with this whole 'time split ' thing . He needed more PoVs for AFFC and so now he needs to wrap those PoVs up even though the story does n't need them to continue . Textbook case of good intentions gone wrong . Bit sad to see this happen to a great series . ",1
"Best book so far ! I did n't want it to end . I ca n't wait for the next one in the series ! ",4
"I was captivated even knowing beyond a doubt that this was fiction I was unable to put the book down . The only minor negatives were the unusual use of Martin 's creative language . The use of ser and some of the unusual character names slowed my reading pace but not enough to take away my enjoyment . I was thrilled to see the development of the main character Dany Stormborn from a shy young maid to the true Mother of Dragons . ",4
"Great . Love this series.written well so as to be right in the story itself ca n't wait for another . All characters are interesting and intertwined . So much fun to read.. ",4
"As the 5th book in the Song of Ice and Fire series Dance with Dragons may very well be the final expansion item in the series . This is not a bad thing perse it means that if you understand the pattern of the books the story has not only progressed a great degree but the scope of it has gotten bigger and bigger and bigger . Whereas the first book focused strictly on the perspectives of the Starks Tyrion and Daenerys the second book brought in Theon and Davos the third book brought in Samwell and Jaime the forth book brought in Brienne Cersei the Greyjoys the Soiled Knight of the Kingsguard The Dornish Guard Captain and Reek . Now the 5th book the story being told in parallel with A Feast For Crows brought in the main characters back caught up with the awesome ending that book and then continued forward . And yet as the story has progressed and expanded at the same time it remains manageable compelling charactercentered thoughtprovoking and a sound emotional mix ranging from frustration with people you hate and gratification with people you love.I do have a theory about why there are so many 1 and 2 star reviews . Maybe it 's because this story has drifted well outside the comfort zone of many readers and they simply were n't ready for it . By now you the reader have been consumed into this world that is clearly bigger than you and this story does require some serious comprehension . And I guess given the shallowness of mainstream books like Twilight and the SeinfeldBanya rivalry people prefer material they do n't have to think about.And that 's just unfortunate because a quality story like the one told in Feast for Crows and Dance With Dragons both of which given a long and drawn out 2nd act really does deserve to be told and it deserves to be credited with thought and intrigue . The series has been amazing thus far and unlike most others I have embraced this difference . Here is a book series that immersed me into a world that does n't even exist and I am now torn on several sides trying to figure out how best to rule and control it and how I would sort this political mess out . And because there is just so much there to the point where fantasizing about acquiring the powers of Superman and warping into the world so I can kill who I want save who I want and fix everything is literally an impossible task . That the only purpose in my reading of these books is because I am desperate to see what happens next and I just want to see how it ends . There is no book series that has ever done that to me . And that 's what makes Song of Ice and Fire valuable particularly Dance With Dragons.Now maybe after all that you 're all wondering why I gave this book 4 stars and not 5 . I only give something 5 stars if I think it is either flawless or its flaws are so tiny that they are n't even worth mentioning as flaws . In this case I was a little disappointed with a couple of the character arcs in this book particularly Bran . He 's in the beginning of the book and then a little later there 's this absolutely epic moment that I will not spoil that has to do with him but after thatnothing . Bran has gotten cooler and cooler throughout the story and I really wanted to see more of him but I guess that 's material for the 6th book and this story was largely centered around Daenerys . This is understandable but also a little disappointing because even her story was a little stagnant . There was plenty there but there was a lot of nothing happening followed by one also crazy and epic moment that really changes things but it 's not something you 'd be expecting and it has somewhat rendered what wereare my ultimate hopes for her irrelevant . Not to say necessarily that what happened was bad just that now I 'm a little lost and I 'm still trying to wrap my mind around it.But rest assured Dance With Dragons is a stellar installment in the series and deserves your read . ",3
"Read the first book got hooked and read all the rest . These are terrific . Well written well developed characters . Only bummer is that he will kill off characters you like very unexpectedly . BUT that makes it good . Read them all before the show came out . Like the show too but love the books . ",4
"I really enjoyed this book and I am looking forward to the last 2 to come . I 'm not sure why people were shocked to find out that this story did n't end with this book . If you look at GRRM 's website it shows that 2 more books are slotted for this series before it ends.It is a little hard to wait for the next book since I do n't know how long till the next one but I still really enjoyed how the characters have developed and to which side people are on or how this will end up . There are characters that I hated but now find i am rooting for and hopefully I 'm not wrong in rooting for them.If you are a true fan than the length or time that it takes to read this book wo n't bother you . I 'm a recent fan who read the previous books in about 2 months since I read them at every opportunity from the want of finding out what happens next . If you are a die hard fan of GRRM which it seems like I now am you will enjoy this book just as much as the last ones . ",4
"I waited almost 7 years for this next book in the series and it did not disappoint..but only when reaching the end ! ",4
"It had too many other groups of people I had no interest in . All the characters I am interested in have been killed and now it looks as if Jon Snow has been attacked and killed . What next ? Doing away with Arya & Sensa ? ",2
"This 5th book continues the quest for the rightful heir to the Throne . The awaited 5th book introduces new characters that further unfolds the fight for the throne . It answers some questions of the past and provides surprises that leave to asking more question as you wait for book 6 . In addition to wondering what happened to some of your characters from previous books . ",4
"I wanted more details . Is Bran going to continue to be a mushroom in a hole in the ground ? ? ? And did he try to contact Jon Snow through the crow ? What in the world has happened to Rickon ? ? ? Did Sansa get married again ? ? Is she giving up her heritage ? ? What happened when Breanne was hanged ? Why is n't she dead ? Where did she lead Jamie and why ? Did the others that hung with her die ? ? How many people will come back to life ? Is there a possibility that Lady Lisa will come back to life just as her sister Catelyn did ? ? And how could Ramsay Snow Bolton be requesting the return of his wife if he killed Stannis that is where his wife and Reek went to ? ? Why did Theon become Reek ? And why did n't he spill his guts about not killing off the Stark boys while he was being tortured ? What happened to Samwell ? What happens to Arya ? And is all the vulgar language really needed ? A story can be indepth and well crafted without all the cursing that is a choice . Too many unanswered questions for me . Is Mr. Martin going to drag this out into 100 books ? ",2
"I really do n't understand the negative reviews . This book is much better than the previous one in my mind . If you read and enjoyed the previous books then this one continues with good characters a fully imagined world maybe more so than allows a quick read and interesting plot.I can only imagine that some people are mad that the story is n't finished at the end . ",4
"Martin continues to flow the words into wonderful stories of our now familiar settings . I got interested in reading the series because of the TV show and found myself reading through the entire set so far . Now I am eager to get the next book and find out what else our characters can deliver . Recommended . ",4
"little was resolvedmore questions raised than answered . at least I am still ahead of the TV Series.my favorite characters are still alivefor nonce . ",3
"So despite the last book leaving you a bit bored and less eager to go on this one helps shape things up again ! The story gets fired up and you get a nice cocktail of characters as well like before . You feel like you 're home again sort of.It 's a bit long but what I really did n't like about this one is the chapter titles . I always thought the power behind this series was how the story was told from the point of views of different characters . In this book the titles do n't state names instead weird titles and descriptions that leave you confused till you get a hint of who or where this is . I found myself missing some details that I had to reread once it was clear where this chapter was taking place . It really becomes very annoying ! Still one of the greatest series I ever read The next ones cant come soon enough ! ",3
"I was disappointed in this book ! Most of the main characters have been killed off or wounded so badly that they probably not going to survive . It seemed like he had to maintain a schedule and lost sight of the previous four books . ",2
"I 'm surprised at some of the negative reviews . It 's not great but it borders on being very good . There are lots of mini cliffhangers throughout the book but an observant reader will be able to figure out which ones are faux and which are actually important.Things I thought were great at last there is some Bran . The early scenes with Tyrion were very well written . The new characters he runs into were decently done . Most of the chapters were set in the North always my favorite part of Westerosand were so good I could n't put it down . Martin really goes into the many rammifications of the Red Wedding even into secondary characters like the Boltons and the Manderleys in ways that I did n't expect and that I enjoyed reading.Theres a couple of Martell chapters also some others . set in Kings Landing all pretty good . Plus Asha and Melisandre have some good POV chapters.Things I did n't like so much the scenes with Daenerys but then she was never one of my favorite characters so to me no loss some of the cliffhangers were completely unneccessary and run the risk of Martin jumping the shark by overusing this technique in trying to replicate what he achieved earlier with Lord Eddard 's death and the Red Wedding . If you are a reader for whom this would jump out at you I could see some disappointment . Plus there could have been more Bran Meera and Jojen.Overall it 's really good . New and well written fantasy is hard to find . I 'm glad George Martin continued this story and I 'm interested in how he will further it in the next volume . Very good job . ",3
"The fifth book of George R.R . Martin 's fantasy series improves on the fourth which meandered a bit . The fact that Tyrion one of the most popular characters in the series was MIA in the fourth book meant that I was a bit less interested in the novel than the previous three . Tyrion returns in full force in the fifth book A Dance with Dragons.That is n't to say that there is n't some bloat hereA Dance with Dragons COULD have been trimmed and a good editor would have kept the story more on track here something that was sorely missing from the previous bookkeep in mind that that book and this one were originally planned as a single novel . Nevertheless even with the padding the reintroduction of Tyrion and focus away from some of the lesser characters that dominated the previous novel helps Dragons in the long run.SPOILERSOccurring concurrently with the fourth book the fifth novel finds Jon Snow elected as the Lord Commander of the Night Watch although Snow continues to run into conflict from Janos Slynt who betrayed Jon 's father and helped in his arrest . Arriving to help save the day Stannis and his troops help reinforce the defense of the Wall as the Wildlings stream through trying to escape the Others.Tyrion finds himself an exile in Pentos sheltered by Magister Illyrio at the request of Varys . Tyrion finds that Prince Aegon Targaryen long thought dead is alive having been sheltered by Illyrio with the intent that Aegon will return and resume his role as rightful heir to the throne he is ahead of Daenerys inthe succession . Tyrion ends up being kidnapped by Johan Mormont in hopes that he can regain the favor of Daenerys who banished him for betraying her.Daenerys has conquered Meereen but finds herself uneasy with many of the kingdom 's traditions including the use of the fighting pits where slaves face off against each other to the death . She bans the fighting pits . There ae a series of attacks and murders by the Yunkai and the Volantis throughout the kingdom . She ends up marrying Hizdahr zo Loraq who may have a connection with the Yunkai and Volantis.Cersei Lannister finds herself imprisoned by the Faith of the Seven until she confesses to adultery although she does n't reveal her incest with her brother Jaime nor that King Robert 's children are actually Jaime'swhich leads to her eventual release but she still faces trial for the crimes to which she confessed.END OF SPOILERSAlthough a massive book A Dance with Dragons moves the action and main stories along at a brisker pace than the preceding novel in the series but as I mentioned earlier Dance could still have used some judicious editing to reshape the story and keep it focused . With only two novels to go until the series concludes A Dance with Dragons will keep fans of the series both happy and excited for the next installment . Although Dance is n't quite as briskly paced and could easily have been pared down by at least a third the fifth installmentto meat least got the most important plot elements of Martin 's novel back on track.Recommended .

"EditedI SO much enjoyed the Game of Thrones . up until the author I am theorizing lost interest in the story and decided it was n't worth the effort to tie up all the various plots subplots and myriad storylines.In my initial review I panned this book . I somehow was under the impression that this was to be the last book . In that light I thought it was horrible.As several people have commented I was mistaken . There are two more on their way . whewWhile I still do not PERSONALLY like how this book went and found it inferior to the first four I will hope that the remaining two books do a better job and conclude with the excellent writing of the first four .

"Warning there are spoilers below.I really wanted to enjoy dance bad . As upset as i was with the 5 year wait to get the second half of a mediocre booki was really willing to give it a chance . I bought it the second it came out brought my kindle with me everywhere so i could read it in my down time paid close attention and picked up on little subtle things others might have missed all this and i was still disappointed . not in the Kindle tho this thing is awesome and no I 'm not getting paid to say this . It 's perfect for someone who travels a lot for work.It really boils down to this it does n't feel like Martin enjoys writing about this world anymore . His behavior reinforces this feeling too . It 's like he 's just bored of this world and has lost that energetic spark to create.Reading the first three books it was like a man excited about the world he was building excited about the stories the characters excited about what he was going to DO with them and he wanted to get there as smoothly and quickly as possible . Remember when Catelyn left for King 's Landing in one chapter and then arrived there next chapter ? It 's because the journey was unimportant that stuff was filler what happened to her IN King 's Landing was important.Reading the last two it was like he was n't really sure what to do anymore he could n't figure out where he was going he just had to fill up the pages with something and he kept thinking back and forth on what to write . adding deleting adding deleting this is a worrisome sign when indecision apathy and indifference about a tale begin to rear their ugly head.It 's this energetic drive when you have a story you want to tell . But I did n't get that here from Martin which is disappointing because the man has genuine talent . He just does n't seem to be inspired enough to use it . I never got the impression of a clear vision . I did n't get a sense of his excitement for these characters . It shows up in a lot of ways the tired cliches the empty characterizations of the main viewpoints it feels like Dance was a homework assignment to him a very unwelcome homework assignment . This one was a three bitches and a bastard indeed it was and that feeling comes across in his writing style.I really just feel he 's bored and out of ideas . He 's tired of Westeros he is n't sure what to do anymore and he 's just stringing things along with random WTF moments thrown in to try and maintain our interest and fake excitement . It 's similar to sudden loud sounds or 'GOTCHA ' moments in bad scary movies using cheap tricks to try and evoke a sense of fear when the plot itself can't.There are only a few moments where I get a sense of the old Martin . Reading Theon 's chapters were interesting . Theon actually had an arc an evolution and you got the sense that George enjoyed telling this story . Too bad he had to ruin it with yet another cliffhanger ending . In fact this was one of the few true cliffhangers in the book in my opinion . The other 'cliffhangers ' were never set up properly and are more like 'dangling threads ' that came out of nowhere.We have Jon getting the Caesar treatment Stannis marching on Winterfell Theon and Jeyne escaping Aegon landing in Westeros the situation on the Wall the Pink Letter Too much buildup here with too little payoff ! And then one of the big cliffhanger moments from the first book Brienne gets barely a mention in this ! We are left to deduce what she most likely said and her agreement to lead Jaime to UnCat in return for her life yet another plotline that goes nowhere . At the end of the book effectively nothing big or major has happened that we can see the result of . Dany is basically back where she started realizing she should have gone to Westeros . The entire sideshow in Meereen has effectively accomplished nothing . A lot of interesting things happen to the characters that are ultimately irrelevant . The Others are still persona non grata mentioned only in shadows . Dragons still have n't returned . Stannis has n't really conquered anything meaningful . Tommen is still king . Dorne is still 'progressing ' . The Ironborn are still the same . Not enough major action has happened . I can accept one book of mostly filler but two ? A Dance with Dragons feels like it was written to meet a word count ! What 's next he goes through and increases the font size on all the periods to add some more volume ? He might as well it 'd be just as entertaining.The problem is Martin could have easily given us at least one big climax in this book . You could have given us a Meereen showdown with results you could have given us Jon 's death and obvious rebirth as Azhor Az'hai or whatever you could have given us the Others finally attacking in force you could have given us Victarion or Tyrion meeting Dany you could have given us the battle of Winterfell and the results there are so many things he could have done that we do n't get to see . He could have given us the first use of Dragons in war and that would have fit right in the with the title . I do n't mind cliffhangers but really we should have gotten SOMETHING resolved in this book so it does n't feel like a giant tease.The few redeeming moments for me Selmy Wyman 's awesomeness So young said Wyman Manderly . Though mayhaps this was a blessing . Had he lived he would have grown up to be a Frey . Would you like Freys with that Theon simply do n't add enough to justify book for me.If you enjoy reading detailed prose and seeing a world being built by a very skilled author you might enjoy this . If you 're a huge fan of everything remotely to do with the world Martin has skillfully created then you will find a lot here to fill in the blanks . Unfortunately most of those blanks were blank for a reason we just did n't care . I still don't.If you 're a fan of an engaging interesting plot the sort of plot that we saw in the first three books I 'd give it a pass.PS Martin may denounce us here at Amazon as trolls and sockpuppets but I think that makes a mockery of the good rating system that has made Amazon so useful for people like me in the past . Mr. Martin if you read this please make note of the 'verified purchaser ' next to this review . I 'm a real person with a real opinion . ",1
"My love of GoT started with Season 1 of the HBO series . After the season ended I immediately picked up Book 1 of Martin 's series . Wow ! While the number of characters can get overwhelming the level of intrigue and suspense surrounding each one is addictive ! I 'm pleased at how closely the HBO series follows the storyline of each book and that those variations that do occur add to the story do n't distract or take away from it . As a person who does n't consider myself a big Scifi fan I give this series of books an enthusiastic thumbs up ! ",4
"Gripping ! Follows along the 34 main story lines in chronological order . At times I get the feeling that Martin does not know where he is headed but he just keeps moving on into new and unexplored territory . Needs to get focused and working on the next book or three but bring things to a climax and finish off the series ",3
"Familiar characters are back with interesting story lines . Tied up some loose ends that bothered me from previous books . Ca n't wait for next book ! ",4
"No surprise Martin has done it again . Its is a quick read . Good continuation of the series . Just wish they would publish more frequently . ",4
"It might just be the fantasy nerd in me but I truly imagine that George Martin has himself a set of twentysided dice . My wonderings continue to visualize Martin labeling each of his main characters with a number on one side . He rolls the dice . Death to the winner ! Martin has no loyalty to his characters as realistic as reality in terms of the arbitrary quality of accident purpose and fate . I love this about Martin and the Song of Ice and Fire . But I hate him for it too . This dichotomous relationship does n't end at the life and death of a particular character or twenty . My mixed feelings continue in each of his five books that so far establish the series.The ProseIf you like good writing you 'll love Martin but you 'll detest him in this arena as well . His grammar and diction are impeccablehis syntax superb . Reading ` most ' of his writing is a pleasure but it can also be a tedious journey that mirrors the turmoil of his characters . Appropriate or testing ? An example . Martin might say something like these are far from exact quotesactually I made them up entirely There were many knights at the gathering . There was Garl from the Wolfhead Clan with his bronze shield and iron dagger . Then came Smoot of the Hollow Mountain his hair twisted andetc . etc . This list could mention thirtysome names mostly characters with no role in the plot just providers of depth in a world not lacking it . Martin goes overboard sometimes in the scope and breadth of the grandeur of his fantastical universe . There are many such lists and most are unnecessary to the n'th degree aggravating even . I doubt I am the only reader who skips them almost entirely.I can only imagine Martin 's brilliance at keeping up with it all . The detail is something that makes the series unique and aweinspiring but it also clouds the flow of simply enjoying a good readsomething all fantasylovers share.The Black HoleI wonder if Martin dug himself into a hole reminiscent of the writer 's from the TV series Lost . Can he possibly wrapup the seemingly infinite plot lines he 's created ? He 's a master of the craft and genre so I sure as hell hope so but with only two books left to go in the seriesI have my doubts.I 'm addicted to the ` game of thrones ' as it plays out for readers . Like our own world so many lust for power but when is it too much to maintain the scope of a good manageable story ? Maybe this simply is n't Martin 's concern . Maybe he 's ok if we as readers do n't follow it all or do n't want to follow it all . Stephen King in his book On Writing used the metaphor of a sculptor for the writer and the writing process . As a writer chips away at his story the world character and plot are revealed . Maybe Martin is just telling it like it is sharing the world as he discovers it.But damnit manwill Daenerys ever make it home ? What about this king or that one ? Will he take true power ? Did you really just kill off Snow ? If not what the heck were you doing to us man ? It 's these very frustrations that make me want to readas much as I complain . It 's the same reason I loved the paininducing finale of King 's Dark Tower series when Roland comes to find he 's back at the beginning.But I 'm still worried . I 'll have faith in Martin for nowI just want to see if he can pull it off.ConclusionI do n't regret a word I ready in the fivebook series . I will admit I skipped some and I almost never do this . I savor every word in the genre . But for many reasons I found myself skipping across the more boring sections like a stone across a lake just touching down for a moment to make sure I was n't missing anything . Then I 'd fall back into the depths of goodstory telling and find myself immersed in an unparalleled adventure.I highly recommend A Song of Ice and Fire but be prepared for war . You 'll battle with the effort in the intake the lengthy diatribes into space and the long waits between your favorite characters . But it 's worth it . The toil is Martin 's test to the reader . I hope you 're worthy . ",3
"Not much happens in this book . The one before it I probably read 200 pages as I skimmed through for this one it was probably closer to 50 . There just was n't anything worth stopping for as I skipped around in this empy ghosttown of a book.On a more constructive note The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man 's Fear are still great books you might enjoy instead . ",0
"I am more than happy that none of the plots in this series are completed in this book . Frankly I hope nothing ever gets resolved and the series goes on for another ten books or more . I want to know what happens next but I am having so much fun with the twists and turns the characters and the settings that I really could care less about an ending . Martin writes as if he is producing real history . Real history has no resolution . It just careens into the next set of circumstances carrying characters along like a flash flood in a desert . The characters make the same dumb mistakes as real people . But they learn from these mistakes and go on to the next phase in lifemaking more educated dumb mistakes . I like escaping into this World where I have more questions than answers . And I will bet that those folks who gave Dances a one star review will still buy The Winds of Winter when it comes out.Wow ! The amount of hatred generated toward this book is astounding ! What is even more astounding is the amount of hatred generated at people who liked the book ! Book reviews are supposed to be about literature and not about the level of vitupritude the fan boy cadre can sling at anything they dislike . It is amazing how unlettered we have become as a nation . ",4
"I started reading a Song of Ice and Fire shortly after the third book came out which means I had to impatiently wait years for Book 4 only to be disappointed by a Feast for Crows . But I justified it as it was really only half a story and did n't feature my favorite characters . I resigned myself to waiting for Book 5 and then this came out.A Dance with Dragons finally picks up with the Alist characters again but unfortunately never moves the story forward . I get the distinct impression that the author is just wasting time . I do n't know if that 's because he does n't know where to take the plot or because he wants to milk the success of the TV show . I 'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt and assume the former though as a huge fan of the series I kind of hope for the latter.The sad thing is that the book is still very well written . George R. R. Martin is a talented author and paints a fantastic picture but the last two books do not stand on their own . Books 4 and 5 combined would have made one satisfying book with all the pointless filler and new POV characters removed . I 'm tempted to take my two books apart and rebind them myself sans filler . ",1
"The parts do n't seem to mesh so you have a feeling of being jerked back and forth sometimes between several completely unrelated stories whose chapters were shuffled together and sold as a book.If you are a fan and you are going to stay with it you know you will ! the new characters alone are worth it . That 's good because you do n't hear a lot about old characters.Let 's see what happens nextthere are a million loose ends ! ",3
"The only good thing about this book in the series is the enjoyment I received reading the other reviewers expressing their disappointment as well . ",0
"My daughter has read all the other books in the series and she likes them This will make a very nice gift for Christmass ",4
"This book was incredible . All of your favorite characters are back . Unbelievable plot cliff hangers throughout the entire book . I ca n't wait to book 6 . John snow better not be dead ! ! ! ! ! ! You know nothing R.R . Martin ! ! ! ",4
"I love the Song of Ice and Fire series though A Feast for Crows suffered from Robert Jordan Syndrome in other words splitting the narrative into too many viewpoint characters meant that the pacing of the plot slowed to a crawl . So much so that this book is really the second half of A Feast For Crows.This book is better . The writing is engaging Tyrion is hilarious as hell in this book even when being emo and I care more about the characters in this book than in the other.Buuuuuttttt the plot goes nowhere . GRRM sets up a wonderful predicament for Daenerys in her conquered city . In fact it is the main plotline of the book . And yet everything is exactly as it was at the start of the book . The plot does n't advance.In fact if you picture the world as a chessboard between the beginning and the end of the book only a few pieces have moved . A couple have been removed a couple have been added but for all of the extreme length of the book nothing really happens.It 's a shame really since it was actually a very enjoyable read much more so than A Feast For Crows . Except for a couple wonderful and horrible plot twists you could easily skip this book read a onepage summary and wait for The Winds of Winter . ",2
"Started watching on HBO book is much better helps explain the histories and relationships in the series . Great to buy the grouping so you can keep reading along to the next adventure . Now have to wait for book 6 ",4
"In this book Martin introduces several more variously important characters has several of the characters we know turn into people we do n't recognize most notably Tyrion . He produces plot complication after plot complication.Every thread ends with a cliffhanger . It is as if Martin wants this series to outlive him not figuratively as having its reputation live on but literally . He wants to die leaving his readers wanting more.Fine with me but I 'm done with it . ",0
"This last maybe not ? book in the Game of Thrones series is also a winner . I gave it a 4 star rating only because I am still reading it right now . I have trouble putting it down but have to because of time constraints but I pick it up as soon as I can . I find myself taking my Kindle with me everywhere just so I can keep reading the story . Great book and I recommend it highly . I also hope the series is continued after this book . ",3
"Read this to finish the series if it continues I wo n't be finishing which is unheard of for me . Story line is hard to follow and characters get stale . ",1
"Like the previous book in the series the story just goes on .. and on and on and nothing gets resolved . Martin can spend a full page describing what the participants are wearing at a meeting and then kill off a significant character in a short paragraph . I was entranced with the first two volumes but now getting through the book is more of a chore than an adventure . I keep looking at the percentage left on the kindle and thinking is anything going to happen ? is it over yet ? ",1
"The story is moving in circles and there are too many loose ends . I do n't relish reading another 1000 pages just to find out the story does n't make sense . The last two books were gravely disappointing . I did n't heed the reviews and purchased the book anyway . I regret that decision . ",2
"I have read all five books . I am very disappointed in the ending of this book . You do not get to find out how it all ends . Hopefully there 's another book coming our soon . ",2
"Book 5 . WOW ! True to Martin 's previous 4 books in this series A Dance with Dragons keeps you reading and by the end you want more ! I ca n't hardly wait for Book 6 to come out ! ",4
"I ca n't help but think that GRRM is hoping to get more seasons out of HBO . One book per season so just pad bulk and bull your way through huh George ? On one hand he 's a marketing genius he signed with HBO after the 4th book and just stopped writing until he could release ADWD at the same time as the series began . I ca n't imagine he 'll let readers get too far ahead of the series otherwise it may hurt his profits . Thanks George for stepping on the backs of your fan base to get a better view . This once loyal fan is pulling herself out of the pile NOW . I even cancelled my HBO I 'm so angry ! Maybe he should get Brandon Sanderson to finish it for him since he seems to have gotten lost somewhere down the line . ",2
"This is book 5 and I ca n't wait for book 6 . The series fits together seamlessly and I have read each book twice . That is the way to catch all the intricate plots and subplots . ",4
"After a 5 year wait A Feast for Crows was a turgid disappointment . Martin claimed the second half of the book A Dance With Dragons was already written and hopefully would be published in a year . Instead it was a 6 year wait . Did that set some sort of record ? I was n't going to bother reading this book since there is no way I can recall all the secondary and tertiary characters and story lines but I was enticed by the great HBO television series and changed my mind.Well that was a mistake . A Dance With Dragons is another disappointment . A frustrating barrage of vaguely familiar names and plot lines caused me to give up about 30 % of the way through on Kindle . I could n't sleep one night so I picked up the book again and forced myself to keep reading and fortunately the story picked up.Aside from all the forgotten characters and plots the problem is that nothing much of interest happens . Stories left dangling 6 years ago and some instances 11 years ago are still dangling . Of interest Martin offers up yet another possibility for Jon Snow 's true parentage and shows that maybe some of those characters you thought he gleefully killed off are n't really dead after all.If you gave me a summary of important events in this book it would n't fill up a single page and I could skip reading this book and wait or not for the next book to come out in what ? another year ? or 6 years maybe ? ",1
"I think that many of the reviews and ratings have been way too harsh for this book . There are things that people wanted to happen in this book that did not come to pass yet . This especially holds true for Dany who just seems to have no clue whatsoever what she wants to do and who she wants to be . I definitely feel the pain here as I never really identified well with the settings and characters on this side of RR 's world.But despite the Dany flat tire and a few other ones all of the chapters are great reads . I 've seen it said that this book sets the pieces into play for the next few books and I ca n't agree more . Characters are in place to finish this insanely good series and the best part of this is that I do n't have a clue just how this big thing is going to end ! I thought A Feast For Crows was a pretty average book this one is better though because you get to focus on better characters . It makes me crave the next book which is all I can ask for.45 stars ",3
"despite it 's popularity this series gets worse and worse with each succeeding book . the last volume is so disjointed and unsatisfying that it spoiled the first two which were n't bad . ",0
"I simply must find out what happens in these books so I will read the next installments for sure when they come out . I liked this better than Feast for Crows but less than all the rest . There were some moments of the old ASoIaF fun . BUT.Ending the book this way with dozens of crazy cliffhangers is really tedious in any book . Doing it in an epic fantasy with so many characters is brutal . Doing it in an epic in which each installment takes 6 years ? essentially unforgiveable . I 'm not talking about a big cliffhanger at the end of the book . I mean the last chapter of essentially every single PoV character for about 100 pages . In most cases we are given secondhand accounts of what terrible thing seems to have happened to soandso . We often can not make sense out of the detailswait what just happened ? a battle ? A storm ? Did they really mean that ? End of that PoV . See you in 6 years.So many little details . So many characters . All unresolved . I love the complexity but there is a limit . The first problem is that we know Martin never simply reveals how they end up . E.g . how a certain jailedknight 's cliffhanger from the previous book took multiple chapters to resolve in this book . We know certain details will be implied and never resolved e.g . bloody porridge . But the bigger problem is that we also know the next book if we 're lucky might be published before 2020 do n't laugh and do n't be surprised . I 'd say there 's no chance at all that the series is done before 2020 . Think about that for a minute . You are supposed to remember all these broken threads in SIX YEARS ? ? ! ? Martin 's never been one for exposition especially plot from a previous book . And his newfound fame has made the pace even slower.Even if the next book had been forthcoming in 12 years afterwards already too late it got to be ridiculous . With 30 pages to go I was already tired of it . Really ? That too ? Yet another worst possible thing that could happen and never be predicted ? It was very irritating as I read it and terrifying when I realized I would be waiting probably 5 years before I got the next installment which very well might not even treat with these characters anyway.So this book actually made me mad . If you want to play that cliffhanger game fine . But not when you write less than 3 pages a week . That 's unforgiveable as an author.My prediction ? The TV series which has already shown it is perfectly fine changing the story finishes the whole series before he even starts the last book even if they split all the books into 2 seasons . It will be curious to see how he handles itwill he try to completely change the outcome from the TV ? Could be fun.But probably what he 'll do is just kill everybody that the TV writers leave standing at the end just to prove he can . ",2
"A Song of Fire and Ice started with great promise and was easily one of the most innovative and captivating works of fiction in decades fantasy or otherwise . The first three books in this series were rich fast paced full of unexpected twists and turns dark humerous profane and moving . However the last two books A Feast for Crows and A Dance of Dragons have become bloated unfocused and so full of predictable cliffhangers that the series is in danger of becoming a parody of its younger self . It almost looks as if Mr Martin took the sobriquet of The American Tolkien that was bestowed on him early in this series too much heart and started writing for the ages rather than his readers of the here and now . Perhaps in the year 2050 readers of this series if its completed by then and if people still read may be able to have a perspective where A Feast for Crows and A Dance of Dragons can be seen as brilliant because they set up the remainder of the story in critical and necessary ways . However real genius would have given us poor slobs reading this in real time a more tightly focused and rewarding story . After waiting 10 years for A Feast for Crows and A Dance for Dragons to recapture some of the earlier brilliance of this series like many reviewers here Im not sure I care enough any more to wait another 10 years to see what happens to the story and the characters that are left . ",2
"I 've read the entire series through this book and enjoyed much of it . The characterizations are fantastic . In fact much of what I love about the book has come back to haunt me . Let me get to my point..MAJOR spoiler alert for the whole series When he killed Eddard in the 1st or 2nd book I forget exactly I expected it It was good . But then he started killing off everybody to the point of annoyance . I wanted Joffrey to die a vengeful death and his killing was pathetic . Arya was setup to be a young girl warrior . She never became the character she was setup for . I keep waiting for her to break out in a epic sword battle . Was it really necessary to kill Robb stark and never show retribution against the Frey 's . What 's going on with Bran ? How any books till he flies . Why was Robbs message to debastardize Jon never sent and acknowledged by Jon ? And seriously did he have to off Jon in this book ? Will I read the next book ? Probably . But expect to be disappointed . ",2
"there are to many names and people who offer nothing in the story . some times it goes slowly and with no interest and then it speeds up again . I think the author is trying to keep it long and so he is loosing the main story . ",2
"I could not put this book down having just read the other 4 books earlier it was great to get back to all of the characters and let the saga continue . Anyone who would like a series of books that they will not be able to put down this is it .

You have such a mix of characters some you love and some you just keep waitng for them to get their comeuppencethen you do a turn around and some of those beloved characters are no longer so lovable .

"So to lighten the blow a little first I will make it clear that I am a GRRM fan and a fan of the Song of Ice and Fire series . Like many others I think the first three books were some of the best fantasy books ever written . They held my interest like few others took directions many other writers would not dare to take and had me itching to read the next . I 'm a fan who checked on the status of this book at least a couple dozen times through each year to see how the progress was coming and I 'm a fan who also believes in a writer taking the time he or she needs to do it properly . ",4
"When does a strength become a weakness ? I read the first three books of the series awed by the author 's ability to kill characters who I thought were pretty central to the story and also create new and exciting characters . However in book four and five I am not sure if it works so well . spoiler alert I think the problem is that the story does not move . Characters like dannerys agonize over their decisions for virtually the whole book.Of course I will read the next book when it comes out but I do hope that George Martin moves the stories forward . Not necessarily towards a conclusion but forward . ",2
"While this fifth installment in the A Song of Ice and Fire series is stronger than its most recent predecessor it still does n't match the excitement and overall strength of any of the three earlier volumes in the series . The beginning of the novel was clearly the other half of aA Feast for Crows A Song of Ice and Fire Book 4 which gave the whole book a slightly skewed and convoluted chronology . Once the two plot lines caught up in chronology and the story moved forward from there it started to feel more like a real book and not an oddly jumbled rough draft . It still ended quite abruptly and the prospect of having to wait potentially five years until the sixth book is published is downright depressing But hopefully the wait wo n't be as long as the previous two waits !

"The book is better than the show of course . If you 've read all the other books then this is the next book you should get . ",4
"Although I love the series I have to say that A Dance with Dragons was a well written story with a major content problem . To be fair the book had some highs and I was thinking YES ! Finally the story is getting good but then I was massively disappointed . The book has a confusing and unpleasantly startling conclusion that leaves me wanting more but dreading the end of the story ! I still am in love with the series and I think Martin is a brilliant writer . but I just need to have faith that he will finish the story with the same awe inspiring brilliance that he started it with .

"Like all the books before this one a great read . I could not want for a better book to read than any of the Game ofmThrones ",4
"Okay you get a tiny bit of movement in this one but most of that is accomplished by killing off characters gratuitously particularly those who have behaved honorably . And that 's it . No wonder he writes so slowly ! He 's great at starting things offand very bad at keeping them going . This book rehashes a lot of previous material to the extent of copying whole paragraphs from Book 4 . Frankly I found myself frequently bored and finally frustrated . Having R.R . for middle initials is not enough to make one an author comparable to Tolkien . ",0
"While I understand a lot of the critics have their points after waiting six years there should have been SOME sort of payoff after another 1000 pages but I just could n't help loving the book all the same . The character stories are superb dialog is great the plot flies along and changes direction abruptly all the time simply a great book hands down . The only real negative is now having to wait another six years for the sixth book . ",4
"The previous volumes read easierhow do you say flowed better . The TV series was more interestingthis volume has way less character development . ",2
"I really loved the first three books of George RR Martin 's epic . So when the fourth and fifth book came out in paperback I was eager to catch up on all of the characters after the climactic events in the third novel.I was disappointed by the pacing and character development of the fourth and fifth novel . The fourth and fifth book were meant to be written as a one superbig book and that should have confirmed for me my worst suspicion the author has just written too much and is in much need of an editor . Pacing seemed sluggish and the characters did not really make any meaningful changes as far as I could tell . Interweaving storylines were interesting upon first reading but soon felt a bit too contrived.I 'm no stranger to long books as most every novel I read is at least 600 pages long . I love classics like Count of Monte Cristo and Les Miserables and I love more modern authors who tend towards longer books Shantaram Frank Herbert Neal Stephenson and Iain Banks . Martin 's first three in the series are classicsbut I doubt I will return to these two or the final two once they are published . ",2
"I have a lovehate relationship with this whole series . They are well written in depth full of suspense and just plain epic but at the same time every character I love seems to die . I also do n't really enjoy most of the chapters featuring Dany I feel the author let her storyline get a little sloppy . ",4
"Again this is the best thing going right now . When I finished this book I was desperate for the next installment and remain so to this day . Although SPOILER ALERT Danerys needs to get the hell back to Westeros so she can take back the throne . ",4
"If you 're reading the series you will read this book and you will swallow the bitter pill that it does n't take us quite where or as far as we expected and you will probably still be there ready for more when Winds of Winter comes out . I found this one a little less engaging a little sluggish and a little more frustrating in terms of story arc . It 's still a very good book and it still continues one of my favorite series . The real test will now be if Winds of Winter can pick up the pace and reengage me in the characters and the story as the previous books did . If you were already struggling with the series then this one might be your last . Or you might tell yourself that anyway . When the next volume does come out I 'll wager it 'll be hard not to pick it up to see where all this setup is leading us ",3
"I have about six of these Beautiful cookbooks and I love them . They ARE beautiful in a coffee table picture book sense and the recipes are well crafted . I often have theme dinner parties and I bought this one for a Texas party . ",4
"LOVE this cookbook ! ! Really really yummy recipes and beautiful pictures of various areas of Texas . I 've really enjoyed reading the short history at the beginning of each section on the different parts of Texas as well . The book was in excellent condition the outside cover showing very minor wear and the inside pages in perfect condition . The book jacket was missing but that was not a big deal to me . The price was VERY reasonable as well . A new copy would have cost at least 4 times what I paid . ",4
"This is one of the best and one of the most beautiful cookbooks I have ever seen or used . Great recipes great pictures ! ",4
"I 'm more and more impressed with each cook book I receive from this series . The recipe directions are easy to follow the food is great and the pictures are almost National Geographic like . I really liked this one because I 'm more familiar with the types of recipes being that I 'm a resident in the U.S . I 'm looking forward to more cooking with this wonderful book ! ",4
"Two books with same name but not the same quality of recipes . This one has to me TRUE Texas flavors . I am truely supprised at the difference between the two books . Do not make a mistake and get the one that was first published in the mid 1980 's . Until a friend recently told me about a recipe he tried form Texas the Beautiful I immediately went to my copy and discovered this recipe was not in it a call back to Texas and we both discovered much to our supprise that there were two completely versions . If you like simple genericback of soup can recipes then the first is for you if for bold Texas flavors then this is the one . ",4
"Good solid recipes . I am a seasoned cook and have tried a half dozen of the recipes in this book . They are not too difficult to executebut mostly I just like to look at the pictures . This would make a great gift . ",4
"I now own four books from the Beautiful Cookbook series . This is by far my favorite . The food stylists and photographers for this particular book have raised the bar to a dizzying height . This melange of simple and upscale recipes is presented as downtoearthTexasstyle . You can almost smell and taste the beautiful food . The stylish photos are works of art.The recipes range from the traditional basics to new Texas cuisine . Try to imagine a chilled Cream of Tomatillo Soup served in a bowl of icewith edible flowers and herbs encased in the ice . The ice bowl is easy to make ! Does Hot Crackered Texas Crab with Pecans sound good ? Or ChiliandCheese Corn Husk Muffins with PumpkinSeed Topping ? What about ChorizoStuffed Poblanos with Mango Salsa or Texas HotPepper Shrimp with Avocado Salsa ? And for dessert how about Churros with CinnamonPecan Ice Cream or Blueberry Creme Brulee with Rose Geranium ? I could go on and on about the food and the presentation . These tempting and colorful dishes can all be made by the novice cook who enjoys the preparation . ",4
"I collect cookbooks and happy to include this in my collection . I have reviewed the book and plan on trying several recipes with my new clay pot . ",4
"The book explains the different types of clay cookware available . It also tells how to clean and maintain this type of cookware . It contains lots of great recipes easy enough for even the most beginning cooks ro master . ",4
"One recent Christmas we gave each of our children 's families a clay cooker which came with a small recipe book but they complained that the books did not have illustrations and that there were not enough ideas . This Christmas I bought each of them and myself this little gem of a cookbook much to our group 's satisfaction . We 're looking forward to trying each of the recipes and sharing our own extrapolations of the wonderful ideas in the book . ",4
"This book gives a terrific baseline for clay pot beginners like myself . I found it easy to understand easy to follow and the meals come out terrific each time . Of course we have now started to embellish the recipes with our own improvements but each recipe in the book is a winner . It is a must have if you own a clay pot to cook in . ",3
"Bought this as a Christmas gift along with a claypot roaster for friends who enjoy cooking . It 's a lovely book and my friends said the recipes were excellent . ",4
"The interesting receipes will have to wait until I find a pot to cook in . The one that I ordered arrived in a 100 pieces . They did a much better job of protecting the book during shipment . ",2
"This is a pretty basic cookbook for something labeled best . Basic recipes basic ingredients nothing special . I do n't know if that means clay pot cooking is a forgotten skill or what . ",2
"I bought this at the same time as the Romertopt book and was glad I did . It added to the variety of recipes and I tried several with great success ! ",3
"I bought a clay pot after hearing and reading people just rave and rave about them . The first meal came out underdone . The next came out burnt beyond belief . I just could n't get it right even though I was following the online recipes I had printed out . So for a while I just ignored my Romertopf and wished I had n't spent so much on something I would never use . One day I saw this book in my recommendations and decided to buy it hoping I could dust off my clay pot and actually use it again . Once I got the book I decided to try a whole roasted chicken . I followed the recipe in the book and OMG it came out amazing perfect deliciousI can not go on enough about how great it was . Everything I have made since using this book as a guide has come out just as great . ",4
"Good easy instructions for great meals . It has become a real family favorite . You can even adapt to crock pot cooking with few adjustments . Double duty cooking ! ",4
"For some really good and easy recipes this is the book for you . The only drawback to the book is that there is no nutritional information after each recipe.If this is a must for yiu then skip the book.For me it was not a deal nreaker I lost my original copy and was happy to see that it was still in print ! I enjoy cooking meals from this book as does my family ! ",4
"This book is excellent ! Do I really mean it given the insightful critiques on this page with low ratings for the book ? Yes I do and I give it 5 stars to balance out the reviews . Every dish I 've made so far has been absolutely deliciousfromthe plainer whole chicken and whole turkey recipes to fancier ones like Chicken Tagine with Green Olives and Preserved Lemon andMeditteranean Fish Stew . I ca n't wait to try out more recipes my only regret being that the book is a small compendum rather than a large one with lots of recipes . What you eat however will be good ! So add this to your collection and enjoy it . ",4
"A nice cookbook good pictures interesting but more complicated than anticipated . I passed it on to the library book sale . ",2
"This cookbook is interesting and informative about balsamic vinegar . And the recipes are wonderful . Have tried several and love them all.Highly recommend it . ",4
"Loved this little book on my favorite cooking ingredient . Beautiful recipes lovely photography and would be pefect for your cookbook collection or to give to a friend . ",4
"Designed for those of us who love the taste of balsamic vinegar but do n't know much about it I did n't even know it came from grapes ! this beautifully illustrated niche book is full of fascinating historical tidbits and some tantalizing recipes . Once limited to wealthy families of Modena and Reggio in Italy the syrupy sweetsour treasure known as aceto balsamico was regarded as an heirloom included in a daughter 's dowry and given out in small vials to particularly honored guests . Even now the real thing dating from 1650 can sell for as much as $ 535 for 3 oz . enough to fill only six tablespoons.In explaining how the Reggiano consortium has certified balsamico tradizionale since 1987 the author describes the various grades in heady terms usually reserved only for fine wines making them sound so tempting that one longs for the chance to sample them despite their prohibitive prices . The recipes are zesty even if one must make them with the imitation balsamico they sell in supermarkets and for the most part simple enough to inspire the reader to think of adjusting some family favorites by adding a splash of balsamic vinegar . The Italian Gazpacho Spicy Blueberry Chutney for curries the Mediterranean Vegetable Stew with Parmesan Polenta and the Tomato and Mozzarella Pizza with Balsamic Pesto are some of the savory delights here though I 'll take a pass on the desserts . An excellent book for the adventurous cook though one might wish for more than just 44 recipes . Mary Whipple ",3
"This book had a lot of good information for me . the item was in good shape almost new . It gave me ideas as how to use basamic vinegar in various ways . AS I have not used it in cooking before . great photos . ",4
"This cute little book full of pleasant photos is worth its purchase price for the Mango and Crystallized Ginger Tea Bread recipe alone . ",4
"I bought this book years ago and still page through it for recipes . This is a sweet little recipe book with wonderful photos throughout . I have tried several of the recipes with much success . It is a small book though so do not expect history serving hints or calorie counts . The scones and strawberry jam recipes are terrific . Now that I have changed my diet to totally vegetarian I have revised a couple of the scone recipes to fit my needs and still have success . ",3
"I love a good strong cup of teanot to mention a buttery scone . The recipes in this book are too fancy and time consuming for me and most of the ingredients are difficult to find . Must be nice if you live in a universe where you can actually find the time to throw tea parties such as these . I wish I had n't purchasedbut live and learn . ",1
"I purchased this book as part of a gift . I previewed it and got one myself . Amazon has a good variety of cookbooks . Delivery was quick . ",4
"Tea time every afternoon at 4 pm at my house . The goodies in this book are delightful but dangerous to the waistline . You really should consider a dinner time around 8 pm I usually eat at 630 . Tea time often spoils my appetite for dinner . But I love it . ",3
"I have hers in hardcover on one of my shelves too . Love the way she includes past life information in her books . ",4
"The book provided lightweight diversion when waiting for busses or when nothing is on the TV the setting storyline and characters were cozy in a twee Olde English way but the weak writing style really got in the way . The prose is littered with cliches and lazy terminology including adjectives as 'lovely ' and 'ordinary ' . These words unless used in dialogue is inexcusable in a novel . I could not immerse myself in the story or feel concerned about what what happened next although I ploughed onwards to the end . I also feel an opportunity had been missed to make Mike Sinclair the rector more sinister and interesting . He was the best element of the story and held it albeit a little together . Sadly the characters were flat and the story was too long . ",1
"it 's really hard to take anything about it seriously . I 've read several other Barbara Erskine books starting with Lady of Hay and have finally come to the conclusion that either that book was a complete fluke or I was n't sufficiently observant when I read it years ago because I thought it was a very original and satisfying book that expertly wove the past and present together into a compelling whole and I have not been able to say the same about any of her other books I 've read though until this one I have n't felt as if my intelligence actually was being insulted.This book is extremely formulaic and full of stereotypes not characters . The ghostly incidents in the book are absolutely ludicrous and anyone who takes any serious interest in ghosts and possession will wonder how Barbara Erskine could possibly have done any research in either matter . I realize there is such a thing as suspension of disbelief but when there are SO many books and TV shows out there on haunted locations and how ephemeral the viewing of ghosts truly is it 's a bit much to expect readers to buy even in a book of fiction that there is a town where the ghosts basically appear on demand.But the worst thing about this book to me was how insulting it was to the concept of Wicca . I am not even Wiccan but the heavyhanded inaccurate depiction of Wicca compared to Good guys are Christian mentality stunned me.But I guess Barbara Erskine knows what sells this book is as overthetop and overblown as it gets . ",0
"I loved Barbara Erskine 's Midnight Is A Lonely Place and House of Echoes . I count them among my favorite books in spite of what I feel are weak tacked on endings that seem as if the author had simply run out of ideas and thrown up her hands in defeat.The stories themselves were great suitably spooky and they made a sort of senseinsofar as these things ever do make sense . Ms. Erskine even won my eternal gratitude in that she refrained from overdosing us with romance just because these stories had female protagonists AND were n't gore splashed horror novels.In short now that Barbara Michaels is no longer writing ghost stories I was happy to find Barbara Erskine.Hiding From The Light was however a terrible disappointment.Characters who put themselves directly in front of runaway trains and then act shocked that they get run down tend to bore and annoy meerthat would be Sarah.I KNOW that the story must go on and that peril must be created for the heroine somehow but poor Ms. Erskine seems to have forgotten that tension is only sustained when the heroine seems to wish to AVOID placing herself in harm 's way ! The saddest part of it all is that I really enjoyed the ghost story part of this tale . Had Erskine stuck with the adventures of the ghost hunter T.V . crew or simply with the attempts to keep the dead Witch Finder General how 's THAT for a job title under control it might have made more sense.The plotline of the modern day heroine who is being acted on by forces she does n't even KNOW exist seemed a very good excuse for putting a heroine in danger and therefore worked in the context of the story without making you wish to slap the poor woman senseless.I wo n't even go into the ugly lies hurled at Wicca in this book . Holy moley I 'm a Catholic and I was turned off especially since I ca n't for the life of me see how a connection with and a reverence for nature is synonymous with evil but that is niether here nor there . I fear however that in the not too distant future this book will seem as bigotted and wretched as old stories with evil depictions of Jewish or Catholic people seem now.In short in spite of recognizing Ms. Erskine 's undisputed talent for creating a shivvery ghostly scene the unlikely and stupid characters made this book difficult for me to enjoy . It 's back to rereading Midnight and House of Echoes for this kid.I really do n't like it when cats get killed in my fiction either . No harm to children or cats is a cardinal rule and alas this book broke that rule too.SighI 'm hoping Barbara 's next effort is more enjoyable . ",1
"Page after page this book draws you through a real page turner and a I ca n't put this down type of book I did love it ! ",4
"Up to her usual standard a must read that keeps you wanting more . Look forward to getting the next book of hers . ",4
"I have been a fan of this author ever since I read her wonderful bestselling book Lady of Hay . So I looked forward to reading this her latest book which has supernatural portents and characters from another place and time.In this book the midseventeenth century and the present converge . Ghosts from the time of Oliver Cromwell when Matthew Hopkins the Witchfinder General unjustly persecuted women in some rural communities in North Essex for being witches are stirring . With Halloween on the horizon it is only a matter of time before they make their presence felt.Emma Dickinson a highpowered business executive finds herself inexorably drawn to a quaint cottage in a rural community in North Essex where as a child she had spent some time . Leaving behind her lover and significant other she buys her dream cottage which long ago belonged to a herbalist named Liza who met her end at the hands of the Witchfinder General . When Emma moves into the cottage she begins having a series of nightmares of a past that she can not bear to remember.Unbeknownst to her Mike Sinclair the handsome new rector of her parish likewise finds himself consumed by images of the past . A voice in his head interjects concepts and feelings that are alien to Mike . He is at a loss to explain what is happening and does not know that he is barreling towards a climax that will be decisive in determining whether the forces of evil or good will prevail.The author a master storyteller weaves a tale that is engaging but the quality of the writing however is uneven and some of the characters are not fullyfleshed . Moreover the book could have benefited from some better editing . Nonetheless while the book falls somewhat short of the standards that this author herself has set it is still a moderately entertaining book that fans of the author will in some measure enjoy . ",3
"For reasons that are not entirely clear to her Emma feels compelled to purchase a little cottage she remembers in the village where her family used to summer . In the process she leaves behind her high flying London career and her posh fiance . Emma devotes herself to fixing the house up becoming accustomed to life on her own and introducing herself to her rural community . She loves her new home but something seems seriously amiss . Terrifying nightmares strange goings on in the abandoned churchyard apparitions voices in her head weird weather but Emma will not be frightened off . As summer turns to fall she becomes deeply embroiled in a perilous paranormal situation one that can only end in disaster if she can not stand and fight.Hiding from the Light involves two sets of characters from two centuries the mystery centering upon the witch hunt prosecuted by the infamous Matthew Hopkins . In parts the writing descends into melodrama and some of the characters are laughably hackneyed but the bones of the story are good with some sections quite effective . Recommended to readers who enjoy spooky but not overly gory tales of hauntings . ",2
"and possession and witches if you read this book.I 've been a huge Barbara Erskine fan since reading Lady of Hay . Unfortunately this book at least the regularsize type edition has not been released for sale in the United States yet . Fortunately I was able to order it through Amazon.uk.This is a long virtual doorstopper size book at just over 540 pages this hardcover is a hefty read . Though there were a few spots where it did lag a tiny bit the plot was well done and the action continued to move at a brisk pace keeping my interest through the entire book.Emma Dickson is a successful business woman living in London with her fianc & eacute Piers . During a visit to her dentist she leafs through a magazine and sees a cottage for sale on the Essex coast . It 's a house she remembers from her childhood summers in the country . She immediately senses that she must buy the house . Piers wants nothing to do with it . He loves their life in London and flatly refuses to even look at the cottage . Emma goes out to the country herself falls immediately in love with the house and puts in an offer for it . She buys it against the wishes of her fianc & eacute quits her job and leaves Piers behind in the city . the excitement is just about to begin for Emma.The cottage Emma bought is haunted as is the local shop by longdead spirits who were once in a heated battle one was a witch the ghost in Emma 's cottage prosecuted by the Witch Finder General Matthew Hopkins the ghost in the local shop . The spirits of these people begin a war against each other using the living players in the tiny village pitting one against the other . Slowly a tide of evil builds in the town . Senseless crimes are committed . Life in the village is thrown out of balance . To restore the balance the ageold battle between warring spirits needs to end.I do n't want to spoil the story by telling any more of this tale . Suffice it to say this is a very well written ghost story . You will believe in ghosts when you read it . The tales of the persecuted witches is thoroughly engrossing the glimpses into the past are seamless and the ending is so well crafted that you will believe it could all so easily happen . This was a highly enjoyable read and is a keeper of the best kind . ",4
"What fun ! Safe to read at home but if I was staying at a hotelhomebuilding that was reputed to be haunted I 'd save this one for later . It took a good couple of hundred pages to set the scenes and the characters but then things took off and I could n't put the book down . In some ways I can see cutting some of those characters and still keep the main story but I loved the whole book anyway.Do n't let the page count deter you the paperback was 700+ but with so many short chapters leaving half pages blank leading into the next chapter it was a very quick albeit enjoyable read . ",4
"I really enjoyed this book it is a page turner it made me want to keep reading . The story line was one of the best I have read of hers . I love the mixture of supernatural themes and history . Well worth it ! ",3
"What improvements have been made for the Greenway Ed edition ? There are already major differences in punctuation word choices and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead SO MANY STEPS TO DEATH editions of this novel . There are further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random HouseAvenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & ShusterPocket . There are further additions still in the Bantam Berkley Signet and Black Dog & Leventhal editions . For every publishing house putting out her works there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie 's words and the sound of her voice . What 's the matter with these publishers ? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie ? And what will she sound like twenty years from now ? It 's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them . Please tell me I 'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed . ",4
"I really enjoy this particular Agatha Christie story . Very different from many of her stories set in the Middle East with a very strong female character . ",3
"I listened to this during a long drive from the Bay area to southern California and it certainly made the miles go faster without my vehicle speed going over the legal limit.I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the character voices were excellently produced.I will certainly look for more titles from this producer .

"Hilary Craven the heroine of this story wishes to commit suicide . The sleeping pills are on her bedside table and all is ready for selfimposed death when a knock on the door changes her plans . A young man tells her the story of a nuclear physicist who has disappeared . Hilary intrigued by the drama agrees to impersonate the scientist 's wife and begins an improbable masquerade that leads her deep into Africa to an unknown destination.This is a book you will probably want to read in one sitting because of its breathless excitement which culminates in a surprising ending .

"Most of Agatha Christie novels are murder mysteries . They follow the usual murder mystery formula . Someone is murdered . Enter the detective who must solve the mystery before the murderer strikes again.Destination Unknown is different . It is more of a thriller than a mystery . There are deaths but it is different . And in a total good way . This was a nice break from the murder mysteries and kept me reading until the last paragraph.Definitely recommend it for all Agatha Christie fans . ",3
"A very different read than usual . Some might not like it because of this . Author 's need to experiment with genre 's and it is our right to not read them or not enjoy them . But we should n't criticize the author for trying something new.I found the end a bit rushed after the long build up . It was n't my favorite but still a good read ! Who do you trust ? ",4
"Too bad you ca n't give a book 0 stars I would if I could . I read this book and found it SO boring this might be because I read it when I was 10 . I could n't remember what I had read at the top of the page before I go to the bottom ! This just proves how boring it was . And believe me I was reading other mysteries at the time so I know a good one when I see it . Agatha Christie was NOT a good one . ",4
"Let me start by saying I love Agathie Christie she 's one of my guilty pleasures . There 's nothing cosier that sitting in a lovely warm living room reading an Christie novel while it 's raining outside.That being said this novel is very odd and uninspiring . It 's not one of her typical murder mysteriesand it 's all very farfetched and just barely comes together in the end.Fans of her usual material might seem a bit baffled by this 'novel ' . This probably would have made a fine screenplaybut there 's not enough coherence or guts to it to make it a good novel as such . The characters also are rather forgettable . The climax to the novel as well is all rather odd and unimpressive.A fast read notheless . ",0
"In the 1920s and 1930s Agatha Christie often created novels that were more thriller than mysterybut as time passed she became less and less interested in such material . 1954 's DESTINATION UNKNOWN also published as SO MANY STEPS TO DEATH is one of her few such novels from the latter half of her career.The novel has a topical story line that references the Cold War defections and even the notorious House Unamerican Activities Committee . In the aftermath of her child 's death and a painful divorce Hilary Craven travels to the Middle East in an effort to escape her pastand when this fails determines to kill herself . But her attempt at suicide is foiled when she is confronted with an intelligence officer aware of her intention an intelligence officer who makes her an unusual proposal if you are so determined to die why not do it in a way that would serve your country ? A nuclear scientist has defected his wife rushing to join him has died in a plane crash . And Hilary intrigued agrees to take the wife 's place in an effort to trace the missing scientist and uncover the intent behind his disappearance . It is a mission from which she is unlikely to return alive.Although the premise is interesting the resulting novel reads rather like the outline for a minor Alfred Hitchcock film . Christie writes with her usual expertise but the characters here are not greatly memorable and the story itself falls down a bit toward the novel 's conclusion . Still it is a fast and fun read and fans of the writer will likely enjoy it as a change of pace from her more typical fare . Mildly recommended.GFT Amazon reviewer ",2
"The scientist Thomas Betterton a brilliant young American who developed the ZE Fission technology that can be very important for modern warfare has disappeared suddenly out of England . Has he been kidnapped or did he depart out of free will to work for the enemy ? If Betterton 's wife asks for permission to leave the country for a relaxing trip to Morocco she gets followed by security agent Jessop . It all turns bad when her plane crashes on its way to Cassablanca . Nevertheless she succeeds in continuing her trip but is not fully aware into which beehive she stumbles.First of all it must be stated clearly that this is not a detective story but an atempt at an espionage novel . When Agatha published Destination Unknown in 1954 Ian Flemming had just created his famous James Bond character in the novel Casino Royale . Although Agatha clearly has the intention of making the plot flamboyant and bursting with action she never succeeds in coming close to the fantastic plots that Flemming created . It is clear that the specialty of the Queen of Crime lies in the typical whodunit with Poirot and Marple as the keycharacters and not in novels of espionage . The plot of Destination Unknown is straightforward and although some admirable attempts were made to surprise the reader lacks the level of suspense that normally characterizes this type of thriller.This book certainly does not belong to Agatha Christie 's highlights . But then again it is still remarkable that seen the enormous size of her oeuvre she only wrote but a few really bad books . ",1
"Not the usual Christie fare this spy story keeps you in suspense from page 1 . I thought it was well done although the plot is highly improbable . Like most Christie 's work it focuses more on the psychological aspect than anything else . The writing is good . I could see several serious philosophical questions addressed in a light style through the conversations and thoughts of the protagonists . Being a scientist myself I truly appreciated this piece . ",4
"This 1955 novel is a departure from her more well known cosy series books . This one has none of her more familiar characters like Poirot or Marple the setting is mostly the North African desert and centers on a James Bond type conspiracy complete with secret hideout and mysterious fabulously wealthy mastermind.Hilary Craven has been defeated by life her daughter has died her husband has left her and she has nothing left to live for . She has decided to leave England and in an outoftheway spot in Morocco end it all . Circumstances intervene and instead of a quiet end in a lonely hotel room Hilary finds herself cast in the role of secret agent.This is a rather standard thriller type novel . Although a departure from Christie 's usual fare there are still many of her more familiar motifs . The 'hero ' is a single woman off on a adventure like MAN IN THE BROWN SUIT there is also a 'master criminal ' like the Tommy and Tuppence series or PASSENGER TO FRANKFURT and much of the action takes place in an isolated contained environment . As always in Christie 's work the clues are all there for the reader to follow right up to the surprise ending . ",3
"Another one of Christie 's espionage potboilers contains one of her best female protagonists . Hillary Craven starts out a tragic figure and becomes by the end a clever determined and complex character . Slight comparisons to Passenger to Frankfurt which expands on the disappearing scientist thread more chillingly . As usual Agatha tops off the adventure with some nice final twists . ",3
"I 'm not much of a fan of the thriller genre there 's usually so much detailed intrigue that I ca n't even keep up with what 's happening let alone figure out what 's really going on . So hooray for Agatha Christie ! Her thrillers are plotfocused rather than designed to show off how clever she thinks she is admirably economical and contain some really appealing characters.Hilary Craven is a woman who has lost her husband and child and is seeking escape by travelling to Morocco . But once there she discovers that her problems are within her that there is no escape . She decides to end her life but is interrupted by the practical Mr Jessop . Jessop has previously been encountered investigating the disappearance of Thomas Betterton another brilliant scientist who has vanished without a trace . He suggests that if Hilary is so bent on death she could make herself useful to him while she seeks it . Deciding that she 's up to the challenge and convinced that death is what she really wants Hilary impersonates the wife of Thomas Betterton and heads off into the unknown . She waits for Mrs Betterton 's mysterious allies to contact her and take her to join her husband knowing she will be beyond help if her ruse is discovered . And once she is contacted then the fun really begins.Hilary is a great character the mystery she gets caught up in is a satisfying one and as with all Christie novels there is a great sense of era as the concerns and foibles of the 1950s when this book was written are brought to life . ",2
"I know this book has an indifferent reputation and it is sometimes compared unfavorably to Christie 's preceding thriller THEY CAME TO BAGHDAD . But over the years I 've come to prefer DU to BAGHDAD maybe as I 've grown older and more reflective . The insouciant and devil may care heroine of BAGHDAD Victoria Jones was once more appealing to me and the social comedy of that book remains a delight . But now I am in a Hilary Craven state of mind . If you ask me Hilary Craven is one of Christie 's greatest accomplishments as a character and her gradual transformation during the events of her ritualized suicide is so skillfully done it 's hard to see how it could be improved.At first she is a frightened despondent mess as a result of catastrophes in her personal life a broken marriage and the death of her only child a little girl . She keeps obsessing about Brenda the dead girl and visualizing the pathetic tiny mound of her grave . She decides to commit suicide and nothing is going to stop her . Christie takes you deep inside Hilary 's mind and her decision seems perfectly rational and even moral and then fate knocks at her door . In a way we 've heard Christie tell this story before because a wouldbe suicide turns into the hero of TOWARDS ZERO and we get some idea of her philosophy on the subjectdo n't kill yourself because of the butterfly effect and you never know when you might save someone else 's life if only you live . DESTINATION UNKNOWN shows signs of Christie 's interest in French existentialism and the questions it asks are pretty deep ones . What is the price of personal freedom ? Is freedom an illusion ? In paradisereal or imaginedis there any freedom of choice ? If humans are infinitely adaptable and can get used to anything where is the spark that separates us from the animals ? Is identity itself a learned response ? ",4
"One of Christie 's more atypical books Destination Unknown is much more of a spy thriller than a traditional murder mystery . Brilliant scientists are mysteriously disappearing from all over the world and the British secret service races to discover where they 've gone and why.Hilary Craven a strong and lovely young Englishwoman who is traveling to Morocco to escape from the desperate tragedy of her life finally realizes that she is trying to escape from herself and the pain she carries with her so she decides to end her life . Hilary 's blazing red hair turns out to be a surprising gift however and at this point the Secret Service makes contact with her . Hilary is sent off into the ancient cities of Africa on a wild and dangerous mission replete with the nearcertainty of failure and death.Destination Unknown is a colorful and vivid spy thriller remarkable for its wellpaced character development as Hilary progresses from brokenness and utter despair to strength and courage .

"A thriller type . Her knowledge of the middle east from her husband 's excavations Max Mallowan puts herand usin the picture . Wonderful fun.Often underrated by Agatha purists . ",4
"Speaking from the point of view of someone who has so far read only one Agatha Christie novel as of yet Destination Unknown being it I have to say it 's definitely not what I was expecting . The writing style was sometimes a bit hard to understand but that 's probably just the time difference so nothing to say there . I 've heard that it 's one of Christie 's more adventureesque novels and not as good as her others but being a lover of the adventuremystery blend myself I found out actually quite interesting despite the obvious lack of dark rooms and bodies on the floor . A very different writer telling the same story might have bored me out of the book but Christie managed to spin it in such a way that you did n't get bored of anything . Overall I really liked this book and I can guarantee that I 'll be back for more Christie later ! ",4
"Destination Unknown is a departure from Agatha Christie 's usual work in that it is not a whodunit set in England . Instead it is one of her espionagetype works . I say espionagetype because it starts out feeling like a coldwar spy thriller but ends up being something else . I wo n't say any more so as not to spoil it for anyone.Of course there is no Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple here nor is there any of the slight quirkiness and charm that is often a trait of Christie 's mysteries . Instead Destination Unknown has a more serious feel that shows well Christie 's writing skill.I enjoyed this primarily because I liked the main character Hillary Craven . Main characters make or break books and in this case I connected with Hillary right off and that affinity and connection held throughout the rest of the book.As mysteries go I have to rate this one as slightly better than average . The book starts out with strong suspense and good pacing that continues up until Hillary arrives at her destination . From that point the story stalls slightly until the end when Christie throws in twists and turns in rapid succession . The whole plot is farfetched and not very realistic but it is fun and entertaining and keeps you wondering what is going to happen.The narrator is soso . She does well enough with most of the voices although I did n't care for her hoarse whispery rendition of a couple of the male characters . She did n't do all that well with the American voices either but then I have yet to hear a British narrator who can do an American accent well.All in all an entertaining story with Christie 's typical happy ending .

"As an unapologetic diehard Christie fan I loved this book . However it was one of her later ones and is not a murder mystery . Rather it is a sort of spy thriller . The story is that scientists have been disappearing from their posts all over the world just after WWII . A wife of one of the disappeared men announced her intention to take a trip for her nerves . On the way she dies and the police set up another redhaired woman who resembles her to take her place . This imposter is taken on a journey to an unknown destination in Africa to meet up with her husband . The trip was described so well that I fell into it and almost felt as if I were along for the ride . I think it had to be based on actual trips she took herself . Once she reaches her destination she finds herself trapped with a man who is not her husband but who is willing to keep up the pretense for reasons of his own . How she is finally rescued and falls for one of her fellow captors concludes the story . The plot has the trademark Christie twist at the end but it is admittedly not the mystery she is known for . The remarkable thing about this book is that Christie finally indulges her desire to express her philosphies of life which she always wanted to do but was restrained by her publishers . I marked the bits of philosophy which really did n't relate to the plot and found many of them . A lot of this book sounds autobiographical and may reveal more of Christie 's true self that her official autobiography . Absolutely fascinating and irresistable to a Christie fan like me . ",4
"An excellent mystery Agatha Christie in great form keeps us guessing almost all the way to the end however the ending is rather too improbably dramatic for my taste . ",3
"Most of Agatha Christie 's books deal with established characters such as Poirot and Marple . But there are a few that stand alone . Interestingly most of them focus on powerful people who want to rule the world . Destination Unknown and They Came to Bagdad are two of the best known . Some of her works featuring the powerhungry also include an established character The Rule of Four and Poirot.In Destination Unknown written during the height of the Cold War the reader could be lulled into thinking at the outset that it is a cold war novel between East and West . The reader will be fooled ! It is instead a novel about scientists and others seeking a utopian world where they can work unfettered by governments . Eventually they discover the illusiveness of their searcb and become pawns in a new society created by a megalomanic.Christie mixes a touch of murder and international intrigue into this great read !

"While best known for her mysteries featuring her famous sleuths Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple Agatha Christie wrote many works that did not involve them and often touched on a wide array of topics . Destination Unknown is one of those works that touches upon the fears of Communism during the Cold War . It is an intriguing thriller that will keep readers curious.The story begins with Jessop a British security agent trying to discover why so many of the world 's best scientists have been disappearing . After questioning Olive Betterton the wife of the most recent missing brilliant mind Jessop is certain she will lead them to her husband But when her plane crashes in Morocco and Olive is on her deathbed Jessop knows he needs another plan . Enter Hilary Craven a young woman who looks similar enough to Olive Betterton to fool anyone not familiar with her and with a sorrowful enough past that leaves her fearless of danger and death . She agrees to pose as Olive Betterton but soon finds herself in over her head when she and four others are whisked away in the middle of the night to a strange complex in the middle of the desert . Olive a.k.a . Hilary is about to be reunited with her husband but will he accept this stranger as his wife or give her away ? Can she find the answers that Jessop and the authorities of other countries have been looking for ? Or will she get swept along with the currents of propaganda that have swayed others far more brilliant than she ? Destination Unknown is a fast paced read and a welcome departure from Christie 's other mysteries . The fear of Hilary 's pretense being discovered creates enough suspense to keep the story moving . The incorporation of the fear and lure of communism is an interesting facet that Christie deftly explores . ",3
"Whenever Agatha Christie stepped away from her usual detectives Hercules Poirot and Miss Marple the entire tone of her novels would often shift from mysteries often called cozies on account of their English village settings to espionageconspiracy thrillers . This is especially true of Destination Unknown which spans several countries and a lengthy passage of time with special agents government officials and wealthy masterminds making up most of its cast.It deals with the scenario of several international scientists disappearing without a trace . International governments are getting concerned as to where they 've all gone and whether they 're being kidnapped or going of their own volition . The most recent disappearance is that of Thomas Betterson who leaves a potential lead in the form of his wife Olive . The officials in charge of the case are certain that she knows more than she 's letting on but are finding her a tough nut to crackHilary Craven has nothing to live for . After her daughter dies and her husband leaves her for another woman she prepares to commit suicide . However she is just about to overdose on sleeping pills when she hears a knock at her hotel door . It is a perfect stranger who saw her buying a large quantity of sleeping pills and who has a proposition for her . If she does in fact long for death why not go out in a blaze of glory ? British agents have been tailing Mrs Betterson to Morocco hoping that she would lead them to her husband only for her to die in a plane crash . Since Hilary has a passing resemblance to the dead woman would she be willing to take her place and hopefully discover what happened to the missing scientists ? The setup is ridiculously unlikely and yet utterly compelling . Christie draws out the suspense of where Hilary is going and what she will find when she gets there to perfection crafting a dreamlike atmosphere that is nonetheless grounded in reality by the devastating planning of the secret organization that whisks Hilary and her fellow passengers into the unknown . It would be hugely remiss to discuss what it awaiting Hilary on her strange adventure but I suppose it 's fair to say that after such a magnificent setup any revelation comes as something of a disappointment . Yet perhaps that 's the point as Christie once again draws upon her oftused theme of the inherent smallmindedness of megalomania and the strength of those dismissed as ordinary.Destination Unknown is certainly not one of Christie 's best books . Though most of her mysteries demand a reread in order to pick up on the clues and red herrings strewn throughout the plot the enjoyment of Destination Unknown hinges on the suspense of Hilary 's journey . Once over there 's little reason to revisit it despite the lastminute shoehorning in of a mystery that is only tangentially connected to the rest of the plot . There are a couple of loose ends and some characters that remain unaccounted for but on the whole it makes for an intriguing but light read.Much like a cross between They Came to Baghdad and Passenger to Frankfurt with a dash of Toward Zero thrown in what with a wannabesuicide finding a new purpose in life Christie draws heavily on her own travelling experiences to map Hilary 's journey and her own belief system to explore the nature of power freedom progress and knowledge raising some weighty philosophical questions along the way .

"For those who had enjoyed children adventure books like those written by Enid Blyton or Capt WE Johns this book wouldhave fit right in.Unlike other novels by the writer this book is not a mysterybook but an adventure book . There is no whodoneit thoughthere are few clues left around there is no crime actually defined.Scientists from the West have gone missing . When the wife of one such scientist went on a holiday supposedly to recover from the trauma British agents had her tailed suspecting she could lead them to the whereabouts of the missing scientists . But when her plane crashed and she was seriously injured the trail appeared to go cold . Enter Hilary Craven a suicidal woman who bore a passing resemblance . Offered a more exciting way to die in an almost certainly fatal missiong she eagerly took the chance.Not knowing what she could expect to find the British agents could brief her little except to playitbyear . As they hoped she was accepted as the supposed wife and led to be with her supposed husband . But as closely as the British agents trailed her the adversary was a step ahead to outsmart the shadowers and Hilary found herself in an unexpected place with even more unexpected encounters.Would she survive or would she be exposed as an impostor ? The strangely diverse people she had for travelling companions on her way to the lair of the enemy made her wonder if the whole business was what it really appeared to be.In Hilary the writer had a perfect character for such a mission a person who had no desire for self preservation and could mold herself into another being who had a dual purpose in life one as a impostor wife another as an undercover agent.To paraphrase a line from a popular song when she fooled the others she fooled herself as well and through the ordeal she actually became the force which pushed others to cling on to hope and eventually regaining her sense and purpose of existence.A highly enjoyable book in the cast of adolescent adventure but written for adults .

"I agree with those reviewers that believe that this is not Agathat 's best work far from it . Her foray is mystery and this books attempts to be a thriller which does n't work at all . I can not say that the writing is bad but this entire book is just not interesting . Her other books that have to do with world organizations are much better although also could n't be compared to her regular setting of a family murder . So much of the plot just does n't make sense and apart from the three main characters everyone else remain hazy which is never the case in any of her other books . I have the entire collection and must say that this is her most unsuccessful literary attempt . ",1
"This is not the book that Agatha Christie wrote . There are major differences in punctuation word choices and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead editions of this novel . There are further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random HouseAvenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & ShusterPocket . For every publishing house putting out her works there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie 's words and the sound of her voice . Here the publishers at Collins dissatisfied with their own earlier efforts put still more distance between author and public with a Library Ed edition . What 's the matter with these publishers ? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie ? And what will she sound like twenty years from now ? It 's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them . Please tell me I 'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed . ",4
"This is a little different from the typically fun but frivolous Agatha Christie story . The main characters are more finely drawn than in most of her books whether short stories or novels . The action takes place in a variety of venues and is definitely intriguing not easily penetrated . I think even those who do n't care to read Christie considering her work mind snacks should give this a try . ",4
"When I was a teenager I loved this book . It 's not standard for Christie no but it had such a wonderful feeling of hidden menace and a larger world just beyond the reader 's sight . Stafford Nye was extremely likeable I wish Christie had written more about him.I always felt that the book was an abridged version of what it should have been but it triggered my imagination in such a way that I 'll always be fond of it . ",3
"I rarely able to choose the worst books of an author . But if I have to choose the worst of Christie this one will be it . The spy story did not interest me at all . I tried to finish it since I 'm a big fan of her but it was hard not to fall asleep . ",0
"Agatha Christie wrote several novels that deal with international organizations trying to take over the world . While I prefer her works set in the cozy country estates with families full of suspects this is an enjoyable foray into this type of her work . Tones of neoNazism drug trafficking international finance and a scientific discovery that could change the world are some of the elements that make up this story.The characters are interesting Sir Stafford Nye an unambitious member of the British diplomatic corps caught up in this caper his greataunt Matilda an aristocratic lady reminiscent of Miss Marple in that she has a remarkable memory of things that happened long ago a young girl with three identities who fears for her life and a young man rumored to be the son of Adolph Hitler are among the characters that come to life in this novel.If you like international intrigue stories about spies and world domination I think you will enjoy this book .

"In all of Agatha Christie 's 85 novels I have managed to read two back to back that are not only very much alike but do n't follow the usual murder mystery genre.I found Passenger to Frankfurt to be very different . It follows more a genre of being international intrique . Reading it I felt like I was reading a Robert Ludlum.This book follows a lot of the themes of Hitler fanaticism and there is even an uncovering that maybe Hitler did n't die and instead was exchanged for an imposter and lived the rest of his days in South America.There is a note in the front of this book from Agatha Christie to the reader explaining how the novel is very much fantasy and that is totally true . It could happen possibly but it seems unreal in many ways as well.It definitely has n't been my favourite . I was n't on the edge of my seat and everything only started making sense about 34 of the way through and I 'm not sure I really understood anything by the end of it.I 've heard people say that before about this one.On wikipedia Robert Barnard is quoted as saying Robert Barnard The last of the thrillers and one that slides from the unlikely to the inconceivable and finally lands up in incomprehensible muddle . Prizes should be offered to readers who can explain the ending.Yes not quite the usual from Ms Christie but I shall see what the next one I pick up has to offer . ",2
"I have to be in a particular mood to read Passenger to Frankfurt because it is as Agatha plainly says in her introduction An Extravaganza . You 'll get to experience a little of a German airport a lot of an ancient German schloss a lovely German forest Wagnerian music several interesting characters & several grotesque ones and a little about how the British Secret service works . It is not a parlor mystery like most of hers it 's more like an adventure . But one thing you should know If you want a really good analysis of Hitler & the Nazis you will get one here . Agatha was a chemist 's dispenser in both World Wars & she knew . ",2
"I 'm vacationing in Sam Miguel de Allende . It 's rainy season . And I thought I 'd reward myself with a little Agatha Christie between my more academic reading . What a huge misstep ! I 'm only have way through and I thought let me see if others on Amazon have reacted as poorly as I have to this work . They have ! So far this dreary novel sidesteps logic is extremely talky there is no suspense and politically it comes off as a right wing attack on youth culture and the antiwar movement . Agatha you have never disappointed me before although I did notice a few hints of antiSemitism I ca n't remember now in which mysteries but then I thought I must be imagining it.Now I 'm at page 151 and am forcing myself to continue because you brought me so much joy in the past . Maybe the rest of this tome tomb ? ? will redeem itself . But for those of you who still want to adore Madame Christie make believe PASSENGER TO FRANKFURT does n't exist . ",0
"This book opens with an intriguing situation one in which the central character goes out on a limb and takes up a preposterous proposal from a total stranger . Instead of drawing in with a question and then gradually exposing a clever answer the book just keeps piling up question after question after question . After awhile the questions are not of the charitable sort . It is not just that the story is preposterous . It is that I finished with no idea what on earth THAT was all about . I 'm not even sure what she was trying to say . There was n't a character in it for whom I felt any affection either although a lot of them would be exceedingly hard to live with . I got very tired of the old aunt who was supposedly a bit shallow and intellectually slow and who was yet so extremely insightful at the same time . I wish that in the end it that someone had discovered that the old bat was pulling everyone 's leg the whole time but that never happened . Likewise I had hoped that the author was going to spring it off on us at the last minute letting us know what all those odd leads were about that she was surely not as dotty as she seemed to be but that never happened either.It 's a book that few of us have ever heard of . Let 's just say There is Reason for That . ",0
"Book Club ReviewPassenger to Frankfurtby Agatha ChristieOur book club 's book for February 2008 was PASSENGER TO FRANKFURT by Agatha Christie.Huh ? you may be thinking . And that is exactly why we decided to read this book . We have been reading a lot of books lately by writers who are newer to the field so we decided we would like to go back to one of the classics . But we wanted to read a lesserknown book by one of the greats . And thus was Passenger to Frankfurt elected . Fortunately it 's in print as a massmarket book so it was nice and cheap too ! This is n't a Hercule Poirot Miss Marple or even Tommy & Tuppence book . Rather it is Dame Agatha 's foray into the world of the thriller with plenty of espionage secret identities and even it is rumored the son of Adolf Hitler.In a nutshell the plot concerns the main character of Sir Stafford Nye who awakens after being drugged to realize that his passport has been stolen . He remembers a young woman who 'd begged for his help and then disappearedand then he himself is the victim of a murder attempt . When he does find the young lady he is dragged into a plot of international proportions featuring NeoNazis multiple identities and secrets and betrayals.We felt it was interesting to see Christie in this mode . Interestingly Christie notes in her preface that she considers the book an extravaganza far beyond the scope of her normal books . In some ways the characters are ones we have seen beforeincluding Sir Stafford 's aunt Matilda who 's a bit Miss Marplesque writ large.That said the book is of course filled with Christie 's trademark twists and turns . Because the book is a thriller it 's tough to say too much without giving away key points of the plot . It is believable ? No not reallybut neither were those Frederick Forsyth or Jack Higgins books either . Or Robert Ludlum . But it 's great fun to read if you can put aside your expectations of the typical Christie book . The men in our group particularly liked the book which is actually fairly short by thriller standards and can be gotten through in just a sitting or two.On the negative side you ca n't really say that there 's any major character developmentthe good guys are good the bad are bad except in cases of false identities but you 'll have to read for yourself to get that all figured out . The plot does seem a bit convoluted at times but is n't that what we expect from a thriller ? Christie must have had a lot of fun writing thisnot just solving a little murder but rather getting herself up to speed on plots for world domination.The women were a little less enthusiastic but overall we did enjoy it and recommend it as a good option for something different and fun . We thought it was Christie 's homage to Hitchcock and would have been a great film . ",2
"Passenger to Frankfurt was published in 1970 when author Dame Agatha Christie was 80 years old . The novel is atypical for the Queen of Crime in that it deals with a rebellion by youth . There are no drawing room murders or much character development . Think of a mismash of Brave New World 1984 and dystopian views of society 's future.Sir Stafford Nye is seated in the passenger lounge at the Frankfurt airport awaiting a flight to London . He is accosted by a young woman who begs to dress in his clothes so she will escape from persons seeking to murder her.She dresses in Nye 's cloak and uses his passport . Nye drinks a drugged beer but is later revived . Back in London he meets the mysterious woman . She is Countess Renata Zerkowsi . Renata is part of a top secret team which is combasting the rise of a NeoNazi youth movement being led by a charismatic young leader named Young Siegfried.The Aryan looking young man is the son of Adolf Hitler who fled to Argentina where he married a blonde Englishwoman who gave birth to Franz Josef leader of the New World State . The boy has a Swastiza tattoo on his foot.The most interesting characters are not the pallid Nye but his Aunt Matilda . She voices many of the concerns about society held by author Christie . Also of interest is a fat old woman named Charlotte who is a doyen of the NeoNazi resurgence . As the novel ends Nye and Renata are planning their wedding.The novel contains long sections wherin Christie laments the state of modern society . The novel is often dull.This is one of the last Agatha Christie books I would recommend to a new reader of her countless works of fiction . ",1
"the merits of this work by christie lie as i see them not in the logical procedures of the detectivews work or spy but in the connection between the author 's style and the reason for the novel being wriiten . christie writes from the height of her years that she sought to rationalize the violent changes to society several decades after such horrors should have been expunged when ww2 ended . the world was'nt playing like a gentleman . the style chosen is very similar to that of several noted adventure writers from sir anthony hope whose ruritania adventures are mentioned to sir arthur conan doyle not much liked by christie one should note and specifically his story the final problem which is alluded to in a character which i shall not reveal.it is true that in the late 1960 's espionage novels were very different in style from those that christie knew and assimilated in the early 20century and thus one may feel as though sir anthony hope reappeared not much changed after 90 years but christie is well aware of the discrepancies and presents them in a playful way . the result is not only a fond farewell to a much more sensible and sporting sense of skullduggery but a concious addmission of personal anguish at seeing all sens flee from even the world of crime not only the world itself.nobody blamed sir arthur conan doyle when he wrote serlock holmes into the general attempt to make sense of the horrors of ww1 in the final problem . neither did we grudge superman and tarzan when they fought hitler . can we thus grudge agatha christie 's small and playful lastditchattempt at making sense in a world gone mad ? i do n't think we should or can . this book is fun .

"This novel follows the adventures of Ivar Frederiksen son of a nobleman of the planet Aeneas who has dared to challenge the authority of the Terran Empire and as a result must flee for his life even while searching for some way to secure his planet 's freedom . Having led a pathetically feeble revolt against an infinitely more powerful military force Ivar has no choice but to hide among the various nomadic peoples of his planet hoping that their innate distrust of outsiders will dissuade them from betraying him . He gains an ally in Erannath a large birdlike creature from another empire but no one can say for certain what his real agenda is . The story climaxes when Ivar is introduced to Jaan a prophet who is possessed by a 6millionyearold member of the race of Elders whose archeological remains are venerated all over the planet . Can these two men set in motion forces that will free their people before being captured by Terran police ? This reader found himself not caring well before the halfway point of this tedious book . Indeed the first twothirds of the novel are painfully slow and pointless as various characters are elaborately positioned analyzed and persuaded . Although Anderson 's powers of description are excellent at times even poetic and his use of the Elder Caruith is intriguing his action scenes are too often abbreviated or even skipped showing us only the aftermath of the action . It was probably a mistake to chooseFrederiksen as the main character since he does little of significance until the very end . Instead he spends most of the book running and hiding and there 's very little thrill in this chase since his trackers are seldom close enough or dangerous enough to really engage the reader . Anderson had a good enough idea for this book showing how a rebellious young man of privilege could join forces with a workingclass visionary to shake up the establishment but he took far too long to get his story started and by the time things really got moving it was nearly ended . It 's hard to believe that the average reader will even finish this book let alone enjoy it . ",1
"My star rankings are intended only as a comparison within the very extensive works still available by Agatha Christie . I would say this is a fair to middlin ' late piece by her . Not a recounting of the adventures of any of her series characters this is one of the independent works in which the lead characters are portrayed only once or twice . Focus is on a John Buchan type of hero a diplomat with a sense of humor which has condemned him to posts of lesser status than those to which his abilities qualify him . He is considered to be not serious enough . On a layover after a mission he is confronted by a lady who makes a strange request of him . Give her his enveloping cloak and passport so that she can disguise herself as him and get on the plane to London safely or she will be killed . Intrigued he agrees and thus begins his great adventure . Without revealing anything of the mystery I can say it involves a great conspiracy to take over the world with young people organized to act in all major countries . To my way of thinking Christie gets too involved in spelling out the terms of the conspiracy its conception of people and its plans for the future . This leads her to keep her lead characters in abeyance through more of the book than is good for maintaining interest in them . Most surprising is the way in which she ends the book most abruptly pretty much as if she had just gotten tired of it and closed it as soon she could . No fan will consider any of this personal comment reason not to read the book . Others looking to begin their reading in Dame Agatha should turn to one of the Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple books as these are more representative of her fine stories . ",2
"I was searching for some literary comfort food and picked this book off of my to be read shelf . I thought that I had read most of the Christie novels but picked this up when I could not for the life of me remember having read it . It was sadly not comforting . As you have no doubt figured out if you have read the various reviews of this book it is by no means a typical Agatha Christie.Instead of small characterfocused and closely examined Passenger to Frankfurt is big and surreal and let 's be honest kind of bombastic . Featured aspects are a worldwide youth conspiracy the return of the dangerous Germans and a very unlikely spy thriller.I can imagine that Christie had a lot of fun writing this novel and far be it from me to begrudge her that fun . Actually the best part about the book for the reader is the introduction and in the introduction you get the sense of what drove her to write something like this . The book is n't awful really it just is n't great and I am used to pretty much everything she writes being great.Passenger to Frankfurt is an interesting little oddity for the Christie fan but probably something to skip if you are just looking for a Christie mystery . At least Christie is n't as bad as Ngaio Marsh at writing about youth culture of the 1960s70s so at least that 's some blessing . ",2
"At the Frankfurt airport the diplomat Sir Stafford Nye takes an enormous risk when he gives without questions his flamboyant cloak and his passport to a young woman who slightly resembles himself . But the woman is desperate and tells him that it truly is a matter of life and death . She must take a seat in the airplane from Frankfurt to London and no one must know who she really is because that would mean certain death . Later he understands that she did not exaggerate a bit when he learns who she is and what her real purpose was.Passenger to Frankfurt has nothing to recommend it except for the study it provides of an author in declining years trying to concoct a plot that involves topics like world domination and fascism . The novel subsequently stays always one pace removed from reality and the characters seem to be as lost as any reader would be.Agatha Christie wrote this book as a birthday treat in 1970 the year she became eighty . Fans deserved a somewhat nicer present I think . Even the publisher realized that the story would be hard to sell to the readers and insisted on the subtitle An Extravaganza . ",0
"This spy adventure starts out promisingly with an airport incident that can happen to anyone . However it quickly degenerates into plotlessness lack of direction and a boring lack of suspense . The characters are so grotesque and unrealistic that Christie loses one of her most formidable writing weapons the ease with which her readers normally connect to the characters . I could not connect and after the first few chapters could care less what happened to anyone.Christie uses this novel as a platform to present her ageold world view of a secret society that is plotting for world domination . In it you see a lot of resentment towards the young betraying the total incomprehension this octogenarian had for the generation of the 60s and 70s . She mixes up student protests with leftist tendencies violence for the sake of violence and neoNazi currents all together . Add to that the rambling incoherent conversation style of most characters and you get a befuddled mess.What makes her other novels so great is her usually deep understanding of human nature . Regrettably she does n't show this understanding here . The young are mere hypnotist fodder to be brainwashed by whoever is capable of doing so.Even worse than Elephants Can Remember the only reason to read this is to say that you 're read all of Christie 's books . I just quit halfway . ",0
"Passenger to Frankfurt is quite possibly the worse book I ever finished . I 've read worse books that I gave up on in frustration but this had Agatha Christie 's name on it . She was a great writer . I love her stuff . Agatha would n't let me down . Wow was I wrong.Set in the 1960 's this is a serious departure from her usual drawing room mysteries . Stafford Nye a man working from Britain 's Foreign office is approached by a woman in need of help at Frankfurt airport . After helping her out he is determined to meet her again and is rewarded by being indoctrinated into a secret government clique trying to find out about secret organization that seems to be behind the youth movement taking flower power to anarchical violence . So far so good . Agatha is dipping into the world of James bond you think but then it all goes wrong and I mean ALL.Stafford is quickly taken to the alpine schloss of Charlotte a grossly fat woman who is a major player in the movement but the schloss followers etc falling into a WagnerianneoNazi theme seems more like a Bond movie villain gross and over the top and you have no idea how she is a ` hidden ' leader since everyone knows about her . From there Stafford drops out of the picture as the reader is given the insight to various government cabinet meetings by way of plot exposition which says the world is going to hell in a hand basket as the youth movement is unifying countries destroying airports etc etc . and yet old ladies easily travel about Europe oblivious to all this.Individual scenes hold up . Christie can write dialogue and set things out but the connection between the scenes the development of the plot they are not ` bad ' they are nonexistent . Imagine watching a James Bond film and half way through you stop following Bond and the entire film is then seen from Miss Moneypenny 's desk and you will have a reasonable idea of what a frustrating mess this is.At first you think maybe it was Dame Agatha making a comment on the ` hippies ' of the 60 's she did n't understand but this soon slips by the boards and by the last page you realize there is n't an end . You have no resolution or even an understanding if there was a resolution off stage . It 's as if there were many other chapters but Christie forgot to send them to the printer.In the end this is a mess a waste of time and money and talent that should never have seen the light of day . An early departure from her usual style as she steps into the world of Ian Fleming starts out well but half way through it completely falls apart . If you love mysteries if you love spy stories if you love Agatha Christie if you love the freaking spoken wordstay the hell away from this mess ! ",0
"This was my favorite Anderson novel . Dark and foreboding gothic feel to life on the run . Although the setting was a distant planet I would n't call this story core nor necessarily memorable science fiction in the Asimovian classification . It could have been set in Afghanistan or more appropriately prehistoric northern Europe with a futuristic set of props . Further it was a little difficult to establish plot but gave me a sense of a caravan or covered wagon train on the run in the American West . Still I now wish I had kept my copy I would be reading it again . ",2
"First off let me say that i am a huge and dedicated fan of the great Dame Agatha Chrisite . I have read almost all her books and i think she is the greatest mystery writer ever.However this rather fantastical effort is a departure from her usual murder mysteries into the murky world of espionage and the discovery of an anarchistic conspiracy run by neoNazis . The net effect is an amateurish and boring plot burdened by superfluous characters and a lack of exposition.The main character seems to be likable Sir Stafford Nye who is actually quite an interesting persona until he is inexplicably dumped halfway through the book in favour of a flyonthewall observation of various Cabinet meetings that are essentially redundant in telling the reader that the danger faced is very serious and mysterious . There are also long abstract and irrelevant dialogues between monodimensional characters that make Agatha Christie seem at sea with a genre that is apparently too big for her.When the mastermind behind the conspiracy is uncovered we see a brief flash of the old Christie as the culprit is someone whom the reader never suspects . However the epilogue instead of explaining the culprit 's motives or the fates of the various conspirators is instead a humorous yet unsatisfactory marriage between Sir Stafford and another character.Several times during the narrative I found the courage and fortitude to continue only by telling myself that the ending would be as brilliant and fulfilling as all her previous novels yet once again I was thoroughly disappointed with this sad excuse for a novel ",0
"As with the other reviewers that gave this work a low rating I am also a fan.Perhaps as some have said it is the departure from the much loved Poirot Marple and even Tommy and Tuppence that makes this a less than enjoyable read.In any event the book started out fine but soon found its ' way into a plot that was so convoluted and unbelievable that I finally gave up.I did skip to the end and found that even there the wrapup was nothing that gave me reason to regret the time I saved by not reading the remainder of the book .

"This 1970 novel is definitely not one of Christie 's usual cozy style of mystery . It is instead a thriller type of story involving a worldwide conspiracy of Neo Nazis that has much more in common with James Bond than Hercule Poirot.While returning from a trip to far east for the Foreign Office Sir Stafford Nye was approached by a young woman who had an interesting request . She wanted to borrow his passport and distinctive traveling cloak to escape killers who were stalking her . Sir Stafford agreed to help her which set a strange and exciting adventure in motion . Within a few weeks Sir Stafford found himself on a trail that lead throughout England to Germany and beyond . His fellow travelers included the beautiful woman that set things in motion scientists diplomats mystery men and his Great Aunt Matilda and one of her old school mates.Even though this is a departure from Christie 's usual work it is still a well crafted story full of red herrings and interesting quirky characters as one would expect from Dame Agatha . We are also treated to a visit from Mr. Robinson the shadowy figure of international intrigue that has appeared in some earlier works . ",3
"This book is sort of a sequel to The People of the Wind . It takes place many years after the first book and does n't involve any of the same characters . It is a sequel only in that it takes place in the same universe and explores the same alien races.Unfortunately the dialogue in this book is so poorly written as to make the book unreadable . In fact I could n't finish it . I tried but I just had to give up . I 'm not sure what effect Anderson was trying to achieve but it did n't work.This is one for the trash bin . ",0
"Not my favorite Christie . I have nearly all of her books and have read most of them . I had a hard time getting through this one it is not like most of the others . It 's not terrible but not a mustread . ",2
"I really liked this story and the plot was exceptional . The only thing that upset me was the sort of muddled ending . It felt rushed and hurried . She should have left the mystery open with no conclusion . That might have worked better . It was nice to see Mr Robinson again and his trail of money theories . If you do n't expect the usual murder mystery jump into this on different terms and enjoy the excellent narrative style and as usual the more than fascinating characters . That grotesque Charlotte woman was a real kick in the pants ",3
"This mystery is too slowly paced to be of much joy for a reader . However it is vintage Christie so it is worth reading as a mystery if one cares to make the slog . ",0
"I remnember when this book came out and I a child at the time knew something was sadly wrong with Agatha Christie . For years I could n't look this book in the face . But after reading Laura Thompson 's new biography of Christie in which Thompson writes vigorously of PASSENGER as Christie 's late brilliant modernist masterpiece I decided to give it another shot . This time I decided to read it backwards hoping to be able to follow the action a little better if I knew what to look for.Do you know it works very well this way ! I remain sympathetic to the complaint of the reader from April 2003 who said that a large group of good guys none of them the book 's three main good characters trap a pair of the bad guys . You would think that at least one of the main people Stafford Nye Matilda or Renata would show up at the finale in the Scottish highlands but I guess not . I was still shocked out of my wits at the unmasking ! And then reading backwards I discovered that I had many many chapters still to go before the other unmasking when you find out about the big Hitler cult of the golden Siegfried boy from South America ! So for an ordinary reader this would come about halfway through the book the other way and then you 'd be treading water while Admiral Blunt met with Mr. Robinson and Mr. Horsham met with Edward Altamount et cetera et cetera lots of conversations most of them quite grave.I also realized that at heart PASSENGER is a sort of rewrite of Christie 's 1958 play VERDICT her famous flop play which still holds a special place in my heart . PASSENGER devolves liek VERDICT into the story of a refugee woman called Lisa escaped from Hitler 's terror who becomes the assistant to a great scientist based in the British Isles and who falls in love with him even though he is fairly distant to her . This sort of Celia Johnson passion must have meant a lot to Christie and here she gives Lisa in VERDICT her name was Lisa too ! the happy ending she was otherwise denied . I had the satisfying sense of a door closing that perfect click when something unsettled finds its own true way home . ",3
"In There is a Tide Poirot remarks to Superintendent Spence that it 's always the human interest that gets him . I think that is what I like so much about Agatha Christie 's books her incisive and almost brutal analyses of all the people in her books . This is especially well achieved in her books about murders within families . Unfortunately that 's also what this book lacks.Passenger to Frankfurt seems to be Agatha Christie 's attempt to write a thriller . I am not sure how many of these nonmurder mystery books she 's written this is the first one I 've read . It follows a global conspiracy to control the world reviving Nazism along the way . The protagonist is a British diplomat who is aided by a beautiful female spy.The book features some traditional Christie trademarks like the couple falling in love and some incisive commentary about the players in the conspiracy . However most of it felt muddled and incomprehensible and a little dated . I think Christie 's brand of sensationalism works really well for small towns but does n't translate well to global events . I also did n't really understand how each event led to the next and there were way too many characters introduced so I could n't keep track of who was who . The narrative was n't cohesive with viewpoints being switched erratically.I 'd stick to Christie 's murder mysteries . ",1
"I was very disappointed by this book . I am a great fan of Christie 's writing I named my cat Jane Marple and I could not be more ready to enjoy something that she wrote . In this case however I repeatedly put the book down and walked away from it only finishing it because I wanted to see how it ended . Christie wrote it late in her career and the best explanation that I can come up with was that she was coasting on her success and not putting as much effort into this as in her earlier books . Passenger to Frankfurt is a spy novel rather than a murder mystery . It bears a strong resemblance to The Big Four a very successful earlier novel . Both plots center on a sinister organization bent on world domination a threadbare idea at best . It works in Four because of the obvious care that Christie put into creating the intricate plot which while complicated can be easily followed and into the characters the hero being Hercule Poirot who was already a well developed personality . No such effort was spent on this book . Passenger opens in an airport where Sir Stafford Nye a minor diplomat is petitioned for help by a young woman who says that she will be killed if he does n't lend her his cape and passport . He does and the action moves from there . The book is not doomed from the start . As I said Christie can make this sort of thing work and she leaves herself some excellent openings . The main trouble with the book is that it tries to cover too much and tell too little . Christie seems so unwilling to give anything away that large segments of the action are left out and throughout most of the book the reader has no idea who the good guys and the bad guys really are even down to the heroes . By the middle of the book the plot has gotten fairly absurd . This secret society has instigated a youth movement worldwide spearheaded by a handsome young man who they claim to be the son of Hitler . That in itself might not be so bad if she had n't pushed it on to have these youth take over all of South America force Chicago under martial law et cetera . There are also long paragraphs in which the author goes on and on philosophizing about the young . Since the book is copyrighted 1970 it occurred to me that this might at least in part be inspired by the popularity of public protest among young people at that time.I know better than to give away the ending but I will say that I found it very contrived and I did n't feel that she had given the reader enough information to make it really fair.The saving grace of this book is the characters . While some are woefully underdeveloped others make excellent proof of Christie 's talent in this area . The best by far is Sir Nye 's GreatAunt Matilda . Sharp old maids have always been this author 's specialty and the parts in which she appears seem more like genuine Christie than anything else in the book . ",1
"Following up The Rebel Worlds one of the better Terran Empire stories was an interesting move . Removing Dominic Flandry one of his most famous characters from the return visit was a gutsy one . Most of the Terran Empire era stories work because they have someone with personality to spare at the helm driving the action in the plot . Turning the spotlight on other people runs the risk of losing us entirely if we 're not emotionally invested enough in the stakes at hand . And as if to prove a point he never set out to make that almost happens.Still it makes sense . Flandry rarely visited the same place twice and examining events in the aftermath of one of the more heated incidents in the saga . And the premise is sound Aeneas as a planet is a bit shellshocked after discovering that not only did their rebellion fail but that the whole rebellion may have been a Mersian plot to get back at the Empire that only got as far as it did because it got out of hand and ran away from the people who initiated it . While they try to come to grips with it as a people meanwhile the local government from the Empire on the ground is figuring out how they can smooth things over bring them fully back into the Empire and not be you know hated.To do this Anderson divides the plot into three as we follow Ivan a Firstling who can be used to spark a new rebellion or bring everyone together depending on who gets to him first Desai the local Terran commander who does n't want to make everyone miserable but has to ensure that calmer rule prevails and the Empire gets its way and Jaan a former shoemaker who has apparently become possessed by the godlike Builders and is spreading the word that the decision everyone makes can bring the whole world to transcendence . We then proceed to watch all three wander around somewhat aimlessly.This is n't entirely true . But the bulk of the novel oscillates between Desai figuring out the best way to move forward Jaan having constant visions of a philosophical nature and Ivan mostly running from place to place experiencing all the various cultures of the planet . Along the way everyone debates with everyone they encounter the implications of past and future actions and attempt to discover everyone 's motivations and how that can affect things . It 's all very interesting but not really viscerally exciting especially because while Ivan is on the run it never quite feels that way . There 's very little sense of urgency to his portions of the plot and since which way he will jump is the central node the story pivots on it sucks a bit of the life out of things.In that sense and I rarely say this the book probably needs to be longer . The various elements percolate and circle each other but there 's a constant sense of things about to happen as opposed to events actually transpiring and by the time events do begin to occur the book is basically over and we 're into the cleanup and aftermath . What it probably needed was a deeper examination of the world and the cultures as well as a sharper sense of the stakes needed of a world about to tip over the edge and not sure which way it 's going to fall . Anderson still excels in realizing that worlds are not crafted of a single monolithic culture a rarity in SF and populates the planet with a few distinct sets of peoples . Unfortunately it leads to a bit of a travelogue sense of things where Ivan finishes hanging out with the local gypsies and then proceeds to pal around with the analogues for Eastern mystics and so on . That breakneck sense of things about to go wrong that characterized The Rebel Worlds is missing and while it makes the novel a quiet and ruminative piece I 'm not entirely sure that 's what he set out to do.Yet it has its moments . He gets great mileage out of including Aycharaych Flandry 's mortal enemy . Having seen him in other stories as soon as he pops up its a red flag that something is about to go wrong and there 's a delicious moment of intensity where the Terrans realize that the guy they just let walk out the door is probably the most dangerous person on the planet and they need to go track him down . Yet it 's another sign of the relaxed pace of the novel that the urgency such a situation engenders falls by the wayside and winds up being submerged until the very end . Also having Aycharaych involved tends to telegraph the ultimate twist of the book but I do n't think that aspect of the plot was ever more than a feint anyway.Still what Anderson does he does so well it pretty much salvages the lack of excitement . He 's got a better grasp of how galactic politics would work than most of his contemporaries did and he writes aliens with their own distinctive worldviews that are n't immediately understandable . Aycharaych livens things up with menace and the presence of a xenobiological of the birdlike Ythrians adds another layer to scenes that would normally be just Ivan walking around and waiting for the plot to catch up to him.If there is a complaint I would make in retrospect keeping in mind these novels are long written and Anderson long and sadly departed from us its that this section of the saga dealing with the Terran Empire is a bit monotone in its adversaries . When we get to the meat of it it is yet another Mersian plot just like every other story in this sequence . When read all broken apart it probably is n't as noticeable especially since Anderson wrote hundreds of other books but when you 're reading them in order it takes the element of surprise away a bit and replaces it with Oh them again.But it 's a good example on how to write a nice concise political thriller set in the far future and what it lacks in action it makes up for in all the other qualities Anderson brought to his writing . His skill in that respect is kind of invisible the kind you do n't realize how well he 's doing it until you see someone else doing it poorly . ",4
"Passenger to Frankfurt when it was first published was advertised as Christie 's 80th book for her 80th year . It was one of the last books she wrote and it was published when she turned 80 . It should be one of the last books of hers that the reader should take on because it is not classic Christie but is rather a look inside her head one a devoted fan like me is eager to see . She says There is the insidious cult of permissiveness there is the increasing cult of violence . Violence not as a means of gaining money but violence for the love of violence . It was written in the late 60 's published in 1970 at a time when there was a great deal of youth unrest in the world . At that time there were also rumors that Hitler may not be dead . As she usually did she wrote for the times in this book . It is a spy story about the possibility of Hitler 's surviving son trying to follow in his father 's footsteps . It talks about wicked people taking advantage of the naive youth to take over the world . It has a lot of characters who tend to be unconnected and is much slower than usual . Nevertheless it was a smashing success at the time . As always her writing is skillful and thoughtful . It is well worth reading but is better for the reader who has already fallen in love with Agatha . ",4
"I have a battered copy of Passenger to Frankfurt . I should have kept count of how many air miles it has logged with me and others I have loaned it to . This is not your average Agatha Christie mystery . It reads like a Balkan romance only the time period is wrong . The hints of nobility mistaken identity and damsel in distress all combine to make entertaining reading . One is faintly reminded of the Scarlet Pimpernel by the largerthanlife hero . He wears a cape no kidding ! Part of his disguise is his outrageous dress . It is fantastical but then any story would be that postulates the rebirth of the Third Reich . ",4
"I 've always been a huge Agatha Christie fan but this book is a complete departure from her usual work and I hate to say it but it falls short . I always finish reading a book if I start it but there were times when I was really tempted to just put this one down . If you 're looking for classic Christie this is probably not the book for you . I found the beginning quite good but ended up plodding through the rest of it . ",0
"With over 80 detective novels to her credit not to mention an enormous number of short stories plays and even romance novels under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott Agatha Christie is by any conceivable standard a prolific author . Therefore it follows as a logical inevitability that something she wrote must be classed as the best and something else as the worst . I ca n't claim to have read everything the good lady wrote but of those novels that I have read Passenger to Frankfurt easily qualifies as the worst of the bunch.Stafford Nye a rather shiftless easygoing member of Britain 's diplomatic corps who by his own admission enjoys a good joke and takes life rather less than seriously encounters a mysterious woman in the airport in Frankfurt . Appealing to his chivalrous instincts and his desire for a bit of an adventure she persuades him to let her steal his passport and boarding pass and use them to travel to England to avoid what she claims would be her likely murder if she travelled to Switzerland on her previously intended route.Starting from this preposterously unlikely opening scenario Christie takes us on a pointless meandering achingly repetitive thriller that actually constitutes a personal diatribe the aging dowager authoress 's post 1960s current outlook on the world as she rather bleakly perceived it . Neofascism youth rebellion drugs violence armament smuggling hippies skinheads and megalomaniacal financial tycoons bent on world domination all make their appearance in a novel whose plot never truly crystallizes into anything concrete.The current Wikipedia article on Passenger to Frankfurt quotes Robert Barnard a crime writer and contemporary of Agatha Christie who categorized this novel as the last of the thrillers and one that slides from the unlikely to the inconceivable and finally lands up in incomprehensible muddle.I could n't agree more . Not recommended.Paul Weiss ",1
"this book goes practically nowhere at all and is slightly confusing really as to whose side everyone is on etc.But it is not the bad book that most of these reviews seem to make it out as.In all honesty it really doesnt deserve the five star rating i have given it . In fact four stars is a more accurate estimation of it 's quality but i have given it five stars to raise the average . because it really doesnt deserve the two and a bit stars which it currently has.This book has some real plusses . It is brilliantly written . The language Christie uses is probably the best of all her novels . It is more well written and literary than some of them . There are some great characters Stafford Nye Mary Anne Countess Wauldsausen who we see unfortunately little of who really inspire interest in what is a rather perplexing plot . Perplexing why ? Because there is actuall no real plot . It goes almost nowhere and seems a bit pointless . Just written as a device to air some of Christie 's views on the way society is sliding down the drain.Which is where the book does the major credit . The social observations passages about the state of the world its climate its politics the attitude of its people its governments is intensely interesting . Christie 's take on the new youth is very interesting . Anarchy and rebellion ar ethe order of the day and they do permeate this book with a strange sense of fear . Fear for the future and what it holds for us in this strangely unstable world.This plot has a huge scope exploring diplomacy politics forms of rule government vision for the future and the state of the world . In that it is truly excellent . The foreboding doom hopelessness of things is brought across well . This book also has a high count of people just trying to do the right thing in spite of so many people who disagree with them.so as a plot driven novel its not good . But as a novel driven by ideas and notions about the state of world politics then it is excellent . It 's interesting thoughtprovoking with some great characters and a nice prose style.A very different Christie book and for all it 's faults it is one of the great ones . As opposed to one of the excellent or good ones . ",4
"While Agatha Christie is best known for her mysteries featuring Hercule Poirot and Jane Marple she also tried her hand at other stories that were n't straightforward mysteries . Such is the case with Passenger to Frankfurt a novel that could more appropriately be termed a thriller but also one that does n't quite live up to Dame Christie 's usual standards . From the very beginning the novel has an unusual premise but as the story progresses the plot becomes too sidetracked with tangential stories and characters.Sir Stafford Nye arrives at Frankfurt Airport due to a fog delay as he sits waiting for his flight back to England he speaks with a mysterious young woman who has a proposition for him she needs to get into England unnoticed or she will be killed and wishes to borrow his passport and cloak . Sir Stafford Nye wishing for a little adventure accepts the deal only to come up against more questions than answers on his return . He seeks out this passenger to try to find out the truth only to find himself swept up and recruited for some political intrigue . Always game Sir Stafford Nye agrees to help out this mysterious woman and his government to unveil a plot that reeks of world domination.And that is exactly where the plot of Passenger to Frankfurt gets sidetracked the first portion of the book is excellently crafted and mysterious a testament to Christie 's ability to weave an opening that keeps you in suspense but the story begins to fall apart after Sir Stafford Nye accepts his new role as a secret agent . The main problem is that these two characters who 've been developed so far almost completely disappear from the book and the reader becomes a third wheel at meetings of important government people as they try to discover the mastermind behind this conspiracy . Instead of her wellcrafted and intricately ingenious mysteries the last half of Passenger to Frankfurt lacks almost any intrigue and reads like a convoluted castoff from the Cold War with a plot that involves neoNazis living in Argentina and striking up the world 's youth to invest in total anarchy.There are some intriguing things that get said along the way perhaps Christie just bit off more than she could chew with this novel which reads too often like disparate storylines . The resolution comes too quickly there is no build up to the epilogue and very little to tie all of the threads together . I can very easily understand why many people do not like this book but as a fan of Christie 's writing it is interesting to see her take on a different style . ",3
"This books seem to be failed James Bond type spy mystery with neonazis.Even the romance is bollixed between the two central upper class English types.The young Siegfried is a Wagnerian operatic leitmotif that forms a centralplot element . Even the secret weapon is nothing deadlyShe seems to have completely misunderstood the youth movements of the 1960 's . ",2
"Let 's be clear this is not one of Christie 's brilliant works . It is however entirely different from any other book she ever wrote . She tells us before the novel begins that this book is a farce . It is an improbable scenario that actually could exist in the world . A fantastical hypothetical exploration of a what if scenario Admittedly it is sluggish at times but I am glad that I plowed through those moments to the end . While the end wraps up surprisingly fast and has a couple loose ends dangling overall it is satisfactory conclusion to her work . If you can get through the slow parts it is worth a read . ",2

He faces questions that his patriotic idealism ca n't answer so easily What is the nature of freedom ? Of faith ? Can their price be too high ?

"Well after maybe a 35 year hiatus between my last reading of the venerable Dame of Crime Fiction I thought it was time to head back down to St Mary Mead and see what all the fuss was about.The easiest option for me was to have a crack at a few of her Miss Marple short stories and having picked up this charity shop bargain for the humungous sum of 25p when out and about with my wife and youngest daughter on Monday I decided to bump the dame off.sorry bump her up the queue and get started.6 stories & # 8211 142 pages & # 8211 23 hours reading time.Well I can add another female author to the tally and possibly can tick a box on my silver bingo card for my Vintage Mystery challenge I will check later . Two bonus plusses.Verdictwell I did n't manage to guess the culprit or guilty party or unravel the mystery in any of the tales before the big reveal so that was good . And AC can certainly paint a vivid picture for you of her characters in this particular instance a bedbound spinsterwith a good deal of greyishyellow hair untidily wound around her head and erupting into curls the whole thing looked like a bird & # 8217s nest of which no selfrespecting bird could be proud . So another tick there . Thirdly most of the stories engaged me and had me speeding along to the end so I can & # 8217t in all honesty feign indifference.I think what struck me was how unsympathetic most of her victims and villains all appeared to be . In the case of the hidden legacy I did n't like old Uncle Henry & # 8217s beneficiaries and was half hoping that Miss Marple was unable or perhaps more entertainingly unwilling to solve the riddle and therefore deprive the horrible vile rats of their inheritance . I guess Marple though could n't possibly dare to fail . There & # 8217s something a little bit unappealing to me about someone who has to be shown to be the cleverest person in the room all the time . She might just be a little too smug and selfsatisfied for me to tolerate too much of her . Time will tell maybe a longer exposure to our elderly spinster & # 8217s charms will seduce me and have me swooning helplessly in admiration ? The 4.50 from Paddington may seal the deal ! I & # 8217m prepared to be wooed.Last observation I & # 8217m unsure when these were originally written & # 8211 this collection was originally published in 1979 but there are probably too many servants and mistresses or gentrytypes and underlings for me to want to spend too much time in their company . A bit too dated a bit too UpstairsDownstairs a bit too class conscious and a bit too genteel for me . Each to their own but I will probably not read too many of her other books.Anyway I must dashtea and scone time in the drawing room nanny & # 8217s just rung the bell . yummy & # 8211 so toodle pips ! 3 from 5I bought my copy secondhand recently .

"This is a collection of nine short stories one of which does not feature Miss Marple . I always think crime short stories must be one of the most difficult genres to write as there is not space to develop character or show a police investigation.These stories make use of someone telling a story often to Miss Marple . In one case it is her doctor who writes a story and gives it to her to cheer her up when she 's feeling down . Naturally she works out what has happened.I enjoyed all these stories and was particularly taken with ` The Dressmaker 's Doll ' which is really quite spooky and the reader gets a real sense of the possibly evil propensities of the doll concerned . I also liked the last story in the collection ` Greenshaw 's Folly ' which features a particularly ingenious murder . ",4

I enjoyed several of the stories such as Sanctuary but found others to be absurd . The Dressmaker 's Doll and In a Mirror Darkly where really about the supernatural quite unlike what I come to expect from Agatha Christie where the supernatural always ends up having a logical explanation .

"Whose work are we actually reading at this point ? There were major differences in punctuation word choices and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead editions of this novel .

There are further additions still in the recent Signet Berkley and Leventhal and Black editions . For every publishing house putting out her works there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie 's words and the sound of her voice .

Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie ? And what will she sound like twenty years from now ?

"I only wish there were more Hercule Poirot books because I think I 've read them all . Oh except for the last one . I have n't read that yet . Saving it for special occasion . You know the one that was found after Christie died . The Third Girl certainly is n't her best but what could compete with Orient Express or one of my own favorites Murder in the Clouds.But this one is good because it brings back the appleeating mystery writer . I always see her as a good way for Christie to voice her own opinions on the writing process . ",3
"I have mixed feelings about this book . The plot was pretty complex and hard to figure out and I was surprised by the ending all of which I love . I enjoy most Christie novels because they are cozy mysteries . However this one was not so cozy . Usually the people in her books act very differently from people today . They act like ladies and gentlemen with old fashioned manners and style of dress and are concerned about things like honor and reputation . This novel dealt with young people doing drugs having affairs and dressing in the grunge style and there was a bit of espionage . So while it was entertaining it was not much of an escape for me . ",2
"This book first published in 1966 gives us a very different look at London than the wonderful novels Christie wrote in the 40 's did . Poirot amongst the swinging Bohemians ? Well it happens . Christie and Poirot both changed with the times and the result is interesting although probably not her best work.The term third girl refers to a way of leasing flats very similar to the term roommates in the US . One girl rents a flat then advertises for a second and third girl to share accommodations and expenses.Ariadne Oliver once more assists Poirot in this tale of impersonation drugs smuggling forgery blackmail and a young girl who ca n't remember committing a murder.This is a great commentary on English life in the sixties and as always excellent plotting and character development in the Christie tradition . ",3
"This novel written in the 60s is not in my opinion one of her best . The three stars however is a Christie rating . It is still better than a lot of modern mysteries out there . My main problem was the vagueness at the beginning of the book which led to temporary confusion as to who the third girl actually was . The writer Ariadne Oliver is also a vague character and annoying . Christie does a valiant job trying to reflect the Beatnik era and obviously did her homework on the drugs du jour . Still the overall work lacks coherence . Like Poirot I was well and truly stumped much time is given to the detective 's mental processes . When the ins and outs of the mystery were finally revealed much of it seemed farfetched . I much preferredSleeping Murder a Miss Marple mystery andThey Came to Baghdad . ",2
"It 's not one of her VERY best but it has long been one of my personal favorites because Mrs. Oliver is Poirot 's Hastings & their combination is fascinating . If you want to find out about Mod England of the 1960 's there 's a lot here about that too . Of course there 's the usual convoluted plot and interesting characters . And it was WONDERFUL to read big print & not strain to enjoy a novel ! ! Betty Willard . ",3
"Most of Agath Christie 's works are fast paced and suspenseful . In contrast Third Girl made me want to put it down and count how many pages till the end ! The thing that bored me about Third Girl was how the older characters in it kept saying things like teenagers these days . This book was written in the 60s and that 's when most of Agatha Christie 's worst books were written.The plot was ok but makes you think you have the answer so you might stop reading it in the middle . The ending was really good but the middle kept repeating the same clues over and over.If you are planning to sit down for a couple hours and read a book I guess you could read Third Girl . But if you are busy you wo n't be able to finish it . ",2
"Yet another great mystery from Agatha Christie . I love her work . There is always enough of a plot twits to keep you satisfied but not baffled . ",4
"Third Girl is a late Agatha Christie murder mystery novel being published in 1966 . It would make a fine introduction to Christie and Poirot for someone who has never perused one of Dame Agatha 's many novels.The Plot A young plain girl named Norma Restarick knocks on the door of Hercule Poirot 's quarters one fine morning when the Belgian detective is enjoying a superb breakfast . Norma tells Poirot she believes she has murdered someone but can not remember the heinous act . Norma lives with two other young women in a London flat.These women are named Claudia Reece Hollland and Frances Carey . Claudia is a well organized person who works for Norma 's father who is a wealthy businessman Frances is a socialite who works at an art gallery and pals around with beatniks . Her boyfried is David Baker whose nickname is the Peacock . He has a record of petty crime and dresses like a Regency buck . Norma 's stepmother Mary was almost poisoned to death with weed killer . A middleaged woman in the apartment flat where the three girls live jumps out of a window . Who pushed her out of the window ? A young Doctor named Stillingfleet falls in love with Norma . He seeks to prove her innocent of murder . Poirot is ably assisted in this case by Ariadne Oliver a detective novelist who closely resembles Agatha Christie . The plot deals with drugs forgery false identity and murder . It is an intriguing case showing Agatha Christie could produce a top notch murder mystery into the 1960s.I picked up this novel feeling blue one Saturday morning and read it in one day . It cheered me up as I marveled at the ability of Christie to tell a great story featuring two of my favorite of her characters Poirot and Olvier . Marvelous fun ! ",4
"I 've been a Christie fan since 8th grade and have read them all so many times that I always remember whodunit . Nevertheless I find them a relaxing and enjoyable read when I 'm taking a break from more weighty fiction.This book features two of my favorites Hercules Poirot and Ariadne Oliver . When a young girl comes to see Poirot and confesses she might have committed a murder before running out claiming he was too old to help her Poirot is on the case . As he tracks down the identity of the girl and searches for a death that might fit the bill Mrs. Oliver add bits and pieces of important information that help him solve the case . The final solution is one I never saw coming the first time I read the book at least a very satisfying mystery indeed ! ",4
"Most readers agree that Third Girl is not one of Agatha Christie 's best . Nevertheless it is well worth reading.The plot is clever but with significant flaws the characters good the writing starts out excellent sharp and with Miss Christie 's lighthearted often selfdepreciating humor but about a quarter of the way through the book it gets wordy and what humor remains seems strained.In other Hercule Poirot books we do not get a glimpse of his thought processes until he explains everything in the last chapter . Here we get the opportunity to see him struggling almost dispirited as he tries to make sense of all the information he has received . I admire Miss Christie for her willingness to experiment but I think the result was unfortunate.Do n't concern yourself that Third Girl is not among the most memorable of the Hercule Poirot books . Just read and enjoy ! ",3
"Third Girl is a historical mystery set in 1966 in England though it was a contemporary mystery when it was written . It 's a cluebased puzzle mystery and there were plenty of clues . It was mainly a matter of figuring out how the author was going to put them all together as it could have gone several ways . I accurately guessed several elements of whodunit and why but I had a few things slightly off as well.It felt like less happened in this book than happens in most of Christie 's books . Also some elements of the story were n't fully explained or clearly resolved though the main whodunit was fully explained . So the puzzle was fun but the story was n't as strong as many of Christie 's other novels.There was no bad language . There were no sex scenes . Overall I 'd recommend this book to Christie fans and fans of puzzle mysteries . ",3
"Agatha Christie offers her readers a strange little mystery . A young woman shows up at Hercule Poirot 's door and insists that she thinks that she has committed murder . True to most Christie mystery books the author brings in a half dozen or so of interesting suspects all with their own possible motives and quirks . In this particular plot however Christie spends some time showing Poirot 's own particular way of laying out all the facts in front of him like an imaginary puzzle . He is vexed to no end in his pursuit of the missing patternmissing papers paintings a Peacock a travelhappy father a alcoholic woman who throws herself or is pushed ? from a balcony etc . The everconfident Ariadne Oliver shows up to help out our hero in uncovering the specifics . Georges Poirots ' manservant and Miss Lemon his secretary also show up in this volume of the Poirot series . This mystery is a bit slower than some of the greater and more classic Christie mysteries but having the opportunity to scrutinize the fastidiousness of the Belgian detective 's mind will satisfy most serious Poirot fans . ",3
"Hercule Poirot has just completed his analysis of great writers of detective fiction when he is interrupted by Miss Restarick an unimpressive lass of twenty or so with long straggly hair . The young girl starts by explaining that she might have killed someone but before Poirot can ask more information she says she 's changed her mind and must leave . Before she closes the door she adds You are too old . Nobody told me you were so old I 'm really very sorry . Poirot is intrigued by the girl and enlists Mrs. Oliver 's help in investigating Miss Restarick . The detective duo soon discovers that not only is the girl nowhere to be found but that no one seems to care that she is missing.In his thirtieth appearance in a novel Hercule Poirot is claimed to be too old . But that is surely not what the reader will think of the author 's wit and cleverness . At the age of seventyfive Agatha Christie still succeeds in composing a quite entertaining mystery . Admittedly The Third Girl is not one of her masterpieces but it still has the basic ingredients of a good detective story . The things that have changed more dramatically in comparison to the novels she wrote in the 30 's are the flamboyant characters that make up the story . It is clear that Agatha Christie does not totally agree with the way teenagers are beginning to behave in the sixties . All they seem interested in is sniffing snow swallowing LSD and using hemp . Surely this is an exaggeration in which Agatha Christie reveals slowly losing touch with modern age.Nevertheless Poirot is as absurd and as able as ever which pulls this story out of the pool of mediocrity . And be warned the book starts of with a vital clue so try to avoid reading the denouement while blaming yourself I should have known it ! ",3
"Mrs. Oliver Agatha 's parody of herself joins Poirot in unraveling a murder where none seems to have happened . This is the most action I have seen of Mrs. Oliver . Mr. Goby has a brief appearance too . Overall it is an enjoyable read and exercise for the brain . It kept me guessing to the very end though it is possible to reach the conclusion independently . There is a good amount of repetitiveness in the writing . I also wondered how did certain people get to know certain facts . E.g . Mrs. Oliver learns something . The next day Poirot knows it even though they have n't talked about it to our knowledge . So it 's not a perfect mystery but fun to read nevertheless . ",3
"I 'm currently a bit hooked on classic mysteries blame it on PBS 's 'Mystery ' series and looking through my horde of books I found Agatha Christie 's Third Girl a 1966 work featuring Christie 's famed Hercule Poirot . What is immediately striking is the setting of the novel mod 1966 England an odd place for Poirot who is at least on TV ususally associated with the 1930s and '40s . Also unexpected is Christie 's kind narrative which is an impressive unbiased view of the era 's youth drug culture she speaks of junkiedom as if it were a passing teen fad as serious or frivolous as any other era ' a hangups . In Third Girl a young girl arrives in Poirot 's office and announces she may have committed a murder . She disappears before Poirot can find out anything else regarding her bizarre statement and he spends the bulk of the novel searching for her and deciphering what she meant . Although there are a series of miniwho done its throughout the book the question really is Say what ? I suspect hard core fans of the genre will confidentally figure this mystery out before it 's conclusion but I was over taxed with clues and the resolution and the path leading up to it are a bit hokey and reliant on extremely unlikely coincidences facts and answers seem to fall at our detective 's feet and even though the final answer is like a product in an exquisite math equation it is still a trick question . That 's ok though it 's not so much the mystery which attracts me to the genre particularly Christie 's work it 's her heroes their mannerisms and idiosyncracies their minds their friends their homes and homes away from home like Miss Marple reading Dashiel Hammett over a cup of tea when a gunshot is heard or Hercule Poirot delving into a chocolate layered desert while paging through an art book on French paintings when suddenly it occurs to him who the killer must be and he calls everybody into the room to name the murderer . I like answers in a real world of little resolve . ",3
"Some have considered this the worst Agatha Christie mystery . I would not go anywhere near that far . I did enjoy this story . It has its moments such as Poirot wanting there to have been a murder . The ending completely caught me by surprise but as usual with Christie I felt there were enough clues given so the reader felt he could have figured it out.I will admit I did find the Mrs. Oliver character a bit annoying . I also feel the romance at the end was a bit contrived . Thus I can see why some people are n't thrilled with this book . So I would read some other reviews to help determine if this is the Christie book you need to read next . ",4
"Poirot is grossly overweight in this film . This is not a factor in the plot and does not distract from it but it may disconcert some viewers.A woman arrives in Poirot 's office saying she wants to be saved and may have killed someone . She leaves in a huff declaring that Poirot is too old to help her . Both statements and her behavior are strange they intrigue Poirot and he decides to uncover what is bothering her.He discovers that his friend a female crime novelist calls her the third girl because she is the third female to join two others in renting an apartment . He also learns that an elderly woman was found dead in the apartment building . The police think that she committed suicide but Poirot is convinced that she was murdered . The woman died of a knife wound . The third girl had found her mother when she was a child who had committed suicide on the girl 's birthday . Her mother also died of a knife wound and she inherited a large fortune . Her father who had abandoned her and her mother reappeared from Australia about two years ago . He insists that she is mentally disturbed . One of her roommates agrees.Viewers will want to discover the identity of the dead elderly woman . Who was she ? Why was she killed or committed suicide ? Did the third girl kill her as she believes ? Is the death related in any way to her money ? Is she really insane ? How can Poirot solve the case ? ",4
"To say that this is not Dame Agatha 's best is an understatement . If you are a Christie fan particularly of Ariadne Oliver you 'll probably want to read this one otherwise look elsewhere.The story opens as Poirot has just sent his book to the publishers a young woman arrives seeking his detective services but decides that he is too old . Poirot manages to overcome his shock and elicits a few details from her before she leaves . Then Poirot goes to visit his friend author Ariadne Oliver for sympathy and information . The two sleuths then collaborate to solve the crime.In typical Christie fashion there are long hidden secrets that finally revealed all are not as they seem all clues are fairly laid out for the reader to follow and of course there is a surprise at the end . On the plus side of this otherwise mediocre novel Ariadne Oliver is delightful . ",2

"Norma Restarick sought out Poirot her help and confessedto murder before fleeing . With the help of Mrs. AradianeOliver he seeks her out but she has disappeared . Canhe and Mrs. Oliver find her before it is too late ? One of Dame Agatha 's best . ",4
"THIRD GIRL has an ending that always surprises me andI must have read the book ten times or more the plot if so complex I can only barely remember how it comes out . I feel the book is a greta evocation of Swinging London of the 1960s and that it should have been filmed back then maybe with the following cast Rita Tushingham as poor Norma Restarick Tom Courtenay as Dr. Stillingfleet her psychiatrist who falls in love with her Vanessa Redgrave could have played Frances Cary Terence Stamp could have been David Baker the Peacock.I wonder if Christie ws thinking back to her own early vocal training when she gave NORMA and LOUISE their names because of course they were famous French operas at the time Christie was studying in Paris . Louise was written by Charpentier and that becomes her last name a coincidence no one remarks about in the novel itself.It is a book in which Christie seems to be reviewing her own astonishing career . Mrs. Oliver suggests that she might write a book in which a child commits a murder Not meaning to but just by her father telling her to give her mother a drink made of pounded up box hedge thus neatly conflating the plots of two much earlier novels from the 1950s CROOKED HOUSE and A POCKETFUL OF RYE . I thought also the glamorous fresco painted on the living room wall of the flat where the three girls live a harlequin leaping into space harked back to one of Christie 's famous characters Harley Quin from THE MYSTERIOUS MR. QUIN and may have provoked Christie to think further about Quin because as we know she was soon to return to him after not having written about him for 30 years in THE HARLEQUIN TEA SET . ",4
"Back in the day many years ago reading an Agatha Christie was must reading . After reading John Curran ' a book Agatha Christie 's secret notebooks I decided to revisit Hercule Poirot . So far I have read 30 and the third girl ranks amoung the top 25 . Red herrings mysterya story line that keeps you guessing and of course Hercule with his friend Mrs Oliver she is Agatha Christie 's ulta ego . A missing girl who claims she shot someone or so she thinks and her friends think nothing about not seeing her for days including her family .

"A young woman rudely barges into Hercule Poirot 's residence claiming that she may have murdered someone . Before the Belgian sleuth can gather further information the young lady leaves opining that Poirot is too old to be of any assistance . Disturbed and unsatisfied Poirot tracks down the young lady and finds out first things first what mystery needs solving and then solves it.In many ways this book is very typical of Agatha Christie . The book relies not on action but on gradually presenting the reader with information including a number of blind alleys and red herrings and then providing a rational resolution of the many facts . The setting and peopling of the book is however quite different from many of Christie 's works . Much like Poirot in the book it appears that Ms. Christie is trying to show her readers that older does not mean incapable of accurately observing the world . Ms. Christie drops us in 1960 's London peeking into the world of modern apartment living avant garde art and young folks in general . Indeed I do n't recall meeting a single parson in this book . Third Girl is a fine Agatha Christie deductive mystery with a refreshing change of scenery . ",2
"easy to write reviews on Agatha 's Poirot books they are all excellent . This book is an early premise of the wave of psychologic thrillers with those people with apparent personality disorder . As somebody mentioned before Agatha did it all in her time . ",4
"there is absolutely no possibility that this is her worst book . I dont think she really has onetheyve all been goodbut this is certainly not one of her best . The plot tends to ramble its very slow and at times it can be a bit dull . probably owing to the fact that there really doesnt seem to be mch crime involved at all let alone a death until almost right at the end.But it is still a worthy effortits an original premise its intriguing and the solution is clever and unexpected as we have been led to expect from AC . If you can wade through much of the slightly dull middle section then you will probably be quite glad you read it . Its not her best but its not her worst and there are certainly some enjoyable moments in particular Mrs Olivers following of a suspectMrs Oliver is my favourite of all Christie 's creations . ",2
"Winter had come for Agatha Christie 's writing career and although she was still penning diverting little mysteries in the 1960s it was clear that her best work was behind her . Indeed in this particular novel she has Ariadne Oliver a character based heavily on Christie herself hand in a novel to her publishers which she describes as lousy and frightful which may well have been Christie 's own feelings toward many of her later books.Still Third Girl starts off with an interesting premise . Christie 's famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is relaxing at home when he 's interrupted by the arrival of a young woman who wants to consult him about a murder that she might have committed . Intrigued Poirot agrees to meet with Norma Restarick a girl he describes as an Ophelia devoid of physical attraction . However Norma soon departs without divulging any information dismissing Poirot as too old.Soon enough his friend the mystery writer Ariadne Oliver explains the visitation she met Norma at a party recently and hearing of her strange predicament she encouraged her to go to Poirot for answers . Now that both are hooked on the mystery that surrounds ` the third girl ' named so because of her living conditions with two other girls in a London flat each collaborate on discovering just what she meant when she said that she might have committed a murder.What follows is the accumulation of disparate clues that refuse to form any sort of coherent pattern much to Poirot 's frustration . Eccentric family members vain potential boyfriends closelipped flat mates and old school mistresses make up some of the suspects that surround the case though as Poirot often points out there is no actual murder to investigate . Random events and chance meetings gradually begin to link together as the novel progresses and a pattern emerges from a wig a suspected poisoning a suicide an old man 's memoirs a portrait and of course the third girlPerhaps the main weakness of the story is simply that for a long time we 're not quite sure what the two detectives are trying to solve . An odd comment made by a confused young woman ? It 's not quite as pressing as the discovery of a dead body.Ariadne and Poirot utilize some old tricks in their separate investigations which may bring a smile to the reader 's face and Christie seems to enjoy channeling most of her career frustrations through the character of Ariadne Oliver . The two characters bounce off each other nicely and are still in good form despite their age.However the plot relies on several coincidences such as Ariadne entering a caf & eacute where Norma just happens to be dining and some inconsistencies at first Norma says that she and her father had quality time together before he married his second wife later she says that her father brought her back from South America with him . There are also a couple of plot holes and a minor subplot involving Norma 's great uncle and a secretary who may or may not be a spy that seems rather superfluous . For the titular character Norma is rather devoid of any interesting characteristics . I was never particularly invested in her as a person and we never really get to know her beyond the fact that she hates her father hates her stepmother and hates the world in general . Remind me why I should care ? It becomes increasingly apparent as the narrative goes on that Christie herself is at a loss to understand the sixties culture that surrounded her she only knows that she does n't like it . Poirot and Ariadne express befuddlement and disapproval at every opportunity as to the fashion culture ideals and activities of young people perhaps this disconnect leads to the ineffectiveness of Norma as a sympathetic heroine considering the entire plot seems to run on a disparaging kids these days ! premise.It 's entertaining enough but compared to the rest of Christie 's literary canon it 's certainly mediocre .

"Entertaining tale although a bit slower paced than most Agatha Christie novels . The denouement is a surprise . Worth having for relaxation . ",3
"What was the vain Hercule Poirot to do when a girl insisted on seeing him outside his official hours and upon one look at him blurted out that he was too old and left without accounting for herself ? Especially after she mentioned she might have murdered someone ? Weaving together several subplots from her previous works Agatha Christie tried to create a new setting for her recurrent characters Hercule Poirot and Oliver Ariadne.The Third Girl referred to a term used to advertise for a third female tenant to share the rent of a London apartment . She was also the Orhelia devoid of physical attraction who insulted Hercule Poirot . It was later realised from his indignant outpouring to Oliver Ariadne that she was probably the one who recommended Poirot to this girl.Thus began the mystery that might not have been a mystery . Poirot 's connections to the police did not reveal any possible candidate for the murder mentioned by Norma Restarick youthful daughter to one Andrew Restarick . Andrew Restarick had abandoned his wife and daughter fifteen years before and left for Africa with another woman . The deaths of his wife then his brother brought him back to England with a new wife and took over the family business.Between their visits to Norma 's flat and Restarick office in London and the visit to their home in Crosshedges Long Basing Poirot and Ariadne composed a picture of a family challenged by the revolution of the 60s . Yet there was something beyond the normal angst and as Poirot and Ariadne continued in their pursuit they realised there was a very real danger . There were gossips of guns knives and bloody stains but no murder victim to account for which begged the question whether Norma was guilty innocent or insane.But the questions like what was the danger who was in danger and from whom remained frustratingly vague resisting most attempts of illumination . This is a departure from most detective genres and fans seeking a good old crime would be exasperated at the development of the story.Nonetheless fans of Agatha Christie would be able to garner clues if they had learned how the Queen of Mystery usually placed them subtly.There were two perspectives to the deception as a male I uncovered the male perspective of the deception so easily that I did not realise there was a female perspective deception in place . Certainly it was nothing to complain about for as a reader I received my entertainment of being mystified and surprised . ",2
"This book is actually quite different from most of Ms. Christie 's books . We still get the same great characters and plot and we see Hercule Poirot at the height of his powers but it has a totally surprising ending . It is also a really good snapshot of what the establishment thought of young people during the height of the hippie era . The book starts with a young woman coming to Poirot 's house and interrupting his breakfast . She tells him that she thinks she may have committed a murder and then leaves suddenly without saying anymore . Poirot enlists the help of his friend Ariadne Oliver to try to track down who the girl was and when they find out they find a real mare 's nest of a family . Ms. Christie is such a wonderful author and this book is certainly interesting if different than most of hers . She is still tops in this field and each of her books is entertaining as well as written to get the reader to actually think . ",3
"I 'm a diehard Christie fan and this was just another clever entryin her long list of great novels . My favorite is The Pale Horse . ",4
"I had forgotten that Hercule Poirot was solving crimes way past the betweenthewars golden age of detective fiction . Third Girl is set in swinging London of the midsixties think Twiggy Carnaby Street etc.. The detective and the author are equally bemused by the changes in society . Hercule Poirot was eccentric back in the day but in the 60s with his giant waxed moustache he 's outlandish . When the Third Girl of the title looks up M. Poirot she blurts out You 're too old ! and takes off.Poirot of course prevails with the help of his friend the mystery writer Ariadne Oliver and an extensive Rolodex including people who have more of a grip on modern problems . Still the problems of murder are timeless and I certainly never guessed who done it although I at least picked up some of the clues.If you love a classic murder mystery and want to sample a 60 's period piece you will enjoy Third Girl . ",2
"By the time Third Girl came out in 1966 even the author recognized that her books were not as good as they used to be . Christie 's alter ego the scatty mystery writer Ariadne Oliver plays a large role in Third Girl and in one scene Mrs. Oliver addresses an imaginary publisher about her latest manuscript There you are and I hope you like it ! I do n't . I think it 's lousy ! One can imagine that Christie is addressing her reading public through Mrs. Oliver.Nevertheless even with Christie 's powers on the wane Third Girl is an agreeable read a comfortable book for an afternoon spent on the couch by the fire . It begins with an idea that is most intriguing a young woman comes to Poirot and is not sure if she has committed a murder or not . Of course we all have to wonder how is it possible that she does not know ? There are a few twists and turns and there is also Christie 's take on life in the early sixties which is interesting in itself.Unfortunately Third Girl lacks the crisp writing that can be found in many of Christie 's earlier books . The dialogue rambles and both Poirot and Oliver and even some of the other characters sound like garrulous disapproving old ladies . There may even be some holes in the plot How did Poirot get Restarick 's stationery ? And why had Norma never seen the earlier portrait ? Still Third Girl is a pleasant way to spend the afternoon especially if you 're already familiar with many of her other novels . But I recommend that you do n't begin with this book . ",2

"If you like intricate and complex plots lots of red herrings characters who are not who they say they are murders disguised as suicides and accidents this could be your favorite Christie.At the center of this intruiging book is wealthy Gordon Cloade eldest brother of a family he is devoted to and has promised to always look after . He has amassed a fortune in business and has always maintained that his money also belongs to his family . Although they are also successful the other family members have come to depend on Gordon and the security he and his fortune offer.And now for the fly in the ointment Gordon meets Rosaleen a young Irish widow on an Atlantic crossing and their shipboard romance leads to a quick marriage . Before he can bring her home to his family Gordon is killed during a bombing raid . Because he has not changed his will his entire fortune passes to Rosaleen . She and her brother go to live in his family home and needless to say are the target of much resentment by the family.The alternate title of this book is There Is A Tide and both titles come from the line in Julius Caesar which says There is a tide in the affairs of men when taken at the flood leads on to fortune . Fortune is definitely the key to this novel and the lengths to which men and women will go to obtain one.This is vintage Christie as she proves once more that murder is always exciting when it 's kept all in the family .

Also I have Amazon 's prime shipping which has been a fantastic deal for me . I get a lot of books audiobooks and other Amazon items and prime shipping has paid for itself several times over . ",3

"Always enjoy Christie mysteries this one is another great one to enjoy and it 's irritating to have to have a certain number of words in the review . ",4
"As always Ms.Christie has written an excellent who done it with the Belgum find out the answer to the mystery by using his little grey cells . ",4
"Christie defines the essence of what it means to be a Mystery . She shows the reader how a great Mystery develops clue by clue . The greatest mystery writers inspirewith patient development of the plot . Christie belongs at the top because she has developed along with the genre ",4
"The Cloade family always counted on Gordon Cloade . He was always there to help them out and they confidently expected to inherit his fortune when he died . But when he died in an airraid with a new wife but no new will the family find themselves struggling . Times are tough in postwar Britain . That lovely young widow Rosalind Cloade has everything and maybe she 'd even share it if not for her hostile brother while they have nothing . It does n't seem fair This is a good setup with a lot of intriguing possibilities . Christie takes her usual minimalist approach as characters are introduced situations are described events arise and stories start to unravel . But there 's a blocky feel to the book as people are introduced only to be useful to the plot and then dropped as soon as their usefulness ended . It would have been a stronger book I think if one character POV had been used as often as possible Poirot himself for example or the underused Lynn Marchmont . But the biggest problem with the book is SPOILER ALERTPoirot lets a man who commits manslaughter interferes with a corpse frames someone for murder pays a bribe for perjury and tries to murder his fiancee get away with all that scotfree ! And the fiancee is thrilled by the man 's behaviour ! This is completely out of character for Poirot truly antifeminist and makes a repellent ending to what was otherwise a pretty good book . ",2
"While taking refuge in a London Club during an air raid Poirot tries to take his mind off the bombing going on outside by listening to the club bore tell yet another of his endless stories . Years later the subjects of the story and the bore reenter Poirot 's life as he tries to sort out past fictions from fact to solve more recent murders.The Cloade family had always relied on Uncle Gordon and his money to make their lives more comfortable . In post war England life was most uncomfortable so they needed Uncle Gordon and his money more than ever . Unfortunately for them Uncle has married a much younger woman then died before making provisions for any of them . Now they needed to ask his young wife and her bother or IS he her brother ? for helpor did they ? Surprise twists happen every few pages making what is seemed certain suddenly uncertain rather like the post war turmoil many of the characters were experiencing . In typical Christie fashion though all the clues are there for the reader to ferret out before Poirot reveals all.Please note that this book is also available as THERE IS A TIDE ",4
"Solid lesser known Agatha Christie title has the author 's usual hallmarks namely clean writing and a complicated but clearly described solution to the crime or in this case crimes . Added bonuses are a picturesque setting a small isolated English village and an unpredictable romantic subplot in addition to the unpredictable mystery.Like virtually every Agatha Christie offering Taken at the Flood is a fast engaging reading experience with not an iota of staleness despite its being around for decades . ",3
"You might be able to think you know who done it here but once again Christie makes the obvious deliberately hard to decipher . A really fine plot line contains probably Agatha 's best story involving a will and the many characters fighting over the contents of it . The final twist is a delightful gem . ",3
"This Agatha Christie novel has a deliciously complex plot with the usual twists and turns which are uncovered by the inimitable Hercule Poirot . A young woman named Rosaleen has married a man named Underway . Upon Underway 's death Rosaleen remarries a wealthy man named Gordon Cloade . He dies two weeks after the marriage which makes Rosaleen a very wealthy widow indeed . She and her brother come to take over Cloade 's home and fortune much to the dismay of Cloade 's family who have lost a fortune to her . Soon a man comes to town and claims that Rosaleen 's first husband Underway is not dead meaning Rosaleen is still married to him and so should not inherit Cloade 's fortune . People begin to die and one of the Cloade men asks for Hercule Poirot 's help in solving the mystery . Poirot interviews the people involved gets his little gray cells working and puts together the puzzle to solve the murders . This is another wonderful book by the world 's most famous mystery author . ",3
"TAKEN AT THE FLOOD is one of the last and almost the best of Christie 's run of psychological novels that she wrote during the 1940s including SAD CYPRESS SPARKLING CYANIDE FIVE LITTLE PIGS THE HOLLOW and TOWARDS ZERO . In them you can see her making conscious effort to give her characters greater depth and emotional complexity and in general these books though not as fun perhaps as her earlier triumphs repay the reader 's attention with a rich array of situations in which life as it is actually lived rises to meet us as we go through each book.FLOOD concerns the plight of one cosseted middleclass family the Cloades who are faced with a moral and financial emergency when their leader wealthy old Gordon Cloade perishes in a German sir raid in London during WWII and leaves his money to a gorgeous young Irish girl whom none of them have ever met . Rosaleen is sweet and simpleminded but her brother nasty piece of work David Hunter makes life miserable for the suddenly poor Cloade family.Christie lets us see Rosaleen Cloade in all her dimensionsher beauty her innocence and coupled with those her guilt and despair . In the opposite corner stands her opposite number Lynn Marchmont a country girl who 's been overseas in the military and when she comes back home to her farmer fiance suddenly finds him very humdrum and David Hunter dangerously attractive . But it 's not just the women that Christie writes wellDavid Hunter is as dashing a rogue as Tom Jones and Rowley Cloade the man Lynn left behind when war broke out is also appealingly characterized . The plot is complicated but when Poirot sorts it out as dazzlingly simple as anything Christie ever concocted all resting on one sinple trick of misdirection . The point is it would n't even need the murder angle to succeed at being a firstrate story of passion and denial upper class privilege and servant class resentment . But I have to say every time I read it I fall for the same tricks over and over again . What is Lynn 's choice ? What does her choice of men say about her ? ",4
"Like many murder mysteries this one revolves around money . You see the Cloade family was promised by their bachelor uncle that they would inherit his wealth when he dies seeing as that he has no heirs himself . Imagine their disappointment when he suddenly marries a young woman and then goes and gets himself killed in a German airraid . Now the young bride inherits all the moneythe money that the Cloades sorely need . 'Taken at the Flood ' was not one of Christie 's best although it is enjoyable enough for a quick afternoon read . Red herrings are piled right and left to confuse the reader as per usual . And if you can spot the major clue which Christie practically signposted on page..well all I 'm saying is that if you can spot it then you 'll probably have a good hunch who did the dirty deed.Or would you ? For the case IS puzzling as more bodies begin to pile up three people die in the book . Poirot himself is confused and asks If A has a motive to kill C and B has a motive to kill D would it make sense if A killed D and B killed C ? Perfect book for that 23 hour plane train or car ride .

"There is a Tide also sold as Taken at the Flood is a Hercule Poirot novel . It 's a pretty typical I mean that in a good way Christie book following the devious plots of the Cloade family and interested parties.While in a club to escape an air raid in World War II Hercule Poirot overhears a story claiming that a man Robert Underhay who has been reported dead was actually intending to fake his own death and live a new life as Enoch Arden . He files it away in his brain as being interesting and years later . something actually comes of it . Robert Underhay 's young widow Rosaleen has married Gordon Cloade who is an incredibly rich man . Unfortunately he is also soon dead killed in an air raid . The Cloade family has been dependent on Cloade 's money with his encouragement and now all of it goes to Rosaleen . Things are complicated by a man named Enoch Arden turning up at the Cloades ' home village Warmsley Vale.This book has a million twists and turns most of which I did n't see coming . I read somewhere that Agatha Christie often pulls up new evidence that explains everything at the end I have never found this to be the case . Every time a new revelation was made I realised that I should have connected the dots but of course my little grey cells are not Poirot 's . Each clue is definitely foreshadowed . There are also plenty of red herrings motives for murder false alibis everything that makes a Christie novel fun . I also enjoyed the look at postWorld War II British hardships . Definitely recommended . ",3
"Newly demobilized from the WRNS Women 's Royal Naval Service after World War 2 Lynn Marchmont is appalled to find what time has done to her family . After having married a young woman named Rosaleen her rich uncle is killed by a German bomb leaving the family cut off from the funds that they had grown accustomed to using . Now the family hates Rosaleen and her brother David Hunter and David very much hates them . And when a man shows up claiming that Rosaleen longlost first husband is actually alive and well it seems to be the answer to the family 's prayers . But when people start dying the whole situation turns terribly tangled . There is only one man who can untangle this mystery and that is the great Belgian detective Hercule Poirot ! This is another excellent mystery of just the caliber that you no doubt expect from Agatha Christie . The mystery is nice and twisted making it totally unclear as to whom the real culprit is and what is truly going on . I really enjoyed the mystery and the characters David Hunter Lynn Marchmont and the whole Cloade clan . This is a great mystery one that I highly recommend ! ",4
"Quite good . Entertaining . Solid Agatha and that 's saying something . ",3

"Set just after the end of WWII Taken at the Flood centers on the Cloade family . In 1946 Hercule Poirot overhears a curious story about the Cloades told by the notoriously boring old windbag of his London club . Then two years later a member of the Cloade family comes to his house a scatty middleaged woman into automatic handwriting and ouija boards who said she was spirit led and who tried to persuade Poirot to find a supposedly dead person that she believes is alive . But it is n't until a few weeks later when actual murder takes place that Poirot obeys the summons of his police officer friend and travels to the village where the Cloades live . There he finds a tangle of loyalties and motives and two more people are dead before the mystery is solved.As Agatha Christie mysteries go this one is definitely mediocre in spite of Hugh Fraser 's excellent narration . It will appeal to avid Agatha Christie fans but probably no one else . ",2
"Demobilized W.R.N . Lynn Marchmont returns to her home village Warmsley Vale . Lynn has been much changed by World War II somewhat missing the adrenaline of the war and she returns to a muchchanged prospects for the future . Her millionaire uncle Gordon Cloade died in London during the Blitz shortly after marrying a 25yearold Irish widow the erstwhile Rosaleen Underhay . At her irascible brother 's direction the new Mrs. Cloade begins to cut off the many Cloade relatives who were long encouraged to rely on generous Uncle Gordon the perfect invitation to murder in an Agatha Christie novel.But death instead comes to a newly arrived stranger Enoch Arden . He had attempted to blackmail Rosaleen 's resentful and controlling brother David Hunter claiming that Rosaleen 's first husband is n't dead at all making Rosaleen 's second marriage and her claim to the Cloade fortune invalid . Such an eventuality would have saved the many Cloade relations who find themselves in dire financial circumstances . Needless to say it would have sent Rosaleen and David packing without a penny . The police immediately finger David as Chief Suspect No . 1.Initially sympathetic Lynn becomes quite the whiner when she begins to have feelings for the loathsome David Hunter . About onefourth of the way through the book I really did start losing patience with her . The novel 's denouement shows her up to be a silly senseless girl although I have to admit that I never imagined who the murderer was in Taken at the Flood 's twist ending . And like all of Christie 's books where Poirot does n't take center stage until late the novel suffers for his absence.Taken at the Flood is worth reading it 's still Dame Agatha 's after all but it 's certainly noThe Murder of Roger AckroydorThe Body in the Library A Miss Marple Mystery Miss Marple Mysteries .

"Prospective buyers will first note that this one like many Christie books has been released under two different titles There Is a Tide and Taken at the Flood which is always very confusing for folks who are trying to acquire all the Agatha Christie books . Here I 'm reviewing the 1984 Berkley paperback which is the one I own . The work was originally published in 1948.The Cloades are a quiet family aunts uncles nieces and nephews including a doctor a lawyer and a farmer . They all reside in their cocoon of a sleepy English hamlet dubbed Warmsley Vale but their financial stability and all their futures are rendered to a shambles when the generous family millionaire Gordon Cloade dies suddenly during a German bombing of London just after he had taken a youthful Irish bride Rosaleen and after having additionally neglected to write out a new will to meet his numerous pecuniary promises to his blood relations.Rosaleen and her disruptive and controlling brother settle in at the Warmsley Vale mansion alongside the numerous remaining Cloades who have every reason to wish the new Mrs. Gordon Cloade dead so that the estate would return to them under English law . Rosaleen 's brother David enjoys the good life until an ominous man appears at the local inn and who may be Rosaleen 's supposedly dead first husband . And so here we have all the stereotypical ingredients for murder most foul ! Murders do subsequently occur no surprise there ! and the world 's greatest detective Mr. Hercule Poirot involves himself in resolving the mystery . I actually think that Doyle 's Sherlock Holmes and Upfield 's Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte were both better but this is the lofty title which Poirot confers upon himself.Of her 80 or so books and I 've read them all most multiple times this is one of Christie 's best efforts . It has layers of atmosphere colorful characters and neverending surprises . And while I think that her best work was her first oneThe Mysterious Affair at Styles this one is still very strong amongst all the mysteries ever written by anyone.It 's 231 pages in paperback and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have .

"Sadly not quite famous like others this is one of the best . Agatha Christie wrote good novels bad novels and great novels . The great ones are wherever she told a beautiful story with beautiful characters together with a good mystery clues twists and atmosphere . This is one of the great . ",4
"Taken at the Flood or as it was published originally in the United Sates There is a Tide features Hercule Poirot trying to solve a mysterious murder that would have benefitted many people . With so many possible motives the clues are a massive tangle and only Poirot 's inimitable grey cells can organize them . Taken at the Flood is a fastpaced thrilling whodunit that will leave readers guessing to the very end.Old Gordon Cloade 's family had much to gain from his death . He had long made it know that upon his death his family members would benefit from his great wealth so that they did not have to worry about money during his lifetime he would always help them out . Yet no one was prepared for Gordon 's marriage to a young woman nor his subsequent death during an air raid in London a death that left all his money to his widow and her money hungry brother . Therefore perhaps with just cause the Cloades detest this new bride seeing her as a barrier to their gaining their rightful inheritance . So when a stranger appears in the town of Warmsley Vale with the news that the widowed Mrs. Cloade may have a first husband who is still alive the family jumps at the chance that the money might be theirs . When the stranger is found murdered the immediate suspect is Rosaleen 's brother David a mysterious man whom many assume may not be her actual brother . Yet Rosalenn claims she has never seen the dead man before and the star witness that testifies to the opposite is found dead from suicide . Poirot knows something strange is afoot and tries his hardest to protect Rosaleen from the greedy Cloade family members who have a wealth of problems embezzlement drug addiction but a dearth of money to help themselves out . Who really benefitted from the stranger 's death and did he really need to die ? From the getgo nothing about the case arranges itself neatly in Poirot 's mind . He feels that the victim and the method are all wrong . Readers get to join him for the ride to uncover the truth of the matter . Is David who he says he is ? Would certain members of the Cloade family murder to get their hands on Gordon 's money ? These are all questions Poirot must solve before too many others lose their life . Taken at the Flood is an intriguing mystery with just as many twists as one would expect from a Christie work . After such an incredible buildup and amount of clues the ending seems rather rushed and almost unsatisfactory . However the ride is worth it to uncover the real truth to these muddled mess . ",3
"Taken at the Flood is a novel of money and selfentitlement . When a rich man dies unexpectedly in an air raid all his money falls into the hand of his new bride and her domineering brother . To the family who have come to rely on his wealth this comes as a terrible blow . When plots to regain the money lead to tragedy legendary detective Hercule Poirot is called upon to untangle passion from coldblooded calculation.Maybe it 's because I read too much Christie but the core revelation was staring me in the face from the beginning so I was not entirely surprised by the ending . But whereas the mystery aspect was unsatisfying I did enjoy the psychology of the book especially the quiet desperation of the family . I usually enjoy Christie 's romantic subplots but this one left a sour taste in my mouth . Still I enjoyed this story on the whole . ",2
"During the WWII Hercule Poirot sits out an air raid in a London Club trying to distract his nerves from the bombing by listening to the waffling story of a club member who recounts the marriage of his friend Robert Underhay and the young Rosaleen Hunter . A strange sort of fellow his old friend considers out loud the possibility of Underhay faking his own death in order to free Rosaleen from her lessthanhappy marriage . It is not until several years after this little anecdote that the story will reemerge in Poirot 's life in surprising circumstances.Gordon Cloade has always promised his assorted brothers inlaws nephews and nieces that they would be well looked after during their lifetimes both before and after his death . However after an impulsive marriage to a much younger woman Cloade is killed in an air raid before getting the chance to alter his will in order to continue his financial support of the rest of the family . Without a new will his entire fortune is automatically inherited by his new wife Rosaleen and by proxy her brother David . Needless to say the rest of the family is not impressed.The title of the novel is taken from Shakespeare 's Julius Caesar There is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune and it is certainly this inexorable pull toward fortune that makes up the primary motivation of the suspects in the novel . The Cloades dearly need the money but although Rosaleen is something of a pushover her brother David is certainly not about to give up his newfound fortune and in the meantime is finding the uncomfortable situation of the family rather amusing.In the middle of all this is young Lynn Marchmont a demobilized Wren who is engaged to Rawley Cloade but has her head turned by David . Bored with the return to her humdrum life and caught in the usual all girls want bad boys mindset Lynn watches the mystery unfold with interest as Hercule Poirot arrives on the scene and begins to investigate the murder of the man known only as ` Enoch Arden ' who seems to have contacted certain family members with pertinent information regarding Cloade 's legacy and Rosaleen 's marital statusWhat unfolds is one of Christie 's most sophisticated and complex plots one that includes blackmail mistaken identity family secrets conspiracies lies and murder most foul . Although this is certainly a strong story it does have somewhat weaker characterization the suspects are thinly drawn stereotypes and even Poirot himself feels somewhat subdued this time around . As for Lynn Marchmontwell by the end of the story I was wondering if perhaps she has some sort of mental disorder considering her taste in men . You 'll know what I mean when you read the final pages and no I have n't given anything away.Christie seldom made commentaries on the war and yet here takes the chance to explore some of the problems of social and financial reconstruction during the war such as young people returning from the war and finding life too dull in comparison the rising postwar taxes that sapped away most family 's nest eggs and the resentment of those who were left behind to tend to the land whilst others took up the fighting . It creates an interesting little window on the past and those that lived through these particular years.All in all this is one of my favourite Christie mysteries a swift pace an intriguing setup and yet another of her twist endings that caught me complete offguard .

"This is one of the most original mystery of all times . Agatha Christie treated the readers to not one not two but three deaths each death being a very clever deception ! The final outcome is almost guaranteed to please all mystery fans . The fourth deception is the title which I personally thought seriously failed to convey anything meaningful to the contents.During an air raid in London World War 2 Poirot happened to overhear a Major Porter musing over a news report he just read . Mr Gordon Cloade rich old man and once thought to be a confirmed bachelor had married a young girl Rosaleen shortly before being hit by enemy bombing of London . The widow and her brother were the only people succesfully rescued the rest of the household staff perished and Gordon Cloade did not awaken though the rescuers dug him out too.Major Porter mused that he had known the first husband of Rosaleen in Africa a colonial by the name of Robert Underhay . The couple realised that the marriage was a mistake . Pious Roman Catholic Underhay confided in Porter that he might do an Enoch Arden in reference to Alfred Tennyson 's poem of the same name letting the world think he was dead and enabling Rosaleen to move on with her life . Whatever the case word came to the colonial office that Underhay died in the outbacks and later Rosaleen had a lightning marriage with rich Gordon Cloade only to be widowed again shortly.The story moved on to a year after the end of the war and life in Britain was difficult for most people not the least to other members of the Cloade family . Gordon Cloade was the financial protector who had actively encouraged the other Cloades to venture out on their own tacitly promising financial backings to pick them up if they fall or to take care of them . The quick succession of his marriage and death meant that all his money went into a trust for his widow instead . Though the Cloades were not parasitic one by one they ran into difficulties in postwar Britain ranging from a housewife whose prewar investments shrank to a farmer struggling to make his farm viable even those in the medical and legal profession had financial problems . They might have come to terms with the apparently simpleminded Rosaleen but for her outrightly hostile brother David Hunter.Things became very interesting when a man arrived in their village claiming to be Enoch Arden . An inn 's maid overheard David Hunter being blackmailed with news of Underhay still being alive . Shortly afterwards Enoch Arden was found murdered.Agatha Christie normally provided readers with one strong highly involved enigmatic girl who was either instrumental in the plot or in providing insights such as Elinor Carlisle in Sad Cypress Joanna Burton in The Moving Finger and Veronica Cray in The Hollow . It was a rare treat in this novel that she had two such female characters Frances Cloade wife of Jeremy Cloade the lawyer who was determined to save her husband at all cost and show him that she loved him and had not married because he saved her father before and Lynn Marchmont a discharged WREN trying to decide if she still wanted to marry Rowland Cloade the farmer who stayed behind during the war to farm the land or it was a different person she wanted.Agatha Christie 's female characters were always more interesting than her males their insight sheer determination and tenacity would quickly dispel the myth of women being the weaker sex.In a true Christie style readers were given a glimpse that each of branch of the Cloade family had something to hide . In a novel twist none apparently is what could usually be guessed.This book ranks with one of Christie 's mustread along with Death on the Nile and Murder On The Orient Express . ",4
"Agatha Christie is such a master at her chosen genre that mystery novels are continually judged against her extensive body of work . And well they should be . She keeps her readers guessing right up until the end over and over again . She is still truly the Grande Dame of mystey fiction writers and her work will be around for a long time to come . In this book we have Hercule Poirot visiting a small village called Warmsley Vale . He finds himself in a real tangled mess that concerns various members of a certain family that lives in this outoftheway spot . The ending is a real surprise and we the readers have such fun getting there . No one can match Ms. Christie 's cunning and ingenious plots and this book does not disappoint . ",3
"Her last book this enjoyable mystery revolves around a presentation of Macbeth mostly called the play by the superstitious cast who feel there is a curse of sorts attached to any presentation of this work of the Bard . Fascinating characters notably a weapons master Gaston Sears who not only insists on manufacturing a bona fide claymore he uses the technically accurate term claidheamhmor for the deadly twohanded blade for use he also choreographs the fight scene . As the director Peregrine seeks to quell any superstitious nonsense a series of pranks occur dummy head showing up in odd places as well as a decapitated rat the play starts off without a hitch . Sadly this does not remain the case and Inspectors Alleyn and Fox must show up later when the dummy head of Macbeth on the claymore turns out to be the REAL head of Dougal Macdougal who was playing the part . Added to the intrigue is that fact that the criminally insane father of the young actor William actually had beheaded the wife of one of the other actors and was committed to an asylum for life.The case is finally solved as a result of the young playmates of William 's selection of toy soldiers to act out the parts helping Alleyn to identify who did and how it was done . You 'll have to read this wellcrafted story to find out but I can tell you this BEWARE THE POWER OF THE CLAIDHEAMHMOR ! ",4

"Dame Ngaio Marsh is remembered as the author of 32 classic detective novels featuring Chief Inspector Roderick Alleyn . She was known as one of the four Queens of Crime for her monumental contribution to crime fiction in the 1920s and '30s . Crime novels were her bread and butter but her true love was the theater after spending her early years as an actress she had a huge influence in the development of professional theater in her native New Zealand . Shakespearean productions were her passion.Light Thickenswas her final novel published in the year of her death 1982 . It has all the hallmarks of the genre while depending for much of its interest on its miseenscene a production of Macbeth at the Dolphin Theater in London . The book opens in the Dolphin where owner Peregrine Jay is assembling his cast for the first meeting . The scene works well in the introduction of the characters and Jay 's vision for the production.Marsh 's books generally involve a lot of story before the crime manifests itself and this one is no exception . The old superstitions about the play 's unluckiness weave through the first half of the book as the rehearsals take shape . Stagecraft details are authoritative and fascinating the costumes are suggestive of clan tartan the witches are played for maximum evil the closely choreographed sword fights are rehearsed with huge Scottish claymores to the pounding beat of Verdi 's Anvil Chorus.Since this IS after all a detective novel it wo n't spoil your fun if I tell you that there are accidents involving fake dripping heads culminating in a REAL dripping head on a pike on opening night . Enter Chief Inspector Roderick Alleyn . Investigation . Resolution . Curtain.There are better detective books by Dame Ngaio Marsh my own favorite isClutch of Constables Roderick Alleyn Mysteries . None does a better job though of blending the two fields in which her skill was unquestioned theater and the crime novel . That 's the element that endearsLight Thickensto so many readers . A passing knowledge of the Scottish Play may add to your enjoyment but if you do n't know it you can get what you need from Peregrine Jay 's production notes . As to the superstition you 'll have to decide for yourself whether you dare to speak the name MACBETH.Linda Bulger 2008 ",3
"Marsh mysteries frequently involve murders associated with the arts esp . the theater . This one 's about an enactment of Macbeth . She also tends to insert something of her native New Zealand and indeed there is an interesting Maori in the play . The majority of this book her last one describes the production of the play . I think your reaction to the book will reflect your interest in the details presented prior to the murder . The characters as well as the description of the intracacies of theater were IMHO quite interesting and colorful . Of course Chief Superintendent Alleyn just happens to be in the audience when the murder is committednot for the 1st time either ! The mystery is not particularly satisfying and can I believe be solved by the reader with relative ease but the involvement of the children adds some interest to its unraveling . To the mystery purist this book may not satisfy however . But considering Marsh 's matured writing style it 's an easy read and IMHO a fun book due to its dramatic descriptions . ",3
"I enjoyed this Ngaio Marsh 18951982 entry a great deal albeit it 's not representative of her very best works such asFalse Scent Roderick Alleyn Mysteries which is yet another theatrical murder mystery also featuring Scotland Yard 's Inspector Roderick Alleyn.Marsh a New Zealander was herself a director of theater so in this instance she naturally established an extensive wallpaper of details before she got around to knocking off her victim . I did n't mind this at all since her background for the mystery was so competently conveyed.The story is essentially that Theater Director Peregrine Jay is putting on a topnotch production of Macbeth a play which reputedly brings bad luck to its principals . An apparent Herculean swing by some unknown cast or crew member 's huge sword a Claymore which has a difficult Scottish pronunciation and which is additionally said to have powers of its own ! brings the impending fear of doom to a head . And even though Inspector Alleyn was in the audience watching the play when the murder occurred he still has a tough time sorting this one out.I think that it would probably have been nice to have had just a little more of Inspector Alleyn and slightly less of the theater director but it is what it is . I highly recommend this one for any enthusiast of Ngaio Marsh or for British cozy murder mystery fans in general . ",3
"Light Thickens is Ngaio Marsh 's last novel and one of her best . The mystery centers around a production of Macbeth at the Dolphin Theatre in London . Most of those involved in the play are superstitious to varying degrees about the badluck curse traditionally associated with Macbeth . Even to say the play 's name is considered dangerous so it 's referred to as the Scots play . During rehearsals someone starts playing gruesome practical jokes . And somebody is sending out anonymous messages about a likable and talented child actor whose father is the Hampstead Chopper a notorious serial killer confined in the Broadmoor asylum . One night during a performance attended by Chief Superintendent Roderick Alleyn a grisly murder involving a ceremonial sword occurs just before the final curtain . If you like traditional British cozies with mostly pleasant characters you 'll probably enjoy this mystery and if you 're also a Shakespeare aficionado you 'll enjoy it even more . ",4

"I purchased this book based on the 31 5 star reviews . After a trip to Thailand I wanted to learn to cook the food . I am disappointed . The format is TOO BIG 10x14to be practical as a cookbook . Also the recipes are short on techniquesjust the ingredients and basic cooking instructions . I 'm donating this book to Goodwill and purchasing a real Thai cookbook . ",0
"I think the only serious competition for this book isThai Food and I would cautiously award the blue ribbon to this book if only because it contains lots and lots of recipes that I have actually seen and tasted whileThai Foodseems to have a lot of recipes like Beef and Mangosteen Soup which I have never heard of much less tasted . I suspect that a lot of this may be Royal Thai Cuisine which is undoubtedly delicious but rather requires a kitchen full of servants . ! This book on the other hand shows you how to cook such everyday items as Pork Fried Rice and their version looks GREAT plus dozens of other items . In fact if you know of a Thai dish and can not find it in this book that will be a big exception.Full marks for the lovely photographs as well ! Just leafing through this wonderful book will make you hungry . ",4
"Have n't tried any of the numerous recipes but the book is indeed beautiful . Got it because other reviewers mentioned that the recipes were relatively authentic . I 'm optimistically expecting to find most or all of the ingredients tamarind leaves ? ! here in the San Francisco bay area . ",3
"This has to be one of the most beautiful cookbooks I have ever seen . Very well suited for a coffee table book . It 's recipes are organized by region . Fantastic color photography . You will be very happy with this if you like Thai cooking or are looking for a gift for someone who is . ",4
"I have other great Thai cookbooks but they do n't havethe beautiful photos of what the food should look like asthis book does . ",4
"I bought this cookbook for my husband for christmas and he has tried several recipes so far which we absolutely love ! The art and photography found in this book was beautiful and we enjoyed reading about the history of Thailand . This cookbook provides a nice background of the country which makes the recipes special and unique . These recipes are full of flavors that most people are n't accustomed to but are delicious and refreshing ! ",4
"I have lived in Thailand and this book is the best cookbook I have found in the US . It made me very happy to be able to see Thai foods that are not offered in Thai restaurants in the US and not seen in other Thai cookbooks . Now I can finally have my Nam Gabi and Soup No Mai . The spelling is different in the book . I was happy to see both the Roman lettering and the true Thai word for the dish . It helps me figure out what the dish is and jogs my memory when reading the Thai . Thai food is great and I 'm happy to see the recipes and the Thai regional information included . ",4
"so my new rescue dog chewed up about 15 cookbooks while I was at work . This one is a favorite and I do use it quite a bit . Although the chewed up book was useable I wanted a new one so this is the replacement . This book has beautiful pictures and a good history of Thailand . It includes recipes for the curry paste and other condiments as well . ",4
"This is an outstanding cookbook and a must for any avid Thai cook . My wife is Thai and when she saw this book she was shocked to see some recipes that she have not seen and had since she was in Thailand many moons ago . I was very impressed and very delighted with this book and I strongly recommend it . The recipes if carried out to the letter are authentic and worth trying.That said . The book is too large and bulky to carry with you to the kitchen while you are preparing dishes . Additionally the pages are glossy and for sure you do n't want set it on the kitchen counter . In order to preserve the book condition it is best that you write down the recipe on paper . I am not deducting any points because of this incovenience though I wish to take off a quarter point for that.Overall I am very pleased . ",4
"A large format Thai cookbook with amazing photos and wonderful recipes . I was able to recognize all my favorites as well as find some new ones to try . You really wo n't go wrong with this book . Would make a great gift for someone or for yourself . ",4
"I thoroughly enjoyed Sahara . It was the first Clive Cussler novel I have read and I 'm certainly coming back for more . The reason I liked it is because of it 's fullblown action how it is very hard to put down and how it has a suave yet clever hero Dirk Pitt . It was interesting to me how Cussler could tie together those three events President Lincoln assasination a pilot that dissapeared over the desert and a deadly amount of red tide that could threaten the world 's oxygen supply that gave me more respect for the story . And though it was not or does not carry much of a message I would reccomend it to actionloving readers who enjoy a grand adventure and story like I do . ",3
"The audio cassette of Sahara was so bad in my opinion that it does not deserve a review from someone of my caliber.My wife and I put it in the car when we went on an overnighter to get away from the kids a week or so ago . We listened to it for about 20 minutes into the drive and then shut it off it was so lame.I finished it a while later on my commute to and from work . After having finished it all I can say is that I am glad I do not have to listen to Tom Wompat try and sound like the sexy Eva Rojas anymore it was almost nauseating.This is my second Clive Cussler book in the last month and I have to say he is not as good as I remember him . I remember really liking Treasure quite a few years ago when I was still a kid.I have now listened to Sahara and have read Shock Wave in the last month and both have been so unbelievable that they were actually funny at times . ",0
"What a premise and terrific subplots ! OK OKso it is a bit farfetched but that is what good fiction does it stretched the imagination to possible whatifs and if onlys ' . Lots of the usual twists and turns but again Cussler has given us an involved tale with characters we can visualize and a locale that always evokes possibilities . Cussler is a terrific storyteller and I like to think I have helped pay for his car collectionwell maybe a few gallons of car wax ! If you are looking for a book that makes a great beach read or one of those books to cuddle up with on a cold night this is the book out of his many works . Enjoy ! ",3
"Cussler is never better in his storytelling than when he incorporates an historical event into his novels and at the beginning of 'Sahara ' we are smack in the middle of the Civil War . At first you may wonder what it has to do with Dirk Pitt and events in Africa but do n't worryClive has a rabbit up his sleeve and when he produces the surprise it 'll give you goosebumps ! 'Sahara ' has one of Pitt 's most nasty adversaries but then again are n't they ALL bad ? ? and has more action per page than any other adventure novel available today . Action after suspense after thrillsthis novel literally has it all . The deadly plague infesting the ocean certainly sounds catastrophic but with Dirk and Al on the case one thing is for sure a good time will be had by anyone who cracks the pages of this fine actionadventurethriller . There are a few gaping holes of reality herewe all know that Clive takes certain liberties but for all the action and excitement we cut him some slack . You will see Cussler at the top of his form in a story as exciting and fun as anything else in his amazing list of accomplishments . A darn good read . ",3
"Clive does the leg work to keep you into his books and I just ca n't get enough of them Seems he just loves to keep you thiunking ",4
"OK I have read EVERY Dirk Pitt novel Clive Cussler has written so I definitely qualify to review his books . I enjoy how Cussler pushes the technological envelope in each new story even a little over the top I also enjoy how Dirk Pitt is the ruthless hero only to baddies not to beautiful women we 've all wished our movie action heroes could be . If you 've read more than one Dirk Pitt novel you know what I 'm talking about . No need to elaborate so as not to ruin it for others less fortunate.By the way I appreciate how he writes himself into nearly every novel . Do n't criticize you 'd do it too if you knew how to make a living writing.I enjoyed Sahara immensely . Cussler has a way of getting you to say Hmmmcould that be what really happened ? I usually leave a LOT of room for authors to play with the rules of technology and even the laws of physics now and then.However despite Cussler 's quality I ca n't ignore this oneIf you are dehydrated to the point of death no wait even if you are dehydrated significantly less than to the point of death you do n't simply drink quarts and quarts of water and in a matter of minutes fully recover shake the dust off and sally forth on your merry way . Even somewhat dehydrated you will be on a table with an IV in your arm for several hours . I know this firsthand . Technology is one thing medical accuracy is another.NonethelessA very good book typical Cussler . ",3
"From two unlikely historical prologues which seem to be unrelated through Egypt and a red tide of death . . .Dirk Pitt and friends are back once again ! This is a book that I would recommend to any thriller fan be they a diehard Cussler fan like myself or totally unfamiliar . Prepare for impact as Dirk and co. combat a ruthless French industrialist who has done a total jerrybuilt job of a toxic waste disposal plant in the Malian Sahara and is using people presumed dead as slaves in a mine which makes the Unit 731 WW2 experiments look like a pinprick ! How Dirk and Al manage to be in the right place at the right time and meet their creator in an amusing cameo role . . . I don ` t know ! The best is yet to come but I won ` t give away the ending which does get you thinking . Overall one which is impossible to put down ! Another classic Cussler treat and one of his best . Lunacy action great ` set pieces ` and ` imaginative effects ` this would make a superb movie actually ! ",4
"I had a lot of fun reading Sahara.A little far fetched but that'sd Dirk Pitt.I would recommend this book . ",4
"Okay so I 'm not a Cussler fan and read the book on a dare . This book is laughable . The writing is inept the plot facile . The dialog is unintentionally hilarious . It is a mystery to me why so many people read Cussler . Hey I 'm no literary snob but even for escapist literature Sahara is just dreadful . After I read this book I was inspired to host a Clive Cussler writing contest . Needless to say the entrants were better than the inspiration ! ",0
"I wanted to try out another adventure writer other than the ones I 've been reading . I thought I 'd give Clive Cussler a try since I read Raise The Titanic.The setups in the beginning were longwinded and gave absolutely no relation to the story whatsoever till somewhere towards the end of the book . It served to confuse the readers greatly until strangely and coincidentally enough the Dirk Pitt chances upon them.The book is full of male bravado and machoism . It was shameless in the way Clive included himself into the novel as one of the characters searching for the lost ship . At the same time the people who seem not to die or get injured miraculously is Dirk Pitt . Everyone else he knows dies.The plot itself was very round about back and forth and linear . I hope the movie would prove a better watch . Otherwise some interesting facts about survival in the Sahara that 's about it . ",1
"Another Dirk Pitt adventure which entertains and astounds the reader . I saw the movie first and was disappointed to see the departure from the story after reading the book . I was looking forward to the literary description of events in the movie to find they were not there . But as they say the book is better than the movie and it is true for Sahara . I have read every book in order to this point and have not been let down yet . Thankfully Cussler has not fallen into the Clancy trap of repeating storylines with minor adjustments . Hopefully it continues . ",3
"This book in the Dirk Pitt series is probably the most actionpacked full of adrenaline and gunblazing frenzy ! Instantly addicting . And it has probably become the most talkedabout with the movie being just around the corner . Check it out before the movie is released ! It 'll make you thirsty for more ! ",4
"I . INTERESTING There is some history in this book . How can you tie in the civil war aviation history deadly epidemics and present day Saharan Africa ? Clive Cussler does it and I found it very interesting . By no means is this a historical novel and the drive of the story is adventure not history . But I appreciated the research that the author did to enhance the story . Apparently the author has led an exciting life deeply rooted in history and he puts his experience in and passion for history in this story.II . LONG The book is long . Some books are long because of the number of pages . But this book is long for other reasons . I quickly grew tired of the story and stories like these are often very predictable . The story is long as well because of the female character . Her relationship with Dirk Pitt is as believable as the ridiculous story line.III . ACTION FILLED This book is packed with action . Sometimes the action is clever other times it is disappointingly foreseeable . The story is not plotdriven it is not characterdriven the story is clearly driven by the action.IV . CORNY While reading this book I could n't help but remember by childhood days reading the Hardy Boys . Every Hardy Boys story had the same exact story line with just different circumstances people and places . This book followed the same easy to predict story line . Adding to the corniness is the implausibility of the story Dirk defies the odds about 12 too many times . This is the sacrifice the author has to make in order to have fun fast adventure.I do n't regret reading Sahara but I probably will not read another Cussler book again . Following the book the 2005 movie is heavy in action but light in plot . ",2
"My Grandad got me into Cussler . I 'd eagerly wait for him to finish the latest installment so I could then read it.Now I can buy my own copy and with Sahara Cussler is as brilliant as ever . Dirk foils a plot to wipe out all sea life rescues the beautiful Eva Rojas and takes on a bunch of cannibals . It is all delivered with the direct panache of all Cussler novels and even though you know it 's all going to end well its how Dirk achieves it that makes it so much fun . A true thriller . ",4
"This is a beautifully written yarn that makes the unbelievable seem somehow plausible . I absolutely love this story.If you have friends that rave about Clive Cusslers books read this book and understand why . ",4
"The best by far . I 've read many Dirk Pitt novels and Sahara is my favorite followed closely by Vixen 03 and Night Probe . Cussler has done a great job tying together three seemingly obscure story lines not all of which made it into the movie obviously sorry Abe ! . For some reason I did n't think the villian General Kazim or the love interest Eva Rojas were necessarily the best same can be said for the movie ! LOL but it was the plot and all the hidden gems along the way that make this a great read . ",4
"Are they making a movie from this ? I 'm waiting to hear . Enough said . ",4
"I 'm a lifelong Cussler fan since the late 70 's when I first read 'Raise The Titanic ' and felt and still feel that it was one of the best adventure stories written . Cussler seems to never write a bad storyhowever some are just better than others . 'Sahara ' is one such story . From the opening pages when a Confederate Ironclad takes on a mysterious guest and set 's sail to places unknownto the deadly plague seeping into the ocean off the coast of Africa threatening to destroy all sea life to a really nasty bad guy who really get 's what is coming to him ala Pitt 's fiendish imagination this has just about anything and everything an adventure novel should have . I read somewhere recently that Cussler is n't the Sultan of Suspense he 's the Emperor of Action and I 'd have to agree . Swift plotting with a cast of characters you just GOT TA like and a story worthy of Cussler 's best . I particularly enjoyed Pitt & amp Giordino 's travails through the desert near death and their discovery there . As a true Dirk Pitt fan I urge you to get to know this guy . Bigger better and more creative than James Bond Pitt is more like a cross between Bond & amp an oceangoing Indiana Jones . You get the best of nifty gadgets plus the swashbuckling adventure that makes Indiana Jones so funit 's ALL HERE and in abundance too . Another discovery in the desert is also worth the price of the book too . 'Sahara ' is a fantastic fun yarn and one YOU need to take as soon as possible . Trust me you 'll be glad you did . ",4
"Sahara written by Clive Cussler is the eleventh in a series of Dirk Pitt adventurefiction books and this one is a very compelling story that really grips the reader making an engaging story till the end.Clive Cussler works some amazing threads in this book like an ironclad Confederate named Texas in 1865 as it fights through a Federal blockade and then vanishes in the Atlantic . Next in 1931 an Australian aviatrix Kitty Mannock vanishes mysteriously in the middle of the Sahara while making an attemp to fly from London to Capetown.These mysteries are only the start as Cussler works his magic of mysery further it is 1995 as the hero Dirk Pitt is called to find a Pharaoh 's funeral barge buried in the bottom of the Nile . Now we find our hero on an African adventure like none ever experienced before . An adventure that takes Dirk Pit and company on a hunt for a mysterious disease and the source of unprecedented pollution as they investigate through Africa.Of course there has to be a villian or this would n't be a Dirk Pitt savetheworld adventure as we find out this time it 's a French billionare named Yves Massarde and of course the local African connection is General Zateb Kazim the brutal despot corrupt to the core and makes life hell on Earth for the West African nation of Mali and the world as pollution is leaking and is threatening to extinguish all sea life and man as well.Clive Cussler has setup this Dirk Pitt adventure very well as you are captivated in this actionadventure and you are pulling for Pitt to make the connections and solve this engrossing story . Pitt takes a trip up the Niger River and is met with resistance but with resplendent resolutness Pitt takes on the villany but is captured.Now the story gets to a fever pitch as Cussler weaves this story making twists and turns in the plot never forgetting about action and excitement . As Pitt escapes and treks across the Sahara Cussler 's setup makes for a tale like none other.You will not be disappointed reading this book this is a classic Dirk Pitt trashes the bad guys and he always gets the girl adventure . ",4
"Read the book . This is probably one of Cussler 's best novels by and large it is very entertaining as long as you have the ability to suspend disbelief for periods of time . Cussler sets up some awesome action sequences in this story putting Dirk Pitt and the NUMA guys in trouble on rivers in Africa towns in Africa diamond mines the Sahara desert a French ForeignLegion fort a waste disposal plant none of which can stop them from pursuing the truth and owning some bad guys in the process . There is even some zombie type action in here too . The intro bit with the Confederate Ironclad CSS Texas on the James River is some rousing reading and will hook you right into the story . Take your thinking cap off and let your innereye cinema run wild while reading this and I can almost guarantee you will have a good time . ",4
"Cussler is just a great entertaining storyteller.What I like best is in the beginning of many of his books he throws in a historical event and ties his characters around it.You are thinking how is this going to have anything to do with the story I am reading but not to worry he always comes thru in a most imaginative way.I have been a fan since reading Raise the Titanic . Sahara is one of his best efforts imo and I think you will really have wonderful adventurous read peppered with memorable characters and look for Cussler to do his own Alfred Hitchcock imitation.There is a reason he is so popular and I hope I have gave a review deserving of all the hours he has given me reading . ",4
"I do n't know how I feel about this one . I enjoyed reading it in the same way I might enjoy watching whatever madefortv movie might be playing on USA on a random weeknight . My main complaint about the book was its totally bad way of giving information by way of really bad exposition . Most authors seem to be able to reveal things in a clever way that comes naturally in the story.Often it is the equivelant of writing a character who comes out and says It 's good to have you home I see that you have sucessfully driven to work and accomplished your tasks there . By the bag in your hand I can tell that you have gone to the store and purchased the bananas tomatoes and pie crusts that we needed . ",1
"Find out what its like to cross a dessert find a crashed airplane from the 1930 's and even solve the mystery of a Confederate IronClad in the middle of a dry African dessert ! All in a day for Dirk Pitt . ",4
"This was fun to read . I did n't expect it to be anything like the movie and it was n't so I was n't disappointed . I could care less about Mali so I did n't stress out about his characterization of it . I mean you ca n't take this stuff seriously because he does say that the moon landing is a farce and that Stanton hated Lincoln which was not exactly true they had profound respect for each other.. So I just went along for the ride and had fun with it.It is what it isthis is n't a book that will be in the classics section of the library but it was easy to read and a nice break from my regular tome . ",2
"This was my second Dirk Pitt book a scaled down version of Inca Gold is the other and I thought it was really fun . The action is almost non stop and keeps you on your toes . There is also a lot of fun comic relief when Dirk and Giordino are dealing with the bad guys . I do however think the book went on for too long and a 100 pages could easily have been cut out as some of the action scenes dialogue get a little overbearing . Dirk Pitt is a great character but he 's a little too perfect and it would be nice to see at least a few flaws in him.With that said this book was just an enjoyable book . I 'm a strong believer that everyone every now and then needs to read a book just for fun and if you love action and adventure then this fits the bill.P.S . The ending with the Texas and who was on the ship is a bit farfetched even for fiction but take it with a grain of salt and you can easily look past it.GREAT FUN ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ",3
"This is my first time reading a Clive Cussler novel and I loved it ! ! Yeah there is romance in there but not so much to make you gag and the action is just superb ! Dirk and Al are quite the team strong intelligent and humorous.There is the too much detail thing . My English teacher always says there is no such thing as too much detail . And well I think Mr. Cussler just proved her wrong with that . But anyways it became such a drag with so much detail but I still love the book and the movie for that matter . But they just dont seem to parallel they just collide . But that 's okay because I still like them anyways . ",3
"This is possibly my most favorite Dirk Pitt Adventure . Is it possible that Abraham Lincoln was actually kidnapped by the Confederate Army ? Cussler makes you wonder if it could have happenedjust maybe . I was thoroughly entertained throughout this book the villians were excellent Cussler made a personal appearance I loved the way Kitty Mannock came into the equation and the last stand at the fort was exceptionally facepaced . Can Dirk and Al save the world 's seas from an environmental catastrophe and still have time to save the girt ? Of course ! And that 's what makes it so much fun . ",4
"One of the best Cussler books I have read . Great fun to read . ",4
"This is the first Clive Cussler book I have ever read . Reading some of the reviews I see some people did n't like this book but I actually enjoyed this book a lot . I had been going through the bargain bin of books at the local store and found this book as a markeddown paperback . I read the back of the book and it sounded interesting so I picked it up . And I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.Yes a certain suspension of disbelief is required to enjoy this book especially the part with Abraham Lincoln . But overall the story is wellpaced the characters fun and the action interesting . There 's just so much great stuff going on I really did love this book . It might not be for everyone but if you 're looking for an action and adventure book with colorful characters fun scenes and some pretty cool historical trivia you should enjoy this book . I give it a solid 4.55 stars . ",3
"Clive Cussler 's novels are hokey and weird.. but I 'm addicted . Where else can you get a shootemup adventure and a wayoverthetop James Bondesque hero combined with oceanography history and archeology ? The plot of this one makes you wonder what Mr. Cussler was smoking but is still delightfully entertaining . Abe Lincoln 's body is resting on a Confederate ironclad in the middle of the Sahara desert and only Dirk Pitt can save the day and stop the rich industrialist polluting the oceans . ",3
"This book was near the beginning of the end for Cussler as far as I 'm concerned . It 's quite simply too stupid for words . Here his dialogue reaches new lows and the storyline is even too ridiculous for him . Ouch.bad book bad . ",0
"The last time I read Clive Cussler was around twenty years ago and the experience had not exactly had me wanting to read more . Time however dulls the memory and I 'm a different reader than I once was . When I had the opportunity to read Sahara therefore I was hopeful that the reading experience would be pleasant alas such hopes were to be crushed . Sahara is not a good book and reading it I wonder exactly what makes Cussler such a popular author maybe it 's his exotic locales and his almost nonstop action it certain is n't his ability to write.Sahara begins with a pair of prologues the first dealing with a Confederate warship disappearing at the end of the Civil War the second focusing on a female pilot crashing in the Sahara back in the 1930s . We then go to modern times where Dirk Pitt is called in to investigate a toxic waste runoff that threatens a biological catastrophe that could kill all humanity . Standing in his way is an evil dictator in Mali who is almost cartoonish in his cruelty and an equally vicious billionaire . Pitt 's adventures will lead him throughout the Sahara in a series of adventures that bring him closer to the truth while battling soldiers and the hostile desert.What about the prologue material ? It turns out to have almost nothing to do with the main story . The crashed plane is a mere plot device to rescue characters at an opportune moment and the lost ship contributes even less only really reappearing in something of an epilogue in which we get some ludicrous distortion of history . In literary terms one is a deus ex machina the other a non sequitir and any time either one of these appears in a story it is a substantial weakness . With both you have truly bad writing.The characters themselves are stiff and generally onedimensional . The villains are laughable clich & eacutes and many of the heroes are little better and between pure good and pure evil there is a Sahara of sorts with no one to be found . Then there is Dirk Pitt . A godlike man who never flinches from danger and always prevails . Even when we are not seeing him beat the odds we are having other characters praise him.There is enough cheesy dialogue to open a deli but on the plus side Cussler does have a decent though not great ability to describe settings and his action sequences are often interesting if not really exciting . Unfortunately the chief virtue in this book is to make other books seem better in comparison . For those who think I 'm being overly hostile read the far superior adventure stories of authors such as Wilbur Smith Ken Follett or even Jon Land . There are better authors out there if Sahara is typical Clive Cussler I strongly recommend skipping his books and going elsewhere . ",0
"This is Clive Cussler his books are far fetched incredible and over the top . But they are also a lot of fun if you adjust your expectations a little bit . They are adventure romps where the good guys Mr Dirk Pitt in this case can take anything and solve any riddle and always get the girl in the process.Reading this will not increase your IQ or expand your literary horizons but it will provide a few hours of entertainment.Most of Cussler books are similar so if you must read one Sahara is one of the best . ",2
"Ok so I read this after watching the movie always a mistake in my opinion . While my husband really likes Clive Cussler books and Dale Brown and Tom Clancy and the rest of the usual suspects I tend to steer away from them . Sahara the book AND the movie were interesting and kept my attention BUT I was a bit disappointed by the way Cussler tends to describe things and events in the book . My best attempt to explain would be this The Hardy Boys beat things up in their books with a minimum of fuss and nonsense . Which leaves you with a short fistfilled book . That 's rather like the way Cussler writes . When his main character Dirk Pitt is figuring out an alternative solution to a problem Cussler usually describes only the conclusion of Pitt 's thoughts and leaves his emphasis on the action that is encountered in executing Pitt 's plan . I prefer books that explain things to the reader especially a character 's thoughts and rationalizations . Sahara is a worthwhile read filled with sand and derringdo . It 's also rather fantastic in nature as it is supposed to be rather like a James Bond novel . The main characters always survive against incredible odds and the plethora of contacts that they pull in to help is unbelievable literally . And Pitt always gets the girl . literally . All in all a fun but predictable novel . ",2
"With a great historical plot twist Clive Cussler has gotten back in line with a wonderfully written Dirk Pitt novel . Pitt is back with his NUMA cohorts to save the world from an environmental threat caused by cold and callous human beings . Cussler would make XFiles creator Chris Carter proud with the historical twist regarding the Lincoln assassination . It 's a stretch but believable . Worth reading . ",3
"This is by far and wide THE BEST Clive Cussler novel he has written . Sahara is a somewhat complex plot of intrigue lost treasures tyrants and human suffering where Dirk Pitt and his NUMA pals need to discover the cause of a deadly marine red tide that could spell the end of all oxygen breathing life on earth . This book is just about impossible to put down they should make a waterproof version so you can take it in the shower with you ! ! ! ! ",4
"Not sure what happened with this book but I think in all as the title says it was about 100 pages too long and is clearly off the mark for a Cussler novel . At the end you get the feeling that Dirk Pitt is eventually going to save the Earth from crashing into the moon with a straw and 4 pounds of cabbage.Not to trash Cussler too much because he has written some solidly mindnumbing escapism novels before that have made you feel the old USA USA chant run through your head . But this one seems to be a little further over the edge of reality than his normal work.I read Cussler as a way to not think when I read and he usually does a good job . But this novel went on a bit too long and after a while too many things came together for the story to unfold as it did . Yeah I know that there is always some form of historical infringement on Dirk Pitt 's adventuire . But this was way too much convergence in one place.Ok so that 's that . But really this is a typical Cussler novel with a bit more stuff than usual . I 'm not saying it 's bad . I 'm just saying it has more Cussler . Maybe he had switched from decaf that month . Maybe he had a page quota . Who knows.Anyway Dirk and Al are there . And of course they meet up with an impractically impossible situation . And they defeat it . It 's the usual stuff for these 2 guys who always seem to find their way in and out of trouble . It 's fun . It 's crazy . And as usual it 's entertaining in the way that Cussler speaks with these 2 guys . Dialogue is always so deadpan and selfassured.And while I think that the historical stuff is a bit overdone it still is pretty neat and it takes a good twist to bring it all together . Just because it 's too much does not mean it does n't work for the desired effect . Especially if you have no problem suspending disbelief . A lot.Would I recommend this book ? Yeah I think so . But not before you read some of the other Cussler titles first . One other reviewer said that he actually laughed at some of the plot development . Well that 's pretty much basic Cussler . Some of the coincidences are crazy but that 's the author 's style . ",2
"This was a better than average Cussler effort in which Dirk and Al are sent down the Niger river delta into the Sahara to search for the source of a waterborn toxin that is poisoning the ecosystem and the locals . This conveniently dovetails with a search for a missing civil war ship and a romance with a UN health worker . Exotic dangerous and all around engaging . ",4
"This is my favorite of the Dirk Pitt series . This story is full of action and a . It of suspense as Dirk sets out to find the monitor from the civil war . The side stories in the authors books are always a second adventure within an adventure and this makes for an exciting read as they escape death multiple times all the way up until the end . ",4
"What 's sillier and even more fun than the actionadventure movie Sahara ? The original Clive Cussler novel of course.The plot is overthetop adventure as Cussler 's perrenial alter ego Dirk Pitt battles evil polluters and saves the world this time from a toxic waste facility inthe Sahara Desert duh ! Cussler has his usual themes including improbably preserved classic cars and subtle alterations of history . Meanwhile his fictitious National Underwater and Marine Agency is out there watching the ecology and keeping an eye peeled for buried treasure.There are lots of great chases quirky characters and twists and turns . Cussler 's prose never bogs down . If you like a potboiler this may be literally closer it than any other book ! Read enjoy have fun ! You do n't have to read all the Dirk Pitt novels to enjoy just this one ! And no this book is unrelated to the eponymous Humphrey Bogart movie ! ",3
"its been 10 years since I read this book and I still have n't found another book that excited me like this one . ",4
"This is clive Cussler at his best . First off the introduction with the Confederate ironclad is great . Next the setting the Sahara desert and an African river are both very intriguing and great settings . Then the plot is riveting and will keep you glued to this book for hours . This is the best Dirk Pitt adventure that I 've read so far . The villain as always is great and the ending is the finest I 've read . ",4
"if anymone came to me asked me 'sir which clive cussler book would you recommend to me ? ' i would doff my bowler hat back and reply 'Sahara ' . Sahara without a doubt in my mind is one of the best cussler moves written at his height . this is more gungho than the others and is more American like a rambo movie.its got great ideas as well as some great historical ideas . if the only critism i have it is that it is bit overlongbut still great . ",4
"Anything Clive Cussler writes is great to me . This although older I had missed and loved being able to secure it . Thank you for the great service . I live most of the year in Mexico and can not easily receive things but your service is wonderful . ",4
"Now do n't get me wrong all of CC 's books are great all four stars or better . Sahara however contains two of the best CusslerPitt scenes in his books on the riverbattle and confinement and defending the fortbattle and Giordino train conductor . My personsal favorite Dirk book . ",4
"I do n't know what I find more incredibleThat a man who claims to be a writer wrote this booka publisher actually published itreaders actually paid for it.I have never seen more childish adolescent prose in book published by a major publisher . It was so bad I put it down around page 180 only kept going that long because I kept thinking There has to be something to this if this guy 's so popular.Some people who liked the books even though the writing is bad say the action sequences and descriptions of foreign countries make up for it . I disagree . The action was not believable and the descriptions are shallower than seeing a country from group tour bus window . ",1
"This is only the second book I 've read by Clive Cussler the other one being RAISE THE TITANIC and I 'd say this one is a lot better . I really do n't see how this could n't be his best overall . This had everything . From mystery to adventure to suspense . It has it all . Mainly it 's about Dirk Pitt Al Giordino and some other character that I ca n't remember exactly . They 're trying to find this contamination in the ocean which could kill off everything on this earth in a very short time . That 's the basic plot . However their are TONS of other tieins . Everything from the goldmining cave to Al and Dirk 's adventure through the Sahara desert to a sunken Civil war ship in Africa . Storytelling does n't get much better than this . You have to read this if you like really good and fun books . ",4
"Sahara was one of the more disappointing Dirk Pitt novels I 've read . It follows the usual Cussler mold some secret historical event or treasure forms the background of the novel Pitt saves the life of a beautiful woman and then helps her with some unrelated problem that threatens the world Pitt ends up finding the treasuresecret historical event Pitt makes love to the woman and everything turns out great.This book follows that pattern but it 's missing a lot of the flare and excitement that I usually find in novels . I did n't find Pitt 's love interest very appealing in this story and there did n't seem much of a connection . It was more of a well there 's a beautiful girl lying on the beach I guess I 'll make her my love interest for this story . The story was pretty bland as well . The title centers around Pitt being trapped in the Sahara desert with his sidekick Al Giordino and being chased by a generic ruthless dictator . I found the location really boring and there did n't seem to be anything in this story I could n't find from any B action movie on cable late at night . Lastly I was really disappointed with the historical twist . Usually this is one of the great things about a Dirk Pitt novel but this one was really farfetched and cheesy and did n't invoke any excitement from me.Sahara can be looked on as a filler chapter in an otherwise great book The Dirk Pitt series . There is no character development and you will miss nothing by skipping over this book and going to the next in the series . I would n't call it a bad book at all just pretty boring and not up to the usual level of excitement I 've come to expect from Clive Cussler . ",1
"I recently caught the trailer to the movie adaptation of 'Sahara ' to be released later this year . Upon seeing this trailer the story looked like a lot of fun so I immediately purchased the book . I agree with a lot of the reviewers in that some of the dialogue is very cliche ' and cheesy but let 's face it as I think any writer will attest dialogue is not an easy thing to do . I 've also read where people think Dirk Pitt is very over the top almost to the point of being unbelievable but really is n't James Bond or Indiana Jones for instance the same type of character ? Yet people love those two . Besides that however this book was tremendous fun and the way Cussler weaves different events in history past together with the plot for his hero Dirk Pitt is truly fascinating . I enjoyed the book enough where I will pick up another Dirk Pitt adventure whenever the opportunity arises ! ",3
"This being my third Clive Cussler novel I was both entertained and annoyed while reading it . The historical parts interested me and Cussler has a clever way of making you forget things you read at the beginning of the book so that it 's surprising at the end . Other than that it follows the classic formula Cussler uses for all of his novels . Suave charming hero with the same repetitive oneliners faithful but uninspiring sidekick near death experiences and finally winning the day with some unbelievable and ridiculously clever to the extent that it hurts plot . Good for a laugh but not much else . ",3
"Ever hear the phrase suspension of disbelief ? You 'll need a truckload of it for this book . The story is entertaining enough I can see why it was made into a movie . But you 'll need to turn off the logical part of your brain as the invincible superhuman Dirk Pitt achieves one utterly implausible escape after another.Cussler finally lost me when Dirk and his pal after wandering in the Sahara Desert for days with no food or water discover a crashed airplane and manage to rebuild it into a land yacht . They ride it to safety and are restored to perfect health in moments after guzzling some water . Oh please This was my first Clive Cussler novel and I suspect it will be my last . ",1
"If you liked the movie you 'll LOVE the book . Much more exciting . A must read . ",4
"This is one of Clive Cusslers ' best ! A great adventure including treasure hunting history and a biological melt down . The movie Sahara which is an offshoot based on this book with a slightly different twist is incredible as well . With Dirk Pitt Al Giordino Rudy Gunn and Colonel Sandecker you ca n't go wrong with this one . ",4
"I have read almost all of the Pitts except for Treasure . This book was very good . I give it 4 stars . Its gon na be a movie next spring ! ! ! ",3
"Clive Cussler is a master of the modern thriller . Cussler is in a rarified group of authors who have the ability to pack in minute technical detail without bogging readers down . This is a pulse pounding page turning read ! ",3
"I first read this book in 1993 . I have n't stopped reading Clive Cussler since . I really enjoyed how he tied history into a current tale . Though they were some stretchers I appreciated how he made it come to life.Dirk Pitt is one of the most preeminent characters in literature today . The story line is simple well crafted with believable and creative characters . ",3
"The Lowdown Arguably Clive Cussler 's most popular novel besides Raise the Titanic ! and coincidentally the only other Pitt book besides Raise the Titanic ! to be made into a major motion picture.The Plot After rescuing a beautiful WHO doctor from assassins in Egypt Dirk Pitt finds himself investigating a red tide in the Niger river . Both Pitt and his WHO friend Eva begin to discover that a French zillionaire 's solar detoxification plant that supposedly destroys toxic waste is actually dumping waste in Mali with the aid of defacto dictator General Zateb Kazim and will do anything to keep it a secret including kill them.The Pros This book simply put is an epic adventure to save the world from the nastiest villains you 've ever read about . Dirk finds himself in some seriously intense situations getting enslaved in a gold mine almost dying trying to cross the Sahara with Giordino almost killing Eva to prevent her from being ravaged by the Malian military . Other Highlights include a spectacular firefight on the Niger river a juryrigged airplane ride through the desert and Dirk 's final confrontation with archfiend Yves Massarde oh poetic justice ! .The Cons There is very little to complain about in this book Cussler is on top of his game in Sahara . The obligatory scenes with squabbling politicians are always a bit of a bore and the idea of a red tide that can destroy the entire planet is a bit much to take . The only other bugaboo is that the treasure hunt aspect of the story with the missing ironclad has almost nothing to do with the main plot . ",4
"Lots of great recipes . I 've tried several and they are absolutely delicious . I was suprised how small the book was though . ",4
"this book is visually beautiful but the size of the book will make it hard to cook with even with a cookbook stand . It is small . ",3
"Do n't be fooled by the small size of this cookbook . It packs many great recipes between it 's covers . From beverages to desserts with everything in between this is a gem for delicious mexican recipes yet is feasible with a moderate level of culinary skills . I bought the first book in this series several months ago and have been consistently pleased with each new addition . ",4
"I was so skeptical of this book but I got the used version of it and do not regret it one bit . These are the types of recipes I was looking for . Comida tipica Latina nothing better than this . Recipes are awesome and right on not this fusion nonsense with apples in Salsa . Worth the buy . ",4
"Very good recipes very well explained very rich regional dishes very good pictures I really liked I recommend it . Great Mexican food ",4
"The book is small and some of the recipes are uninspired . But there are also some interesting recipes that contain ideas I would n't have thought of . ",2
"While I have not made anything from this book yet I can tell the recipes in here are the real deal . I grew up in a Mexican household but I can never seem to duplicate what we used to eat because I did not take notes while in the kitchen . This book has the recipes wirtten down just as I remember them only now I have the measurements to make them taste right . There is no modern twists or fusion mixes just straightforward authentic recipes the way they were meant to be eaten . ",4
"There is a lot of variety in this book it has some beautiful pictures with great tips fun to use ",4
"This book at first appears to be small when you get it and I will admit it is . However there are some good traditional mexican recipes in this book such as refried beans fried plantains with honey and cream Tomatillo sauce Tortilla chips Empanadas and Mushrooms and even soft tacos with chicken.There are several more recipes in the book some of which I might enjoy . I know there are bigger books out there but if you want to start small with mexican cooking this is a good place to start . ",4
"I just got this book today and it is so great ! ! The recipes look delicious and I am going to try several for dinner tonight ! I also love the small size as it packs a lot of recipes and does n't take up valuable counter space in my kitchen . The food looks really authentic and has awesome pictures with almost every recipe ! Def worth every penny ! ! ",4
"French born and 4th generation provenale I take pride in the cuisine from my homeland and I have to confess I was a little wary about what I would find in this book . Well the authors did a wonderful job at promoting the gastronomic traditions of Provence without betraying them . My grandmother our family 's headcook and our culinary inspiration would have given her seal of approval without hesitation would she have been around to discover this wonderful recipe collection and it is with her and my homeland in mind that I enjoy preparing the recipes featured in this excellent collection for my own enjoyment and the one of my American husband and our friends .

"Love cookbooks with pictures so I know how the finished product will turn out . The combinations of herbs with vegetables and meats makes for good cooking and eating . ",4
"Provence The Beautiful Cookbook by Richard Olney is a beautiful coffee table book filled with exquisite views and mouthwatering authentic dishes from this region of France.Every time I look through this book I feel like I am on an actual journey to Provence . And each time I close this book I feel a strong yearning to actually see this part of France with my own eyes ! This book is divided into food chapters like most cookbooks but also there are chapters about different areas within this region AlpesMaritimes Soups and Starters AlpesdeHauteProvence Fish and Shellfish Vaucluse Meat Poultry and Gram BouchesduRhone Vegetables and Grains Var and Desserts.A wonderful book for lovers of Provence ! ",4
"I like this book but it does point out one weakness in Provencal cookinga slight lack of variety . There are multiple gratin recipes good fish dishes etc . It also does n't shy away from organ meats etc . much like the region itself . Like all the books in this visually stunning series this one has lovely photography . ",3
"This is not only a cookbook it 's an exquisite coffee table book which is where it is now permanently sitting . ",4
"I was a little suspicious of the series . After all should we trust a book more suitably sized for the coffee table than for the kitchen counter ? But my mistrust was misguided . The food is wonderful . All people have assumptions about others and one of the assumptions Americans make about the French is that their food is very difficult to prepare and relies on expensive ingredients . The truth is that French food need not be difficult and that it is a cuisine that recognizes the beauty of each season . Since my children bought this book for me we have been building seasonal rituals around it . For example we get salt anchovies from the neighborhood Italian deli for our Christmas eve appetizer . At Mardi Gras we make the oreilles found in this book which are the pastries sold as pig 's ears or angel wings in the last days before Lent by Polish bakeries in Detroit . Depending on the bakery they were known as pig 's ears or angels wings . My only criticism of the book is that I feel the need to keep it open in the dining room lest kitchen grease spoils it . ",4
"This cookbook contains easytofollow authentic recipes from the Mediterranean . Even when the recipes are modified to accommodate multiple regional interpretations of a dish the tastes and textures remain authentic . I 'd gladly buy more books from The Beautiful Cookbook series . ",4
"'Mediterranean the Beautiful Cookbook Authentic Recipes from the Mediterranean Lands ' is one of those special books written by Joyce Goldstein that is so extensive in its survey of the various countries and the qualities that make them unique that it serves as a fine travelogue as well as offering some of the most tempting samplings of cuisines from this region ever assembled and remember this 'region includes Italian Provencal France and coastal Spain Turkey the Middle East and northern Africa Greece and the Balkans ! As each country is visited there are extensive notes about the countries their relationship and influences and the flora and fauna that inform the cuisines from food scholar Ayla Aygar . The photography is as superb both of the landscapes and cities and the people AND of course the foods.The recipes offered here are unique in that they are geared toward healthy eating something not all cookbooks from other countries include ! Here are recipes easily carried out in the standard American kitchen with information on how to find ingredients locally . The writing is casually refined and the recipes are easy to follow.For a book that will encourage the reader to extend that trip to one country to enjoy the kaleidoscopic magnificence of the entire Mediterranean this richly illustrated volume is on the top of the list . Buy it before it slips out of print ! Highly recommended . Grady Harp December 05 ",4
"I purchased 5 books in this series over time and just ordered more from Amazon . I have a strong interest in cooking but have been weeding cookbooks out . Still I bought these for numbers of reasons including the quality and uniqueness of the books as well as for the recipes.These books are oversized 14 X 10 conceptually a coffee table book format . Some are hard cover versions more recent versions are soft cover . Soft covers have no other compromises per quality of the pages photos and content . However the size and softer covers make them less flexible to store.They all have gorgeous photos of the areas from which the recipes are taken . Included are a few pages summarizing the history of how various foods came to the areas and how food preferences transitioned throughout history . As another overview point many recipes are one full page and each page has large color photos of the finished dishes . Glossaries and indices are located at the end of each book . These are not travel or restaurant guides yet they can inspire a desire to check flight schedules.When I purchased this book I had in mind food from Greece and a few other countries . Check a map there 's one included in the book . This book has recipes from all the countries touching the Mediterranean Sea . With so many countries you could guess that this is n't all inclusive thus the reason for my 4 rating to assure this is known but there 's a variety of recipes from the different countries in each section . Most recipes have an overview about the dish and some have different versions per how it is cooked in the various countries.The book is organized in this order Appetizers Breads Soups and Shellfish Meats Poultry and Game Vegetables Pasta and Grains Desserts Preserves and Beverages . Each category is preceded by a more detailed overview of food in the varied countries or areas but each food category does have a variety of recipes from the various countries . The country sections are Spain France Italy Greece and the Balkans Turkey the Middle East and North Africa . The Glossary has some recipes for some items if you ca n't find them prepared in your local markets.I 've used these books as reference guides for various dishesfor the recipesand for just learning more about food and cooking throughout the world . Regardless of how many cook books you own for those regions of interest I would expect most people who enjoy cooking as a hobby or as a passion would enjoy these books to various degrees . ",3
"My neighbors Tom and Julia who know my passion for the Mediterranean region gave me this book yesterday as a surprise gift . I have traveled the world tasted many different cuisines and I came to a conclusion that when it comes to La Dolce Vita Joie de Vivre and Good Food nothing compares to tasty healthy Mediterranean diet and life style . I am telling you folks it 's the best in the world . This book is a good representation of the cuisines from the region and has many delicious recipes from Turkey to Italy from Israel to Tunisia . Especially those mouthwatering Turkish recipes in this book are easy to make . The book also has wonderful colored photos of the region accompanied by articles on each country in the area.The Turkish cuisine which has long been rated by European experts as one of the best in the world together with French and Chinese is not all that known in this country . This is partly due to the small size of the Turkish American society and partly the lack of publicity on Turkish resort towns in North America . However with this book you do not have to wait until you visit Istanbul to try those dishes . This is one book you 'll use over and over again even if you immigrate to Europe because the recipes in this book contain measurements both in English and metric.This is the third cookbook we have in our collection by Joyce Goldstein and I can tell you that this experienced cookbook author together with coauthor Ayla Algar have outdone themselves in this book . ",4
"This large format softcover book has beautiful pictures of various locations in the Mediterranean as well as great pictures of almost every dish for which there is a recipe . The recipes are easy to follow measurements in English and metric with a helpful notation about the recipe at the start of each one . More importantly they are useful dishes that you can acutally cook not one of those books with 20 different ways to cook octopus . Where a particular local indgrediant is probably not available stateside a creditable alternative is given . The book looks tasty to the eye and the recipes are tasty as well . I am particularly fond of Turkish food and this cuisine is well represented just as the other Mediterranean countires are . ",4
"Really coffee table quality with beautiful pictures . Only drawback is that it is very large and would be awkward on my kitchen counter as I have a really small kitchen if I wanted to have it open to cook a recipe . It is a cross between the Tess Mallos Middle Eastern cook book and the old TimeLife series . Lots of narrative of local customs along with lovely photographs . A really nice addition to my cook books . ",3
"This book is a fun book to keep on hand.Most of the phrases are bizarrelike Sometimes I get this urge to conquer large parts of europe interdum feror cupidine partium magnarum Europae vincendarumbut it is still a fun book.I especially enjoy throwing in some latin phrases in email correspondence with friends to keep them guessing . ",2
"I bought this book while taking a Latin Class with a good yet slightly dull teacher . During break we would write little Latin Phrases on the board such as Nescio qomodo illud in sinum meum intraverit . Really made the class much better . ",4
". . . but that 's only because the common rabble would have loved it ! Henry Beard has given the Latin enthusiast and aspiring perennial pest a laughaminute phrasebook that tells you how to say just about everything from Darn ! There goes my beeper ! to I 'll have a hamburger French Fries and a thick shake . The entries are all conveniently sorted out into twelve categories separated by some really funny drawings such as Lingua Latina Conlocutioni Conversational Latin and Lingua Latina Vitae Communi Social Latin which makes finding the perfect greeting or insult a lot easier . There 's even a handy little pronunciation guide so you 'd be able to say what you want in perfect Latin . So the next time you find yourself in ancient Rome be ready to beat the loquacious Cicero down with some good oldfashioned small talk by having a copy of Lingua Latina Occasionibus Omnibus tucked somewhere in your toga ! ",4
"Imagine my surprise when I opened this book thinking it was going to be a standard Latin phrase book and encountered In dentibus anticis frastrum magnam spinaciae habes You have a big piece of spinach stuck in your teeth . By the time I 'd leafed my way through Excuses Hostes alienigeni me abduxeunt . Qui annus est ? I was kidnapped by aliens . What year is it ? Curses Utinam barbari spatium proprium tuum invadant ! May barbarians invade your personal space ! and Table Talk Noli ludere alimento ! Memento Carthiginienses esurientes ! Do n't play with your food . Remember the starving Carthaginians ! I was laughing so hard I was seized with an attack of the hiccups which I still have not recovered from.I should have read the author 's bio first . Henry Beard was the cofounder of the National Lampoon . That pretty much says it all.If you know anybody who has studied Latin this book would make an absolutely stupendous gift . My birthday is coming up soon just in case you were wondering . Even if you have n't studied Latin this book is guaranteed to tickle your funny bone.Radicitus comes ! Radical dude ! ",4
"This wonderful little book was presented to me many years ago after I had completed a Latin seminar . It was a wonderful gift and I have found much use for the various phrases and an extraordinary amount of humour that can be derived from the blandest of statements when translated into Latin . For example the innocuous phrase 'Darn ! There goes my beeper ! ' becomes quite funny in LatinHeu ! Tintinnuntius meus sonat ! One has visions of Caesar fumbling through his tunic for some beeping object.So if you need a little Latin on the golf course Alterum ictum faciam on the tennis court minime latum ! at the beach when spotting a shark Pistrix ! Pistrix ! or you just need to say Illud Latine dici non potest you ca n't say that in Latin you 'll be prepared with this volume.It even comes with a section on what to say when at the Vatican where it might truly come in handy . For instance you might need to say 'Ubi possum potiri petasi similis isti ? ' when passing a cardinal or nun translation Where can I get a hat like that ? .So do n't waste your time on watching reruns of Insula Gilliganis or game shows such as Periculum and Rota Fortunae pick up this book today and merge the worlds past and present.Die dulci fruere . Have a nice day . ",4
"To put a little fun into studying Latin it fills the bill just fine . I would recommend it as a supplemental reading . ",3
"I have never written a book review before I 've finished a book but this one has had me in stitches since I opened the front cover . After seeing it on the shelf of my local bookstore I picked it up and Latin for all Occasions has made my day.Where else can one read lines like Prehende uxorem meam sis ! Take my wife please ! or Braccae tuae hiant Your fly is open . For those who have studied Latin or who simply have an appreciation for it this book is for you . As for me Velim sumere Mariam Sanguinariam sis I 'll have a Bloody Mary please . ",4
"This is a rather unusual book with all manner of everyday and bizarre sayings nicely translated into Latin for your amusementeducationuse at a dinner party . Just as with his very funny French for Cats the real humour lies in the really odd things he has taken the time to translate things like I believe that Elvis is still alive.It is a good fun coffee table book and a must for any serious collector of great humour books . ",4
"I am currently a Latin student and will be using this book to amuse and annoy my teacher.Latin is one of my favorite subjects and this is certainly a great addition to your textbooks.Vale lacerte ! ",4
"This is a funny book . I was so surprized to see it could be used for Modern satire . My husband and I have shared a few great laughs . ",4
"I highly recommend picking up this book as well as its companion volume Latin for Even More Occasions . Latin scholars will find them useful as well as humorous as the English phrases translated are usually familiar ones and so the Latin declension endings and syntax become more clearly defined . Perfect for your Latinloving high school or college student or even for the casual linguist looking for highbrowed humor . ",4
"this little book has pictures with ideas for garnishments not just syrup and butter . I am one who is inspired by the pictures I wo n't by a cookbook without it and looking at the pictures in this book makes you want to start cooking !

"Have tried several of the recipes always good . Have gifted the book twice with a waffle maker and a couple of utensils great shower gift . Biggest reason for me to own it display it front and center of my cookbook collection . It is attractive and very small a great addition with fabulous pictures to accompany delicious recipes . ",4
"I purchased this book to use in a gift basket . I put it with a waffle maker and some flavored syrup . It was a good finishing touch for the basket which I donated to a local nursing home for them to raffle off . ",4
"Yum some interesting recipes ! ",4
"I loved it . I read a great deal while traveling but only write review that are five stars as I do n't have time for anythingless . This book I found to be very well put together and researched there might have been a few bumps or places I might have said maybe but in general and as a whole I love it and will recommend it to others . I am a member of the Aspen Book Club in Colorado the Brooklyn Hatters Book Club The Manhattan Book club the European book club and the Linnenbach Readers Book club . I have to say that I am on the move on the road so often that read has become an outlet and using Amazons reader a great way to reduce the hours 5 cheers to this author I am very happy with this book and will recommend it to others .

"In Double Lives Professor Koch meticulously details the manipulation by the Soviets ' master propagandist Willi Munzenberg of thousands of European and American progressive intellectuals in the innerwar period of the 1920s and 1930s by his vast publishing network and interlocking front organizations under the covert direction of the Communist International Comintern and the Soviet secret services of the NKVD and the GRU.He particularly concentrates upon the intellectual elite that fell under Munzenberg 's sway in this cultural war against the West.This includes such persons as Ernest Hemingway John Steinbeck Andre ' Malraux Andre ' Gide Pablo Picasso Dorothy Parker George Grosz Lincoln Steffens John Dos Passos Bertolt Brecht Lillian Hellman Dashiell Hammett and Sidney and Beatrice Webb.This volume shatters myth after historical myth of this critical period.Munzenberg Koch states developed what may well be the leading moral illusion of the twentieth century the notion that in the modern age the principal arena of the moral life the true realm of good and evil is political.The notion that the ethical is the political and that the highest form of ethical expression was antifascism with the Soviet Union as the publiclyidentified ideologically most dedicated opponent of fascism thus holding the moral high ground.This myth was actually built upon the basest of lies.As Koch demonstrates from the earliest days of the National Socialist regime in Germany beginning with the Reichstag Fire less than a month after Hitler became Chancellor a sinister covert relationship existed between Nazi secret intelligence and their Soviet counterpart.This clandestine cooperation continued throughout the decade Hitler 's massacre of Ernst Rohm and his S. A. leadership in the Night of the Long Knives Stalin 's terror purge of CPSU party members feckless intellectuals military officers most notably Field Marshal Tukhachevsky 's betrayal by documents forged in a Gestapo laboratory and the murder of tens of millions of ordinary Soviet citizens reaching its culmination in the HitlerStalin NonAggression Pact of August 1939.Publicly the Soviet Union and their international Popular Front network of what were secretly designated useful idiots or Innocents ' Clubs preached antifascism.Covertly Stalin sought accommodation appeasement and eventual alliance with Hitler.Besides fascinating details dealing with the duplicitous Reichstag Fire trials the Cambridge Five British espionage scandal the Spanish Civil War as an international component to Stalin 's Great Terror and finally Muzenberg 's own mysterious murder one of the most intriguing aspects of Koch 's study involves the use of women espionage agents.Many of the ` Muzenbergmen ' were women . The Russian writer and historian Nina Berberova writes with astringent authority about a cohort of agents or nearagents the women whom she calls the ` Ladies of the Kremlin.These were women who became influential figures in European and American intellectual life partly on their own but above all through the men in their lives . The men most often were famous writers ` spokesmen for the West ' Meanwhile the consorts whom they most trusted were guided by the Soviet services.Leading this list were two members of the minor Russian aristocracy the Baroness Moura Budberg who was mistress to both Maxim Gorky and H. G. Wells and the Princess Maria Pavlova Koudachova . Moura Budberg 's links to the Soviets were shadowy and remained secret for decades until they were at last exposed by the Russian historian Arkady Vaksberg in his 1997 book The Gorky Secret . We have more certain knowledge about the Princess Koudachova who first became secretary later mistress wife and at last widow to the once enormously celebrated pacifist novelist Romain Rolland.Maria Pavlova Koudachova was an agent directly under Soviet secret service control . There is some questionable evidence to suggest that she was trained and assigned to Rolland 's life even before she left Russia after the Revolution . . . That she was a secret service operative however and one expressly planted in Rolland 's life can not be doubted . Babette Gross commonlaw wife of Willi Munzenberg put it to me plainly in the summer of 1989 . ` She was an apparatchik ' she said flatly . ` And she ran him . ' Koch page 28.Koch proceeds to discuss other women deep within the Communist apparat such as the American Ella Winter and their distinguished men of distinction.In Winter 's case the men were pioneer muckraking journalist Lincoln Steffens and upon his death Hollywood screenwriter Donald Ogden Stewart part of Hemingway 's circle immortalized in The Sun Also Rises.Stewart was the Academy Awardwinning author of The Philadelphia Story and one of the highestpaid screenwriters of the day notes Kenneth Lloyd Billingsley in Hollywood Party How Communism Seduced the American Film Industry in the 1930s and 1940s Crown Forum 1998 . He was also one of the most vociferous guardians of the Party line especially through the vexatious days of the NaziSoviet Pact Billingsley page 82.Upon reading these various accounts a pattern soon develops.The profiles were remarkably similar.The men were all internationally known novelists artists playwrights etc . celebrated for their independence of mind their supposed integrity of spirit but in actuality men who were manipulated by their muses.The technique proved very successful in this inner war period.There is no reason to believe that the Communist intelligence services ceased to use such agents of influence during the years of the Cold War.Yoko Ono phone your office .

"Over all an interesting but fatally flawed book.The writing is in parts truly appaling . Some of the sweeping statements made throughout the book that certain individuals or their wives were obviously stalinist agents working for the undermining of america or western society are unsupported or utter conjecture . Indeed parts of the book read like a rant against leftist intellectuals and writers leveling accusations and condemnations at them solely on the basis that they were leftist therefore obviously they were the tools of stalin . Trying to link the cambridge spies to Munzenberg on the flimsiest of evidence seems like stretching reality to create the legend of munzenberg rather than recounting the history of the man.Reading some of the other reviews it seems that this book appeals to those people that seemly already share a deep distrust and loathing of dangerous leftwing academics that seem to be trying to undermine american values . This book will no doubt provide barbecue talking points for white collar rednecks so they can heap scorn upon and ignore any academic or spokesperson that questions the statusquo . They will be able to discount any person that does not agree with their own elightened position on the grounds that theytheir universityinstituteetc was established or funded by the soviets to produce nothing but antiamerican propaganda and can therefore be ignored.So an interesting book putting forward very interesting ideas but sadly poorly written in parts poorly researched and comes across as a damnatio of C20th intellectuals . Overall this book would appeal to the america god and guns brigade . ",1
"Probably the most astonishing item in this book comes from the author 's interview with Babette Willi Muenzenberg 's wife at the age of 91 . She was by no means senile she was ancient but in top form . She had long ago abandoned Communism and become a sharp critic of that murderous ideology . But she knew where the corpses were buried . When our author asked her But what about Sacco and Vanzetti ? she just gave him a little smile and said That was Willi 's idea.What ? ! ? ! How could that possibly be true ? The explanation lies in this book which will really make you dizzy as you recognize the items of Soviet disinformation one at a time . It finally turns into a case of wheels within wheels where the dedicated enemies Hitler and Stalin nevertheless wind up cooperating with one another in a sort of Satanic waltz . For example Hitler wanted to eliminate a large number of German Communists . No problem said Stalin and provided him with a list of German Communists that Stalin wanted dead.If you read this book you will suddenly come to a very different understanding of historical reality . For example if you read that Felix Frankfurter and Lincoln Steffens both loudly and publicly deplored the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti you will understand why.This is an extremely valuable book which belongs on the shelf of anyone interested in the history of the twentieth century .

"As archives and witnesses in formerly Communist lands have become available to historians we better understand the significance played by Western intellectuals promoting the Soviet agenda . In Double Lives Stalin Willi Munzenberg and the Seduction of the Intellectuals New York Enigma Books 2004 completely revised and updated Stephen Koch details the tangled web of espionage and subversion spun by one of Lenin 's and Stalin 's premier agents Willi Munzenberg a German communist who covertly directed propaganda operations in the West p. 5 . He mastered both the arts of spreading propaganda and enlisting fellow travelers shaping public opinion through various Popular Front mechanisms to garner support for the Soviet position.He wanted to instill the feeling like a truth of nature that seriously to criticize or challenge soviet policy was the unfailing mark of a bad bigoted and probably stupid person while support was equally infallible proof of a forwardlooking mind committed to all that was best for humanity and marked by an uplifting refinement of sensibility p. 15 . He did so by coopting public opinion in democratic countries and then denying he 'd actually done so . He organized in all the media newspapers film radio books magazines the theater . Every kind of ` opinion maker ' was involved writers artists actors commentators priests ministers professors ` business leaders ' scientists psychologists anyone at all whose opinion the public was likely to respect p. 15.He shrewdly manipulated scores of leftleaning intellectuals fellow travelers whom he disdainfully called the innocents . He played upon man 's hunger for righteousness for an inner sense of making the world a better place . More than perhaps any other person of his era he developed what may well be the leading moral illusion of the twentieth century the notion that in the modern age the principal arena of the moral life the true realm of good and evil is politics p. 20 . Thus the lost generation of the ` 20swriters and artists such as Lincoln Steffens and John Dos Passos Ernest Hemingway Bertolt Brecht and a cadre of Hollywood screenwriters and wealthy donors cultivated by another Soviet agent Otto Katzwere Munzenberg 's primary targets.Hemingway an unchallenged celebrity in the ` 20s and ` 30s was as important to Munzenberg as Andre Gide the French novelist . His literary style providing a model for scores of writers elicited an acclaim from all quarters . He became the most influential moralist of the Word in his era and consequently all three of the principal leaders of the Hollywood Popular FrontLillian Hellman Dashiel Hammett and Dorothy Parkerwere writers whose prose vulgarized Hemingway 's style p. 309 . Hemingway 's prominent role in supporting the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War opened the door for Soviet apparatchiks looking for propaganda opportunities . He was not himself a communist only one of the useful idiots so easily manipulated by Munzenberg 's men.Since the Bolsheviks saw America as a serious threat to their endeavors it was necessary to awaken a worldwide antiAmericanism to instill a reflexive loathing of the United States and its people p. 41 . Alienated intellectuals looking for righteous causes were easily massaged by Munzenberg 's ministrations . The celebrated SaccoVanzetti case for example was almost wholly his creation and he worked through a committee led by Gardner Pat Jackson a prominent liberal of the day who persuaded Marion Frankfurter the wife of Felix Frankfurter a Harvard law professor who later became a Supreme Court Justice to rally support for the accused killers . When Sacco and Vanzetti were executed Professor Frankfurter wrote an impassioned defense of them that appeared in the Atlantic and was widely circulated to assail the injustices of the American judicial system.During the ` 20s and ` 30s Munzenberg also promoted pacifism in the West seeing it as a way to weaken and if possible disarm the democracies that might oppose the USSR . Communists of course were not pacifists ! They relished class war and attained their dictatorial goals through violence . But they knew how peace and nonviolence appeal to idealists so they frequently worked through innocents intent on making the world a paradise through good intentions . Bolsheviks such as Munzenberg thus easily found cooperative mouthpieces for their cause among Quakers and likeminded liberal Christians who made opposition to all war an item of faith.The world changed dramatically when Hitler seized power in the ` 30s . Munzenberg fled his native Germany and found refuge in Paris where he continued his subversive activities promoting the Soviet agenda . The Reichstag Fire in Berlin for example generated an enormous propaganda war as various factions both Nazi and Communist were blamed and political advantages gained in the aftermath . Sitting in exile in Switzerland Thomas Mann the great German novelist concluded that 'in the final analysis the origin of the fire may itself remain as mysterious and elusive as the intellectual and subjective line dividing National Socialism from communism . As I see it the unconscious meaning of the trial lies in its exposure of the closeness the kinship yes even the identity of National Socialism and communism . Its fruit will be to push to absurdity the hatred between the two camps and their idiotic determination to annihilate each other when in fact there is no need for such enmity . They are kindred though divergent manifestations of one and the same historical situation the same political world and are even less separable than are capitalism and Marxism . Symbolic outbreaks like the Reichstag going up in flames are we sense even if we can not prove it their joint work ' pp . 132133.In England Munzenberg 's apparatus drew wealthy privileged students into the Cambridge Conspiracy . Similar work was done in every country of interest to the Bolsheviks p. 180 . In America recruiters targeted Ivy League colleges . Elite gifted youngsters easily adopt an adversary or countercultural stance regarding the establishment that enables them to live so comfortably . This adversary culture appeals especially to vigorous intellectual and artistic youngsters who relish a radicalism that seems to represent freedom and truth . They want to tear aside the bourgeois faade and stand strong for the deepest truth ever known p. 189 . Thus young men in England such as Guy Burgess and Kim Philby Americans including Alger Hiss and Michael Straight whose family owned the New Republic magazine were recruited for the communist cause . Young women too played an invaluable role . Ella Winter served as Felix Frankfurter 's secretary at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference guided the steps of her first husband the famous muckraker Lincoln Steffens and ultimately became one of the most trusted party agents for the West Coast working with special effectiveness within the Hollywood community.Given their elite standing these youngsters naturally enjoyed easy entry into the highest realms of government academe the media and arts . And they were ordered to ever support the Soviet cause and undermine Western democracies . They were of course never to admit this . Willi Munzenberg 's widow Babette Gross an invaluable source for this book remembered these agents ' approach You do not endorse Stalin . You do not call yourself a Communist . You do not declare your love for the regime . You do not call on people to support the Soviets . Ever . Under any circumstances p. 249 . Rather You claim to be an independentminded idealist . You do n't really understand politics but you think the little guy is getting a lousy break . You believe in openmindedness . You are shocked frightened by what is going on right here on our own country . You are frightened by the racism by the oppression of the workingman p. 250 . But in fact all of these agents took their orders from Moscow ! In time Munzenberg along with virtually all veteran Bolsheviks fell from Stalin 's favor . He managed to avoid execution through various shrewd maneuvers but he died hanged under mysterious circumstances soon after German forces invaded France in 1940 . Double Lives reads much like a mystery novel but it deals with some of the most historically significant currents of the 20th century . ",4
"I 'm glad that I bought my own personal copy of this incredible piece of research written from a critical perspective and wellwritten stylistically at that . If only all cultural criticism were as incisive as this . ",4
"Anyone interested in the ideas that have shaped the cultural and political face of the 20th century should read this book because it sheds an uncompromising light on the activities which went on behind the scenes and identifies the strings which were being pulled to move the actors on the stage . More often than not the players remained completely unaware of the objectives they helped to promote and their public was led by the nose impressed by the cultural celebrities that showed them the way.Stephen Koch 's book now available in its second printing may there be a third ! highlights the communist undercover propaganda activities in the West that formed Moscow 's ideological spearhead in the 1920s and 1930s . It tells the often tragic stories of the men and women doing the work who thought they were helping to create a better world and often ended up dangling from Stalin 's gallows or as nonentities in the endless plains of the Gulag.In the early days of the Bolshevik empire this propaganda was aimed primarily at the capitalist countries it was to promote the cause of the forgotten masses to fight the lost but glorious causes of victims like Sacco and Vanzetti to eliminate local rivals and to establish goodwill in intellectual circles . Capitalism was obviously the class enemy number one but intially the campaign lacked a political foe although Italian fascism another liberatory ideology that sprang up after the first World War had at least given the enemy a name.From that point of view Hitler 's sudden rise in Germany spurred by the Depression which struck Germany hardest of all industrialized nations was a godsend for communist cause . Now there was a way for Moscow to get a free entry ticket into the ruling circles of the Capitalist world . Stalin could now sell to the society he was trying to eliminate a glossy magazine describing Hitler 's evil deeds and the pitch was made so much easier because the claims could be verified on the spot not many people toured the Soviet Union unaccompanied by local guides . Anyone more or less was able to travel to Berlin or into the German provinces to view the astonishing and to many people threatening changes that were taking place there . For most observers it was preferable to get their goosebumps closer to home in an environment they knew fairly well rather than attempt to satisfy their curiosity by visiting the Red Empire.The person who had forged Moscow 's propaganda organization abroad from the very beginning and who had immediately identified the new objectives by producing the Brown Book which blamed the Reichstag fire on the Nazi 's themselves was Willi Muenzenberg a man born in Germany and one of Lenin 's personal aides . Stalin supplied him with whatever means he needed to seduce the intellectual elites both in Europe and in America leaving to Willi the choice of the treatment money women publicity to be aplied in each particular case be it Bertolt Brecht or Dorothy Parker Ernest Hemingway or Picasso Andr ? Malraux or the Mann family.Anything that would disparage Hitler and his ideas would be used to advantage the result was a worldwide political constellation of strange bedfellows fundamentally opposed each other . At a critical moment it created a common groundswell which engulfed the center of Europe and pushed the rest of the continent to the edge of an abyss where it was to remain for half a century . To achieve his ends Willi and the alltoowilling writers he had bought in one way or another were not afraid to use the Lie on a grand scale . Paris was their HQ . According to Stephen Koch Malraux ' report of a trip to Berlin he undertook in early 1934 to secure the release of Dimitroff was a fabrication and a fraud p. 129f . Koch states that the Oberfohren memorandum supposedly a German account of the horrors perpetrated by the SA and published in the Manchester Guardian was a pure piece of black propaganda p. 157 written by one of M ? nzenberg 's men . Countless other such fabrications were circulated and poisoned the soul of western culture and civilization.By 1939 once the HitlerStalin pact had allowed the great European War to start however Muenzenberg became expendable like so many other communists who fell from grace . Stalin eliminated the international activities which Moscow had so strongly promoted for more than two decades . When the German army moved into France Willi fled south from Paris but never reached a safe haven in Switzerland or Spain . Many months later his dead body was found in a forest on his escape route . Stephen Koch is hesitant as to how Willi died whether by his own hands or by those of Stalin 's men . He also allows for a Blitzaktion of the Gestapo but this is unconvincing because the Wehrmacht had not yet reached that area and even if the Germans had been looking for him and been aware of his whereabouts in those tumultuous days of the collapse of France they would certainly not have failed to interrogate such an important personality before any act of revenge whereas the Soviet Union for both political and tactical reasons would have been most eager to silence him at the first opportunity.In spite of a few questionable theses Double Lives is a highly recommendable book which can be placed alongside Christopher Andrew 's Mitrokhin Archive and St ? phane Courtois ' Black Book of Communism without any reservations .

"For the Wagner enthusiast a must read if you can get past the verbosity . Here is no musical analysis this volume has nothing in common with the numerous leitmotif anthologies that have been written and recorded since the composer 's day . Rather it is a view of the music dramas in terms of the psychological and philosophical motivations of the characters . Serious Wagner scholars may challenge Tanner 's conclusions whereby he views all the works as coming out of a common theme hero and rescue and the role of art . Tanner sees the operas from Das Rheingold on as working through the pessimistic lenses of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche.Oddly there is no mention of Die Sieger Wagner 's prose sketch of a HinduBuddhist drama which closely matches Parsifal . Rather Tanner views Parsifal entirely in Christian terms ignoring the subtle Buddhist themes . Indeed Wagner became interested in eastern religion vegetarianism and antivivisectionism . Tanner makes no mention of this and gives scant attention to Wagner 's devotion to the Greek dramatists . Since Wagner was a gifted composer it seems unlikely that his operas can be given a just account without fully describing his use of music to fill out the psychological and philosophical aspects of the dramas.Other reviewers have commented on the incomprehensible style in which this book is written . Did Tanner attempt to imitate Wagner 's prose with some choice Anglicanisms thrown in for good measure vouchsafe really ? . Occasionally sentences seem to sag under their own weight defying common rules of grammar.In much of the Wagner literature there is often a rather shallow discussion of the dramas in terms of character and message . Tanner seeks to remedy this and hopefully others will follow his path as well . ",3
"Michael Tanner a British philosopher who has written about Nitzsche offers an analysis of Wagner and his works . I do not recommend this book as an introductory biography of Wagner . Rather Tanner discusses the controversy surrounding Wagner . He notes that Wagner 's genuine antiSemitism womanizing and both left wing and right wing politics would be forgiven if his critics did n't find something in his music to reinforce their hostility towards him . This observation encapsulizes the mystique surrounding Wagner . Just about everything about him from his personal life to his philosophy to his music arouses passion.After analyzing Wagner in general Tanner does an opera by opera review concentrating on the meaning and philosophical underpinnings of each . This is no entry level plot summary rather Tanner dissects Wagner 's works on a deeper level . In reading this book it would be helpful if the reader was already familiar with Wagner 's operas . Tanner covers Wagner 's earlier operas which were fairly traditional with melodic area 's and duets and traces his evolution to the great musical dramatist that he became culminating in the four opera Ring Cycle . If you seek to familiarize yourself with Wagner this book is probably not for you . If you seek to gain an understanding of Wagner this book is highly recommended . ",4
"If only all Wagner criticismanalysis was as sane as this little volumeSimply put this ranks near the top of the mountain of books on Richard Wagner and certainly as one the very best books about him released within the last 10 years.Tanner gives some incredible insights such as seeing Tristan und Isolde as a humanist religious work this insight spurred an entire book also well worth checkingout called DeathDevoted Heart by noted philosopher Roger Scruton.Perhaps the greatest value that this excellent book possesses is Tanner 's rebuttal of the usual criticisms of Wagner . Everybody knows the Wagner was an amoral Casanova with protoNazi tendencies . Actually the truth is far more interesting and while Tanner does n't whitewash Wagner 's repulsive antiSemitism he brings it into considerably sharper focus than most Wagner scribes.This is a welcome antidote to the shrill screeds that seem to be churned out constantly by the antiWagner lobby while at the same time a measured and sober look at Wagner 's artistic achievements . Highly recommended ! ",4
"While the concepts in this book are edifying the language in which it is written is at times almost incomprehensible . One wonders whether the author first wrote this in German and then translated it into English and then while translating added parenthetical asides that had n't occurred to him in the original writing . ",2
"This book takes a very proWagner attitude . The author is obviously erudite being dean of Christ College Cambridge . He knows his stuff . He generally defends Wagner from the criticisms of him though he does n't deny that Wagner had flaws.The sentences are needlessly long and complex . This book cries out for a more aggressive editor . The content is good though.This book is comparable to Bryan Magee 's The Tristan Chord Wagner and Philosophy not in content but in approach . Magee also takes a very proWagern apologetic approach . ",2
"Michael Tanner has produced a gem of a book . Tanner brings his philosophical skills to bear on the meanings to be found in Wagner 's music dramas . While I strongly disagree with Tanner 's somewhat Nietzschean philosophical positions I have found engaging with his thought on Wagner most valuable . It is interesting to contrast his atheistic interpretation of Parsifal with Lucy Beckett 's defence of the idea that it is a profoundly Christian work . Whoever is right Tanner writes beautifully and always makes his points in an intellegient and often convincing manner . If you like Wagner 's music and want to know more read it his book on Nietzsche 's good too . ",4

"Wow . This book is definitely comprehensive . Wiseman 's book on Wilderness Survival is great for people to survive in the wilderness on nothing . This book is written for people in Britain that have never seen civilization . I guess I was looking for a type of survival book to cover how to survive in an urban setting in a major disaster . This book covers everything from do n't eat moth balls to do n't plant willow trees too close to your house or you might weaken your foundation . Most of the stuff is ridiculous common sense.The one area I was interested in was SelfDefense . Unfortunately this was just a lot of British Law stuff.Overall the book is pretty comprehensive but more or less ridiculous . You have to be insane to read it cover to cover .

"Urban life is unique in many ways . Life can be easy one day and tough the next . Urban life presents unique problems stress pollution robberies and so on . Life in the urban environment can also be pleasurable by being socially involved and enjoying a wellpaid job.The book Urban Survival is about how to survive daybyday in the urban world . Unlike other survival books Urban Survival is not so much about the worst case but rather common mistakes that can be made and how to prevent such mistakes from happening . Most of the facts are common sense but they can be easily overlooked in the urban world . The book ranges from common doityourself accidents to the more extreme such as robberies and terrorism and natural disasters . The book makes a good effort to keep your home secure from hazards from both inside and outside . The book is n't about how to make your home a fortified fortress capable of stopping a massive invasion and arming yourself with the latest weaponry as a matter of fact the book is against using a gun for defensive reasons since it 's very well possible that the weapon can be used against you or hurt someone you do n't intend to hurt . No this book is about how to enjoy your life in the urban world while keeping in mind about safely and playing it safe .

"This book is a tragic waste of time and is representative of the Cowering European Ethos that will destroy that continent . It is written primarily for an ignorant British audience consisting of people too simple to understand basic principles of home improvement and too cowardly to defend themselves . More than half the book consists of keeping yourself safe from your own house falling apart . The rest of the book tells you stupid things like a brick in your house could be considered an offensive illegal weapon . I 'm sure this is true in the halfwit nanny state Across the Pond but not so much in what 's left of the Land of the Free . If you want a good picture of the mindset that allowed a bunch of punks to riot in London this Summer while everyone stood politely and helplessly by take a look at this book . This was the first item I borrowed from the Kindle Lending Library and I am so happy I paid nothing for it because it is a literary vampire that will suck the life force out of anyone misfortunate enough to buy it.Sorry to go on so much about this book but in 400+ reviews I 've done on Amazon this is the worst thing I 've seen so far .

I read the description and table of contents before buying which lead me to believe that this book would offer practical advice for living in the city when things get dangerous . It does not . This is only a book for a person without common sense advising how to live within a normal day without killing or maiming yourself with your own stupidity . The best information was the section on first aid . However if you ever took a babysitting course or did any sort of boy scouts or girl scouts you already know more than what is in this book . ",0

"This book is great as a condensed version of the original . It is great for taking along on hikes or other trips where you do n't have the space or weight available for larger guides .

"Note This is a pocket size version of the original 1996 edition which was printed in a double column format . While containing half the number of pages the original edition was bulkier and less amenable to be carried around.Survival in the context of both editions refers to the survival from everyday hazards falls house fires floods burglaries muggings and alike . It is not oriented to urban survivalists . The book is much more of an everyday safety manual with advise on fire safety electrical safety safety using ladders and hand tools general first aid and common poisons that exist around the house . There are sections on home security and a little about selfdefense with drawings showing things like defending against a choking attack and the proper way to punch without damaging your hand . I found the sections on poisonous plants fungi insects and snakes to be very useful especially the one on plants as children often eat them and it is important to realize that many are highly poisonous.The book is divided into twelve sections1 . Essentials covering general things like what should be in an urban survival kit and having the proper mindset and everyday things like pollution2 . Safety First Home safety fire CO electrical water chemicals3 . DIYcraft hazards tool safety including protective clothing4 . Poisons Chemicals safe storage5 . Fire fire facts escape techniques6 .

Self Defense the law being arrested techniques animal attacks10 . Terrorism threats targets evacuation11 . Disasters natural disasters including earthquakes tsunami hurricane tornado flood lighting and drought emergency supplies12 . Health childhood diseases parasites life saving techniquesAlso note that this is a UK book and it uses British terms . For instance what is called the boot of a car in the UK is the trunk in the US . The electrical plugs are also those of the UK and the voltage is 220 rather than 110 in the US . However these differences are minor and I do not feel limit the use of the book for an American audience . I think that the least useful section for a US reader is the four pages devoted to the legal aspects of selfdefense as this applies to the laws of the UK . While generally applicable to the US the specifics are different and differ somewhat from US state to state.All in all I liked this book but much of the information is just common sense and well known by almost everyone . However there is so much information in the book that most people should find some interesting new material . I found the book to be useful for everyday hazards and to be a good reference source . However covering the breath of topics that it does it does not go very deeply into any one of them . Furthermore there is no bibliography there are no references to sources where additional information can be gathered and the book lacks an index . This and the general common sense nature of much of the material made this a fourstar rather than a fivestar book for me . Those looking for more detailed information of any of the topics covered in the book may be disappointed and would therefore rate it lower . ",3

"The author went to Burma already with his mind made up things were bad and he was going to see more bad things and talk to people with bad experiences and have bad experiences himself and have a thoroughly miserable time the whole time he was there . And he managed to do just that . In no way at all was his writing beautiful or poetic . But he managed to miss the beautiful and poetic side of the amazing Burmese people in the country he visited . Not a good introduction to this muchmisunderstood country or the resilient people who live there . ",1
"I was captivated by the book from the first story to the end . Ni Ni 's short life was a snapshot of the helplessness courage and tragedy of the Burmese people under the rule of a brutal corrupt and repressive regime . The search of an old basket weaved the stories and observations very nicely together . It was quietly powerful a nonprovocative dignified and compassionate account of Burma . Throughout the book I felt anger sadness admiration and humbleness . I was charmed by the generosity friendliness sincerity warmth hospitality honesty dignity and courage of the people . I wish the tourists and merchants could show more consideration and respect to Burmese people culture resources environment and heritage . We would be no better than the foreigner who used Ni Ni and discarded her after use who took without caring what he took away . The nation deserves better and this book helps us to understand its plight and hope . ",4
"This book is indisputably well written . But it taught me nothing about Burma I did n't already know and it was rather dull in much of the book . The author uses small stories about different characters to tell the story of Burma 's recent history and repressive practices but the stories just are n't that interesting in many cases . Captivating this book is not . I did n't find it to be travel literature or politically informative and as fiction it was concise but lackluster.Paul ",2
"This book taught me more than I could dream it would . The writing especially the character development is on power with Hemingway .

"If 'The History of Celtic Britain and Ireland ' is at all of interest to you then I highly recommend this book . The author has got a real feel for the subject . Sometimes you are along with him on a journey into areas of Celtic history where he travels to get the personal feel of the place . It is not a dry read at all quite the opposite real humor grief other emotions are communicated a magical experience at times . Sometimes the thread of the story takes the reader from ancient times now the 18th century now again in prehistory . I do not mind that actually but some might not get why the author finds that kind of narration necessary . I read just before this book Arthur and the Lost Kingdoms and I did not expect as much repetition from that book in The Sea Kingdoms as I found it is not entire chapters used over but simply some illustrations never much more that a paragraph of material and always reworded a little . To summarize I find this to be an excellent history as its title promises with some ideosyncrasies that are not a big hurdle for an interested reader . ",3
"My third book by this author . A happy and sad book about English genocide against the Celtic peoples and the beautiful differences and commonalities amongst the Celtic nations who were made foreigners by the sais in their own countries . Remarkable book . If you have a drop of Celtic blood in you this must be read . ",4
"This is an excellent survey history of Celtic Britain focusing as the author said on the people who already lived there when the Romans arrived . It is not the standard narrative structure rather a series of themed narratives based on specific aspects of the Welsh Scots and Irish . With some fun side trips to Cornwall and Man . There are some fun facts and interesting Celtic spin put on the events I learned about in school from the Anglosphere POV . It 's a good chatty history that should appeal to Celticbackground readers on both sides of the Atlantic who are not ready for weighty scholarly research.My only complaint is that I have read two other books Mr. Moffat published at a later date Border Reivers The Faded Map and he cribbed sections from this one into those to fill them instead of producing new material . So some of the information and anecdotes here were redundant although they fitted in well enough here . For a firsttime reader for Mr Moffat 's work I reccommend starting with this one then moving on to the more regionally specific works . ",3
"I found this to be a completely enjoyable survey of history from the Celtic perspective . I suppose some might call it revisionist but then it is demonstrated in the book that it is the history written by the conquerors that is truly revisionist . Do not get the impression that this is an over glorification of some mythohistoric Celtic past for the author shows little tolerance for the fuzzyminded romantic inventions of the revived Druid orders Sir Walter Scott and the New Agers . This is an accurate assessment of the actual Celtic past and it is quite fascinating enough.The book starts with the dream time back before the Romans . Around 1000 B.C . the Celts burst out of their homeland north of the Alps . Indeed it is shown how the Celtic tribes ranged from the British Isles to the Iberian Peninsula to southern Poland to central Turkey usually on horseback . This is reflected in place names even to the current day the names of the rivers Danube Rhine and Rhone are all of Celtic origin . Even Gallipoli means city of the Celts . The Celts were the first masters of Europe they even sacked Rome in 390 B.C . In fact considering that the heyday of Celtic culture was so long ago it is remarkable that their culture and identity has survived at all into modern times.However the central focus of the book is the British Isles . The author actually walked drove and sailed the region to get a feel for what survives of a distinct Celtic heritage and especially the Gaelic language . This was necessary since standard AngloSaxon histories tend to distort minimize or ignore the fact that Celts once ruled the British Isles . The conqueror 's perspective was land based . The Celtic perspective was from the sea . In fact one quickly sees that far from being pushed to isolated remote strongholds the native Britons were actually quite effectively linked by the sea from the Lords of the Isles in the Hebrides to the Isle of Man to Wales to Cornwall to Ireland all were so interconnected as to be positively cosmopolitan in comparison to the inland kingdoms of the Saxons . It even seems that it was Irish or CeltoViking voyagers that discovered and first colonized Iceland and possibly first discovered the New World.There is just so much fascinating information from the Scots settlement of Scotland from Ireland to how the Irish saved Christianity and civilization in Western Europe during the Dark Ages to the various brutally crushed Celtic uprisings through history to present day remnants and the best place to experience them for yourself . This is a marvelous overview of history and I know if I ever make it across the sea I will have this book in my back pocket . ",4
"Alistair Moffat has produced in this work one of the most intriguing and informative history books I have read in some time covering the Celtic peoples history and traditions of Scotland Wales Ireland Cornwall and the Isle of Man and to a much lesser extent Brittany in northern France as well as of England itself . Too often the history of the British Isles is the history of the English and in this book he seeks to show an entire element of British history now largely forgotten.Very importantly Moffat defines just what the term Celtic means . Celts are not defined by their race or by their place of birth rather the Celts of Britain are a speech community . At one time an older version of Welsh was spoken all over the island of Britain and Irish Gaelic was the common tongue of Ireland they were both cousin languages sharing syntax and vocabulary though later becoming mutually unintelligible . The very language of the Celts has often been at the core of their identity from early times as the Celts have long believed that if their language fell from use that their nation whether Welsh Irish or other would from fade from history . The opponents of the Celts understood this and for centuries have attacked their language seeking to eliminate its use from government the courts churches and schools full well realizing that to fully dominate the Celts they had to be rid of their unifying and defining language . As the author summarizes the war for Britain was as much a war of words as of blood and steel.Celts were also linked by the sea hence the title of this book . For centuries the sea was a much better highway than land and once the ocean linked a Celtic community that stretched to mainland Europe including modern Portugal Spain and France . Indeed the sea was often the focus of much more effort than land with castles once constructed more to guard stretches of sea rather than areas of land and the powerful Lord of the Isles starting in the mid14th century ruling his Sea Kingdom from a movable court at sea with the islands of Islay and Tiree serving as an administrative center and granary respectively.Very often we see in this book that the story of the Celtic peoples is the story for the war for Britain . The Romans the AngloSaxons the Normans the English and the British won that war he writes a victory more or less complete by the end of the18th century . This is a history written by the victors too often the side of the losers was not told or improperly told aided by the fact that the Celts were largely a nonliterate though not illiterate culture greatly valuing oral tradition but for the most part not embracers of the written word . Indeed Moffat spends much time analyzing the English and modern view that only written sources should be valued and oral sources are automatically suspect a view that has cost the world a vast store of history culture and literature.The Celtic lands were by no means completely nonliterate in a striking paradox the Irish monks were noted producers of written material preserving much ancient Greek and Roman knowledge and literature that might have otherwise been lost . Indeed the saga of the Celtic and particularly Irish monks fills several fascinating chapters members of this group may have even visited North America prior to Columbus.Today the Celtic speech community is largely extinct . Cornish and Manx possess no native speakers the ancient words only on the lips of enthusiasts . Scots Gaelic will likely become extinct within a generation and Irish is in decline as well only Welsh shows any real strength . Efforts are being made to preserve the Celtic languages not out of any weird woolly quaint or daft dream of supplanting English but merely to seek to preserve ancient traditions and knowledge of Celtic history and culture . Language preservation is all the more important when one realizes that Celtic history often lacks obvious ruins with little to compare to say the Valley of the Kings or the Parthenon.Perhaps even more damaging Moffat writes is that Celtic history is in serious dangerous of being reduced to quaint local color and comfortable entertainment something more suited to the tourist trade and Hollywood than real history and unfortunately much Celtic history that is known to the public is a fairly recent invention . The Highland Clearances of the 19th century saw the removal of thousands from the Scottish Highlands leading to the myth much embraced by many from Victorian painters to modern filmmakers of the lonely windswept majestic wilderness that was an entirely artificial creation . The kilt most well known today is more properly called the feileadh beag or small kilt and is actually the creation of an 18th century English factory owner to aid employees in his ironworks even the word kilt is from the Danish kilte which means to tuck up . Even the tradition of identifying certain tartan patterns or setts with certain clan names dates largely back to a book published in 1842 that was largely madeup . The muchloved Welsh tradition of the Gorsedd a threeday convention of bards and druids was mostly made up by Edward Williams who later called himself Iolo Morgannwg a skilled 18th century Welsh scholar who created much of what is popularly thought of about bards and particularly the Druids though interweaving so much actual history rituals and literature that it has taken entire academic careers to distinguish fact from his fancy . Even when it became known that his and that of another proponent of druidism William Price culture never really existed as such many still embraced their efforts as part of a national Welsh revival and something decidedly unEnglish.A fascinating book covering many aspects of the Celts from the bold Border Reivers to the real Rob Roy to Irish nationalism to Cornish wrestling .

"Written from an American 's perspective this book was one of the most shocking exposes of the dreadful Soviet communist system that killed millions of its own people from its inception in 1917 . Dolgun shares from his heart and is brutally honest about everything that he did and that was done to him . I could n't put this book down and though it is long with small print I will read it again and again to remind myself of the power of the human spirit combined with God 's mercy can sustain a man in the most treacherous circumstances . This story is not for the faint of heartit will break your heart but also encourage you to never give up no matter how bleak life may be . AWESOME ! AWESOME ! AWESOME ! ",4
"Dolgun 's many years in the Soviet Gulag makes his story very unique . This book will change your life and your view of modern history ! An absolutely shocking and disheartening look into life in the Soviet Union before perestroika.This memoir and Varlam Shalamov 's book Kolyma Tales are the best books I have ever read about the Gulag ! ",4
"Dolgun 's tale has countless reviews giving it 5 stars and I concur . There is no need for me to give you a summary description . What I can add is that I have read countless gulag tales and this is one of the best . It is filled with lessons on survival . Dolgun was not a hero but he clearly was a survivor . My other gulag readings confirm that everything he endured rings true . The tale is both disturbing and enlightening . An American citizenemployee of the American Embassy is kidnapped by the KGB subjected to brutal torture sentenced to 25 years in the gulags and the US does virtually nothing to free him . Furthermore after he is freed from the gulags high US officials discouraged efforts by Dolgun 's sister to help him flee to the USA . The lesson to be learned here is that the USSR was the evil doer but incompetence and weakness on the part of US bureaucrats enabled that evil . ",4
"During a walk one day in Moscow NYCborn twentytwoyear old employee of the American Embassy in Moscow Alexander Dolgun was kidnapped and taken to the Lubyanka prison headquarters of the MGB . Initially thinking what a great tale he 'd have to tell having seen the inside of such a famous place knowing he had n't committed a crime he was unafraid maybe even a little bitexcited . But it was n't long before he was imprisoned interrogated tortured and sentenced under p 19 Article 58 sections 6 8 10 etc . of the Soviet Criminal Codeespionage political terrorism antiSoviet propaganda etc . etc . to imprisonment in a forced labor camp . By the time of the thaw when many prisoners were released including Dolgun he had spent eight year of his life in forced labor camps . Twentythree long years passed from the day of his kidnapping until he was able to again set foot on American soil . After his release from prison he met Solzhenitsyn who interviewed him while writing The Gulag Archipelago . He was especially interested in Dolgun because p 348 he had nevermet a sane survivor of Sukhanovka . Like Solzhenitsyn Dolgun had an amazing memory and was able to recall minute details of much of his imprisonment . Forced to stay up for days at a time with little or no sleep during his interrogation sessions he was beaten sent to solitary confinement and tortured for not signing a document stating that he had committed illegal acts . He proudly writes of his ability to survive without signing anything incriminating anyone else although some of his acquaintances did succumbed to the pressure . When he finally was released he found out that his mother also picked up tortured and imprisoned went mad due to her experience . Not long after their reunion she was sent to a psychiatric hospital with the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia . She remained there for the rest of her life . There were very few Americans in the GULAG . At times he was able to use that fact to his advantage although others were wary of him believing he must have been a spy.He recounts the experience of being transported to and between prisons interactions and friendships with other prisoners the day to day drudgery of trying to stay alive under horrendous conditions which involved trying to meet ridiculously high work quotas for extremely strenuous jobs while in a constant state of starvation and often sickness . Fortunately he was able to work in the prison hospital at times as a feldsher even performing minor surgery . He also did his share of hard labor but was ingenious enough to get extra food by secretly doing sideline work like by making metal spoons . Dolgun 's story is one of many wonderfully tragic memoirs about an oftenoverlooked issue Stalin 's forced labor camps . Also good Journey into the Whirlwind by Eugenia Semyonovna Ginzburg Man is Wolf to Man by Janusz Bardach One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich partially based on the experiences of Dolgun 's friend George Tenno and The Gulag Archipelago by Alexander Solzhenitsyn and probably my favorite Kolyma Tales by Varlam Shalomov .

"I enjoy the genre of adventure stories with a few exceptions . Most mountainclimbing books leave me numbly wondering why people are so stupid . That said I really enjoy these Man vs. World accounts . This book is the tale of an American kidnapped by the Soviets and held in Russia for years . His tale of the tortures he and his fellow prisoners endure will make you question how a man can survive so much with his sanity intact.Dolgun does a wonderful job portraying prison life and despair and how prisoners cope with horrific limitations . His accounts of the people and places he experienced in Russia are as penetrating as a Dostoyevsky or Dickens . If you 're interested in the Gulag this is a much more accessible work than any of those by Sozhenitsyn with the exception of One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich . That account is fictional this account is not.I note that you can buy a good used copy for a buck here on Amazon . Spend that buck and be amazed that this book did n't make anyone 's top 5 list of adventure stories . ",4
"How ironic that such a fascinating and important book is out of print and number 2.8 million on the Amazon best seller list . There have been many books on the Soviet Gulag but to my knowledge this is the only one about the experiences of an American who actually was imprisoned in the Gulag . The Soviet approach to oppressing people was far more diabolically sophisticated than that of the Nazis which was crude in comparison and who mainly relied on extermination camps mass killings and torture usually for the purpose of extracting information . While the Nazis were torturing their enemies the Soviets tortured pretty much anyone who fell into their hands whether friend or foe . They used violence too but their system also relied on psychological violence.It was not unusual for a prisoner who ended up in the Gulag to run across the very person who had interrogated them when they were arrested and who was now a prisoner too . Many of the prisoners were Red Army officers who had distinguished themselves in battle but now Stalin was concerned they had seen too much of how other countries lived.When Dolgun was first picked up on the streets of Moscow he was taken to the notorious Lubianka prison . One of his captors opened a small door to a tiny chamber smaller than a phone booth and impossible to stand up in and shoved Dolgun inside without a word of how long he might remain there . Prisoners were issued prison clothes that included hugely oversized trousers with no belt . It was not possible to walk without one hand holding up the trousers . The Soviets rightly believed this would deter escapes . This book is filled with this kind of detail.Not only is this book an upclose look at Stalinism at its worst but it 's a magnificent story of survival on the part of Dolgun . Many of the inmates of the Gulag were not there for politics but for being members of the substantial Soviet criminal underworld . Dolgun is fortunate to be befriended by this group and gives us a fascinating picture of criminal society within the Gulag.There is so much more to this book but I 'll leave that for the reader to discover . You do n't need knowledge of history politics or the Soviet Union to enjoy this book . It 's a window into the extreme paranoia of the USSR a paranoia that flowed directly from the Emperor of paranoia Joseph Stalin . ",4
"The book hits you like a slap to the face . Right from page 1 . Some of the ordeals Alexander Dolgun goes through are mind boggling.Beyond the story of a man who endures everything I also enjoyed the narrative on the internal problems of the Soviet communist system . Whereas most of my knowledge of the USSR is based on the American Media this book put a face and a heart around cold war russians.The book began to drag near then end but overall an amazing book . I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Survival simple torture and ColdWar Russia . ",3
"I chose to read this book after reading the written review by Stuart Paine . I thought that any book that made a man cry must be extraordinary and I was right . The things we were taught in college about Russian History pales in comparison to the writings of Mr. Dolgun . I was appalled at the conditions in the Gulag that he wrote of and amazed at the ways in which the prisoners managed to maintain their sanity and faith . This is a must read for any thinking person . ",4
"I read this book as a classroom assignment in my senior year of high school in 1979 and it left a profound impression on me . I think it should be required reading for teens . After reading this book I have NEVER taken freedom for granted . ",4
"The book looks more like a proof of a concept writing a novel without a single E than anything else . Georges Perec was also fond of creating rebuses and crossword puzzles and this book looks like one of those . It gives no more emotional pleasure than solving crossword in the morning newspaper although one can be proud if the crossword was difficult . Well this one probably was but there is nothing more than a coldy executed technique of a brilliant author . One crucial ingredient heart appears to be missing not just a certain vowel . The book can be admired but liked ? Probably not ",3
"Six plus six plus four months ago I bought a book A Void . Originally an author G. Prc first thought of A Void or La Disparition in 1967 . In 1994 it was brought out from a country at a north Atlantic location in which Franais is usually a normal way of articulating in writing and out loud and into a form of communication which most inhabitants of this country US of A know . This translator was a Mr. Adair . This book is a highly fantastic book . A linguistic madman who thought it up was choosing to put A Void on papyrus without a symbol in a form of communication this missing fifth symbol . This author or madman was brilliant and did it without any faults as did translator Adair . Why ? I do n't know . Author was crazy as a fox is crazy.In this book this Void I found no lack of things for stimulation of my mind . In fact Void is not a void at all . Pagination # 104 ` Twas upon a midnight tristful I sat poring wan and wistfulThrough many a quant and curious listful of my consorts slain.Aha ! you shout out not vocalizing too loudly I wish that 's a translation of an 18stanza rhyming story byBut I can not put to papyrus what you shout . I can though say that A Void lists author of rhyming as Arthur Gordon Pym thus naming a man from a work that this actual author did not finish . Two or 3 of a group would say this man was too full of phobia at his own construction & agrave la an individual of physics biology and so on in Mary 's horror story about a monstrous guy known as Frank in a commondrinkingglass I ask your pardon for this bad pun .

"Whatever happened to the French novel ? There was the immediate postwar era when once could read Camus Sartre 's postNausea novels the rise of Jean Genet . But in the fifties and sixties the nouveau roman developed which in the hands of RobbeGillet Sarraute and Butor sought to deconstruct the possibilities of fictions and which in the hands of such writers as RobbeGillet Sarraute and Butor . The result was very complex and subtle and elaborate with much on the ontological significance of the novel . But it was not the sort of fiction that people liked to read and it left most English speaking critics very cold . The late Georges Perec was connected to this sort of school and at least one intelligent English critic has thought that Perec wrote some of the most boring novels of the twentieth century . This book however is manifestly not one of them . Indeed it 's a remarkable hoot at times quite funny and throughout consistently ingenious and clever . What Perec has written is a lipogram a book which follows a special grammatical rule . In this case there are no es in the entire work . Writing such a book is incredibly difficult and translating it into another language would appear to be impossible . Fortunately this is not the case as Gilbert Adair has demonstrably shown . There has been at least one lipogram in English that includes no e and the unimaginative writer when he wished to have his characters talk only used said . Adair rather helpfully prefers to use the present tense . Certain words in French such as juif mort and Amour have to be replaced with unusual English equivalents.The result is an incredibly strange novel . At times the sentences are full of proper nouns that exist for no purpose than their eless nature . At other times the necessary twists and turns are odd and unusual and the result feels like you are reading a book of palindromes . Another Perec specialty and he wrote the longest ever 5000 words long . But more often there are brilliant flights of baroque fancy such as the dinner Augustus Clifford prepares for his unfortunate guests on p. 115 . The plot starts with France in chaos and an insomniac critic Anton Vowl who goes missing . His friends find strange notes and letters . They find his lipogramatic versions of Edgar Allen Poe 's The Raven Shelley 's Ozymandias and Vowl 's version of the most famous soliliquoy in English Living or not Living that is what I ask . But gradually a plot begins to develop in a way worthy of A Manuscript found in Saragossa.Can Vowl 's friends find out who or what is behind the strange deaths and disappearances ? Who stabbed an Arab solicitor who smoked a cigar in a zoo and then absconded with his corpse ? What is the secret of the strange rubylike zahir that brings death to those who mention it ? What secret does a carp named Jonah carry within himself ? Why does Clifford 's son Douglas Haig die a horrible death while dressed as the murdered father in Mozart 's Don Giovanni ? Why is one of the chapters missing ? There is an especially vicious Albanian brigand who who we learn long after his death has been particularly humiliated along with the lust of his life . But there are important moral lessons as well . The novel agrees with Jefferson and Danton that primogeniture is a really really bad idea . Also there are certain perversions that one should never undertake especially when your brother is trying to dynamite you . And why is the French title of the work the same as the certificates the Vichy regime gave to those inquiring about those deported to Auchwitz one of those being Perec 's mother ? There are strange secret baths the most incredible revelations the oddest connections between the characters are revealed and wealthy Ottomans who are turned into peanut butter sundaes . There is deliberate anachronism and the solution is not entirely coherent . But be aware that the villian is not among the characters who in the course of the novel attempt or succeed at murder and manslaughter . As a novel A Void is not at the height of Calvino and Garcia Marquez who provide love compassion and hope to their magical games . But this is a better novel than Pale Fire and comparable to Borges and Pavic a Faberge Egg novel in which something nasty ticks . ",4

"The gimmick of this book and its translation is that it does n't use the letter ' e ' anywhere in the story . To make up for that the writer uses 3 or 4 words to describe what a single word containing the letter ' e ' would have described succinctly and more adequately . So the book is a jumbled mass of text that is difficult to read and even more difficult to care about the story or the characters . I got through 30 pages before I stopped reading . It was hard to go from reading Atonement by Ian McEwan to this frivolous mess of a book . Worst part was it took 2 weeks to arrive from an overseas book seller and the wait was not worth it . I almost gave this book as a Christmas present got lucky I decided against it even before trying to read it . ",0
"In little less then 24 hours the 16thcentury young Lady Dacre arrives at the castle she has inherited on the ScotsEnglish border compels a wandering stranger to defend her tenants against roving brigands falls for him almost and watches him leave.Although this sounds like a bodiceripper romance it 's rather the opposite a fierce violent even macho story of the terribly violent world of the Border Counties of the 16th century told in an authentic dialect by Father Luis a retainer of the Dacre family.McDonaldFraser 's novella barely 150 pages is remarkable for its economy within a few paragraphs we have the main characters compellingly described and developed within a few pages Waitabout the stranger who defends her has dashed off to save the village within a chapter or two a terrible violent battle has erupted . The pace is breathtaking but not at the expense of fully realized characters.I will say though that the archaic Scottish dialect is not easy going at first stick with it though if you get in 10 pages you will not be able to put it down !

"This is a fine work of historical research and theological analysis that also happens to be a great love story too . It 's the love story that keeps the reader slogging through the mud of the former two quite an accomplishment .

"Dynamite read . Not long enough . I wanted more of these amazing characters and more story . None the less if the reiver is something that interests you as it does me then read Fraser here and enjoy . ",4
"I enjoyed the story very much however I have been reading a lot about the Borders and Reivers and am interested in the period . My Father found the action slow in coming and ended up setting it aside in favor of a good western . I have to agree that the action was a bit sparse but I enjoyed the fleshing out of the characters and the weaving of the backdrop . I look forward to reading more of his writing . ",3
"Being a George MacDonald Fraser fan I have exhausted his works and have not found his equal for historically based hijinks . Follow Candlemass Road with the really wild The Reavers and you will be well versed in the times and temperament of the Borders but be prepared to laugh heartedly with the Reavers . ",4
"I have read a lot of novels in my life . This is one of the best . It is a different type of book but it details a simple story which illustrates human nature . All of the readers who asked that Fraser finish his story which resulted in a slapstick followup which I pretend does not exist are just unwilling to accept a realistic ending to what is a near perfect story . I have a copy of the first edition in hardcover and it is not a book that I will lend.I like the Flashman novels and Quartered Safe Out Here is excellent but I think this book is Fraser 's masterpiece . If you like historical fiction then this is a must read . ",4
"George MacDonald Fraser is the best of the Border historians . It as if he had ridden with the Reivers in their heyday . His fiction is every bit as compelling . I have a library copy of this book which had been given to me as a gift because of the prominence of the Border Reivers in my own historical fiction . I wanted a clean copy for my special librarywithout tobacco stains and who knows what and this is it . ",4
"Well you should read this . I 'm curious how it never got much of a play in the USA but then his brilliant memoir of WW II Quartered Safe Out Here was missed too . Like some other positive reviewers I would have liked a different ending but this is n't Captain Blood . Read it and wonder . It 's quite remarkable . ",4
"There really is no feeling like that of picking up an asyetunread novel by George MacDonald Fraser . It is one of delicious certainty you will be entertained you will be informed and you will be charmed . Unfortunately I can only expect to have this experience a couple of more times in my life as there just is n't that much left of his that I have n't read anymore . Alas alas alas.The locale in this one is the wild EnglishScottish borderlands in 1598 . Although England was mostly settled and Scotland was mostly settled the midlandsunder the jurisdiction of neitherwere not and bands of thieves and brigandsreiversroamed about terrorizing the countryside.For characters there is Luis Guevara the teller of the tale and the meek priest of the Dacre estate located in the middle of these badlands there is Lord Ralph Dacre the whitehaired crimsonclad Red Bull Lord of the Estate and scourge of the thieves there is Lady Margaret Dacre sharpwitted firebreathing and newly come to the estate after the untimely death of her father and there is finally Archie Noble Waitabout a broken man thief and he who proved to be the Great Lady 's protector.For plot there is the death of the Red Bull shot . . . through with calivers nine balls in his body and he let die by the roadside . Lady Margaret bred in courtly London comes to the estate and on the date of her arrival finds that the thieves are already attempting to reinstitute their filthy blackmail on her timid villagers . Those charged with helping her find excuses not to for various reasons but primarily because of their unstated fear of the dreaded Nixon clan . She turns to the imprisoned Waitabout who in exchange for his life agrees to go to the village and defend it.For language there is the incomparable GMF this time using the lingo of an educated Scot of the 16th Century duplicating the feat of his bravura linguistic performance in Black Ajax . And there is his descriptive power here the narrator 's first view of the village A sorry pack they were the menfolk stout enough but dirty and illclad the women as slatternly as I ever saw and if there were three pairs of shoon among them it was enough.And the description of the battle itself enough to make your blood run cold There was a great commotion about the bearded Nixon him that was the leader and called Ill Will and they tugged him all ways some saying he should hang and others for having at him with their blades . . . they dragged him to the great dunghill that lay beside the cattle pen and there heaved him up and drave him down head foremost into the filth and held him there.There you have it another great GMF novel this one without the romantic playfulness of the Flashman novels but still with the driving narrative expert use of the language and superb research . You can not go wrong with this author . He has easily reached the stature of his heroes Stevenson Doyle Sabatini and Dumas . Indeed he may stand above them . ",4
"Do n't expect an amusing romp & agrave la Flashman with this compelling novella . Told by an elderly Catholic priest many years after the event it 's a dark and bitter tale about the triumph of pride and ruthless expediency over honour and moral precepts.Only one law applies in the AngloScottish borderlands of the C16th the Law of the Marches meaning might is right . Raids and random brutal violence are a way of life and a constant sense of fear and trepidation prevails among both Scottish and English settlers.Sir Ralph Red Bull Dacre ironfisted ruler of the estate of Askerton in Cumberland for many years has been ambushed and killed.His heiress the young Lady Margaret arrives to find her father 's retainers dispersed and her inheritance under imminent threat from Scottish reivers . Beautiful but devious arrogant and not used to having her will thwarted Margaret is a true daughter of the Border and prepared to use any means to hold her lands.The means are at hand in the person of the versatile rogue Archie Noble currently being held prisoner in her cellars on a charge of thievery . She offers him a choice a speedy hanging from a nearby chestnut tree or to lead a forlorn hope counterattack upon the expected invaders in which case she will stand surety against the consequences.Not surprisingly he takes the latter option and succeeds beyond expectation but then the lady makes a further offerThe abrupt ending mirrors the reader 's gasp of stunned disbelief at a final shocking betrayal of trust and adds impact to a powerful and memorable little story .

"Towards the end of his life George McDonald Fraser wrote this memoir of his experiences as a very young man fighting in the last battles of the Burma campaign . He acknowledges the unreliablity of his memory the result not of age but of being a young private later a lance corporal in the chaos of war . His memory of contacts with the enemy in battle is very clear he writes but he needed to refer to regimental histories in order to make sense of these memories in the broader narrative of the campaign something to which he would never have been privy at the time.The result is a remarkable book funny exciting and moving by turns as he recounts his life in Nine Section a Scot in the midst of Cumbrians . He remained to the end of his life he notes a man of his times a product of imperial Britain unforgiving of the Japanese the repeated use of the term Jap drives home this point and unapologetic of these facts . His honesty about this and about how the war was fought is an important aspect of the book fundamental to presenting a clear sighted but affectionate portrait of the sort of men who served . Paradoxically this also leads to points where he rails against aspects of the modern world European Union and a perceived softness on criminals for example perhaps honest about what he felt but unlike the rest of the book little to do with considered experience.These quibbles aside this is an exceptional book beautifully written and a fine tribute to the men Fraser served with and the generation who defeated European fascism and Japanese militarism .

"George MacDonald Fraser 's memoir of his service as an enlisted man in the Black Cat Division in the Burma Campaign . Written forty years after the fact in the 80s Fraser vividly describes the experience of fighting the Jap in Burma by all accounts the worst theater in WWII . The book as everything in places it is laugh out loud funny and in others you might have trouble seeing the print because of the dampness of your eyes.Fraser has the remarkable ability to make us feel like we know the other members of his squad . When I finished the book I began to miss Nixon Grand Arse and the others.Keegan described Quartered Safe Out Here as one of the great personal memoirs of the Second World War all I 've got to say is One of ? ha it is the best at least the best I 've read . ",4
"A good firsthand account of a man 's experience with the British infantry in Burma near the end of the war . It is marred not by the casual racism of the day encountered in the course of the story but by the author 's apparent endorsement of its perseverance into today . An additional problem is the author 's incessant petulant whining about how much young people today petulantly whine allegedly encouraged by a wimpy press and overindulgent parents teachers and psychologists . ",2
"Fraser 's is one of the finest war memoirs I 've ever read and for so many reasons . He has a gift for illustrating the life of the combat soldier in ways that are at once terrifying hilarious and sometimes just plain bizarre . His discovery in the field that he had a gift for brewing tea is unforgettable as is his account of falling down a well in the middle of a battle his comrades cracking jokes about it as the chaos and noise of battle rages all around them . Among the most remarkable things about Fraser 's book are his comparisons between the official histories of what happened with what he actually experienced the official history of one engagement for example records only that a tank was destroyed and so many men killed or wounded on each side but Fraser describes what that burning tank SMELLED like and how it attracted the attention of Japanese soldiers throughout the night . These are the things we rarely get from ordinary histories of battles and wars . His book does not reduce the soldiers to a list of statistics . One learns to care about them or loathe them almost as much as Fraser did.The final few chapters are particularly sobering . We owe so much to the men and women who fought and served in this war . Fraser 's book has many important and enduring lessons for all of us but particularly for those of us born in the postwar boom . Highly highly recommended ! ",4
"Before Fraser became well known for his Flashman series of comic historical novels he was an enlisted man in the 17th Division of the 14th Indian Army during WWII . Almost 50 years later he recounts his wartime experience in Burma from the perspective of his section of about eight or so men all from Cumbria in NW England . With his many writerly gifts he gives a mostly unvarnished account of what he did and saw capturing battle actions and anecdotes with sharp and often witty prose.Fraser 's account is very much a personal one and throughout the book he rails against contemporary mores and broader political correctness concerning the war . He is quite open about how the British forces believed themselves to be superior beings compared to the Japanese they foughtand points to Japanese POW camps as a vindication of this . Similarly he reports the campfire discussions after his unit saw newsreels from liberated concentration camps in which all agreed that Germany needed to be razed to the ground . Fraser himself provides an emphatic defense of the use of nuclear bombs on Japan . And in his defense it is true that the latest scholarship on the subject is in agreement that Japan was not on the brink of surrender at the time.Beyond these larger issues the memoir is perhaps at its best when telling the smaller stories . The character of his Cumbrian comrades the descriptions of various native units such as the Gurkhas Pathans Sikhs and especially a hilarious description of the Army 's East African drivers . There 's a great bit where he falls down a well in the middle of an attack and another great part where an uneducated Sergeant borrows his copy of Shakespeare 's Henry V and definitively concludes that Shakespeare had been a soldier . My favorite bit though was when he is sent to teach the PIAT British version of the bazooka to a guerilla unit led by a character straight out of Monty Python . Cpt . Grief was one of those crazy commandotype officers who spoke in a running rah rah style thought that war was great fun and was totally deadly.Although at times Fraser 's conservative crankiness gets old and at times his slips into oversentimentality its kind of hard to begrudge him those faultshaving done his service he 's earned the right to grumble . Overall the memoir is a great taste of the forgotten war in Asia and an excellent example of the infantrymanlevel view of the war . ",3
"Mildly interesting memoir of Burma in WW II but I would call it more of a character study of members of the author 's unit than a harrowing tale . If you do n't expect a lot you 'll probably find it okay but I kept waiting for the good parts . They are n't there it 's just the same old same old all the way through . ",2
"This is a lively account of the author 's wartime experience in Burma . His depiction of the characters and action are vivid and engaging while capturing the essence of Army life for a young enlisted man at the front . The description of the Gurkhas alone is worth the price of the book . The author and his fellow soldiers deserve a heartfelt salute ! ",4
"This is not your so called war stories . It is about a man and the men he served with without any liberal gibberish see his references to more modern timesand the fact that wars happen and will happen just or unjust depending on one 's views . But they wo n't go away like some Utopian dreamers think just because other Utopians were n't up to it . There were so many pages that hit me in the gut because one could so readily identify with things on the page . I never expected such a great book from a journalist media person which proves that there is good in every crowd . I salute Fraser and I wish I could tell him so in person . ",4
"This is an outstanding true story of the Burma war with none of the malarky that passes for reporting these days . The author does not excuse or whitewash Jap as he calls him and does not engage in soulsearching about tactics used to defeat a brutal enemy . When compared to the allout determination of the entire British and American nation to win the neartreasonous undercutting of their own country since the end of WW II by Liberals of all stripes becomes even more despicable . This is a fine story of the bravery and confusion of war from the foot soldier 's point of view . ",4
"I agree with the reviews below that the autobiographical portions of QUARTERED SAFE OUT HERE constitute an outstanding memoir of the jungle fighting in Burma . Fraser excels at capturing the nuances of daytoday existence in an extraordinary situation . I loved the way he recreates the regional dialect of his fellow soldiers enumerates the items in his backpack and describes the combat as a matteroffact exhausting business of sights sounds and smells which culminates in the deaths of a few British soldiers and a great many more Japanese.My reservations come because of the passages devoted to lambasting what Fraser sees as politically correct postwar critics . These make up perhaps only 5 % of the overall narrative but they recur regularly and I think they 're too much . In them Fraser clearly has an axe to grind . He stops being the delightfully ambiguous author of the Flashman books who realizes that his protagonist is simultaneously a coward and a hero . Instead he 's grumpy grandpa snarking through a holiday party about the inlaws he does n't like . It 's a letdown . The book would have been better had he downplayed or deleted those portions because the combat narrative is strong enough to stand on its own and make its own points the way E.B . Sledge 's gutchurning descriptions of Peleliu and Okinawa in WITH THE OLD BREED stand on their own.I love the Flashman books and I 'm very fond of 95 % of QUARTERED SAFE OUT HERE . But the denunciations flaw the book.I write this by the way as the son of a Pacific war veteran who never forgave the Japanese either . But somehow Dad managed not to interrupt his war stories to unload on modern critics . I wish Fraser had done likewise . ",3
"If you wish to understand the common British soldier in World War II his virtues and his vices this book is essential . In spare prose the author a celebrated novelist recalls his service in Burma as an enlisted man in the British Army . As he conjures up his long ago comrades their marches the food they ate their fights with the enemy and each other the reader gains much needed insight into a world that is rapidly slipping from living memory . A fitting tribute to the tough British Tommies who did more than their share in rescuing the world from the evil of the Axis in World War II . Funny exciting moving this is a book that I predict will join the ranks of other classic military memoirs such as Graves ' Goodbye To All That . For an added treat read this book in tandem with Field Marshal Slim 's memoir Defeat Into Victory . ",4
"I too wrote a book about a war some 40 years after the event but I did n't come close to capturing the experience as well as GMF . Attitudes change about the need to fight wars but the hard memories never fade among those who were there . Feeling sorry for old soldiers one generation to another does n't mean much to us old sods.I have a very hard time reacting positively when I hear thank you for your service because I have no idea what it means.Still I share a perpetual bond with comrades I remember in filthy uniforms stained with blood and sweat clinging to an M16 held together with tape . I remember them all even if some were n't very likeable . All are easy to love.This book puts competitors like Red Badge of Courage to shame . ",4
"Fraser was is gone but he left us this gem . His time during the war battling the Japanese in Burma . He makes incredible and sadly true correlations between the neo liberal now and then back in the 1940s . Please read this book and know what life was like and how times have changed and maybe not for the best . This is not to say this is a sad story it 's not but is a fantastic read . ",4
"I 've been a fan of G. M. Fraser since the 1970s and I was not at all disappointed by this superb memoir of his experiences as a soldier in the British Army in Burma at the tail end of WWII . Fraser a historian as well as a novelist brings color and emotion to this story making you feel as if you are right beside him in battle . His unit saw relatively little action and much of the book is devoted to descriptions equipment and clothing military history and humorous anecdotes but all of it is told in Fraser 's charming eloquent and very funny style that of a grandfather regaling the tots in front of a fire brandy and cheroot in hand . Among other talents Fraser is a master of dialect portraying the Cumberland English of his comrades as well as a few other accents . The book is not all humor though Fraser describes killing enemies and watching friends die in battle and he pontificates at length on war soldiering and how views have changed during the passing decades . While you may not agree with some of his opinions I do n't it is enjoyable to read and thoughtprovoking without being annoying . I came away from it feeling as though I had been there and had made a friend . Sad to say Fraser died in 2009 and the final pages of the book have the finality of a man closing out the last chapter of his life . Altogether a fascinating book . ",4
"This book gives a wellwritten account of the British army fighting the Japanese in Burma . His descriptions of things like close combat night patrols and fighting in tropical weather are vivid . It 's a good exposition of a corner of WWII that the historians particularly American ones seem to have largely overlooked . ",3
"George MacDonald Fraser who has written many successful fiction books based on well researched history quite often starring his very British Flashman character writes a chronicle of his own personal experiences in the final stages of WWII fighting the Japanese as a 19 year old member of a rifle company that is composed of a handful of men run by a sergeant and a corporal . Fraser who just recently passed away writes of his first hand experiences in a very descriptive personal way capturing the various English dialects of his fellow citizen soldiers expressing all their frustrations of life in harsh conditions in the jungle dealing with swamps leaches mosquitoes questionable orders but generally good leadership although sometimes well questioned by the troops . Fraser gives you an excellent description of what it was like in the field mixed with the real humor from the men who bonded close together although having their differences with occasional culture clashes they generally endure their punishment with a delightful sarcasm . And Fraser gives you the full flavor of the different troops in the field such as the courageous Gurkha soldiers Indians and native tribesmen that fight with the British while also interacting with the tribes inhabiting the Burma jungles often caught between the two sides . Fraser does not write a political correct book and he is quite clear about that which makes the book a realistic read he echoes what the troops in the field really felt and he makes no bones how they felt about their enemy . An excellent picture of very young and veteran soldiers in the field that gives you the feel for the tremendous challenges and conditions they faced . ",4
"This is just a peach of a book about the war in Burma and the swan song of the Old Army of the British Raj . The author who wrote the outstanding Flashman series of novels does just as well here . The only Ironic thing is the cover of the book . Which shows the American General & West Pointer Vinegar Joe Stillwell walking out of Burma with his staff after the Japanese Conquest of Burma . ",4
"It is difficult to write a review of a man 's heart felt narrative of his experiences during combat . I can simply say that it is truly worth reading . ",4
"Fraser has a superb facility with words his Flashman series including The American with Flashman in his stilllecherous dotage is certainly one of the greatest set of historical military fiction . Quartered Safe Out Here shares the same fine qualities as the Flashman booksdrama humor and heroism which in Flashman 's case was almost invariably accidental or at least reluctantly unintended . This is a very personal account you 're not going to get great battles and sweeping victories . His section was 10 men including himself as a 19yearold private albeit a private who had several times been promoted then demoted back to private . The section is mostly Cumbrian Fraser from across the Scottish border is a bit of an alien . The heavy Cumbrian accent takes getting used to but Fraser translates with numerous footnotes and the accent actually becomes delightfully endearing.The Burma Campaign is seen through Fraser 's eyes . He does writing many years after the events have the Official History and he tries to reconcile his memory of things with the Official History . At times he 's right and the OH is wrong . So you get a sharply narrow view of what 's going on unlike say Field Marshall Slim 's account Defeat Into Victory where the larger view is at hand . Fraser 's world is his section with his wonderfullydrawn mates Grandarse not his real name and others . Fraser describes his own feelings and uncertainties . Contact with the Japanese was usually sparse but at times took on a frighteningly close immediacy confronting enemy soldiers just a few feet away . Contact with allies was less sparse but there was never the big picture everything was very local . Privates followed orders and did n't need to see the larger view unlike officers . Lieutenants and up even sergeants for that matter needed to be aware of other platoons companies divisions . It 's an effective view and very poignant.If you want a history of the Burma Campaign try Slim or a similar book . But if you want a very personal very upfront account you will appreciate this superb memoir . ",4
"I had frist read the Authors novels about that cad Flashman & was immediately hooked on his great writing skills and historical research . I just wish that I could write 110 as well as he.Then I have discovered this gem of a book about his time in the 14th Army fighting the Japanese in Burma during War Two as a young enlisted man . It is just marvelous in that it gives one the feeling of the grit heat dirt and loss of war without drowning one in self pity while being in the Border Regiment.This book is one of the best war story of a British Tommy that I have ever read . The book is well worth the time and coin ! ",4
"The author while beautifully detailing a forgotten war in Burma during WWII captures the essence of small unit fighting . Anyone who leads men in combat must read this book to better appreciate why loyalty down and personal courage matter . ",4
"A frank and totally absorbing account of Britain 's WWII Burma campaign from the perspective of a buck private and later lance corporal . Although this was essentially a side show to the war the fear the terror the privations the ferocity of fighting were as great here as in any theaterand are very convincingly described.Fraser 's skill as a writer he is the author of the Flashman series and a serious history of the ScotchEnglish border strife is abundantly on display this book is a real page turner . In fact I enjoyed it so much I immediately ordered those Fraser books I do n't already own . ",4
"I happened by chance to come across this book when searching for the Flashman series which I 'm reading now . I have read many nonfiction accounts of war from WWI to Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom . The WWII European theater of operations usually trumps the Pacific and only in the last few years have I started to delve into this area . Recommended books are Rising Sun and The Rape of Nanking.The Burma campaign is not as well documented and this is a welcome book to the canon.This book although not perhaps a classic is incredibly diverse and true to life . The one overriding issue for me was the writing in the vernacular of the British soldiers including Scots . For an American it is difficult to translate what 's written into coherent meaning at times . For the most part I was able to do so however there were some passages that I simply read over not knowing exactly was said even in context.This perhaps is a minor drawback but it does make it more real.I highly recommend this book particularly for lovers of true war stories .

"Most of you know GMF from his Flashman series . A few will have ventured into the McAuslan triology and from those tales gathered that Mr. Fraser is a WWII vet . Well this is his war memoir and a more sobering tale of battle sacrifice and stonewilled perseverance you will not find . I could go on at length about the plethora of merits this book contains but I 'll pause to mention just one . Quartered Safe dares to talk about the racism of war in politically incorrect terms and explain why so many veterans of the Pacific War came away with a hatred of the Japanese that was not easily quenched . This is rough stuff and it should be required reading for all Baby Boomers through Gen X'ers . ",4

"Though Fraser wrote this personal memoir of the Burma campaign decades after the war it is fresh direct and frank . This is one of the standout memoirs of the Second World War one of the best by an ordinary soldier . The Burma campaign never got the same attention as the fighting in Europe and the Pacific . Fraser tells us why the victory of the British 14th Army under General Slim under arduous conditions in the jungle was just as heroic . A Scot in The Border Regiment his rendering of conversations in Cumbrian dialect are more than engaging here and there you 'll laugh out loud . For Americans who tend to think only of Brits getting a feel for men from the different regions of Great Britain is an agreeable dimension of this book . So too is his respect for the Gurkhas and the soldiers of the Indian Army . Anyone thinking through the issues related to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki needs to read Fraser 's view from the infantry . He challenged sentimental or lazy thinking on how the war might better have unfolded without the shock of the bombs.Tip If you have a choice buy the second edition of this book which includes a chapter on the celebration of VJ+50 by the men of his old regiment and their families . It will tug your heart.30 ",4
"Americans are not given many opporutnities to see WWII from a Tommie point of view If you do not know what a Tommie is this book is not for you . I picked up interesting nuggets about General Slim and the Japanese Army but the main value is in view point and atmospherics.Not for everyone but anyone who has read the Flashman series should get a sense of the author behind it all .

"George MacDonald Fraser 's flawed but interesting and entertaining recollection of his service in Burma during the latter stages of WW II are well worth reading on their own merit and especially so for his legion ofFlashman A Novelreaders . Some slice of that readership will be particularly interested to see whether the memoir reveals just how much Flashman reflected the real thinking of the author . Fraser expressed his disdain for such modern PC readers in a piece excerpted in The Daily Mail around the time of his death in 2008 from another memoir he wrote about his experiences as a movie screenwriter calledThe Light 's on at Signpost . Ouch.Fraser 's recollections come with a few drawbacks worth noting . For some reason Fraser felt compelled to explain why he was writing this book . One would think that a book about a famous author 's service in Burma would not really require such explanation . I suppose what he really meant was why was he writing it after all those years ? the personal history was not published until 1992 and had been written recently from memory and not based on any contemporaneous notes or early draft.Fraser explains that firstly he is recording what may be the last great battle in the last great war . Such an utterance of sodden nonsense is disappointing coming from the author of the Flashman books that if anything establish humanity 's ready willingness to blow one another 's brains out See e.g.Flashman and the Redskins . He fears that the battle has been forgotten but gives a hint of his real motive when he laments the changed attitudes to war . Fraser also notes that he is offering a soldier 's view of the Burma campaign rather than the already welltold officer 's view.Fraser slips off the rails however when he further justifies his book by an attack on Paul Fussell'sWartime Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War or rather a review of that book . As becomes clear in reading Fraser 's war memoir he and Fussell experienced war or recall their war experiences in profoundly different ways Fussell wrote Wartime in 1989.. Fussell was severely psychologically damaged by his war experiences as well as physically wounded . Fussell set out to knock down many of the myths of WW II the socalled Good War and Fraser is outraged by such attitudes not outraged enough to have actually read the book however . Fraser is intent on preserving as many of the myths as possible which he denies are myths . More unsettling is Fraser 's adamant unwillingness to accept that other soldiers experienced the war in starkly different terms He flatly states Fussell presents a view which is false..Fraser 's tale focuses on his 8man 'section ' equivalent to a US squad of his platoon . He does not use the soldiers ' actual names for reasons that are not entirely convincing . Like Flashman Fraser was working from memory but unlike Flashy Fraser does not have an omniscient editor adding historical footnotes and correcting his lapses of memory . Not using real names does not add to the reader 's confidence.One final bit of carping Fraser was clearly offended that views of war had changed even among soldiers and just will not let it drop . He cites modern soldiers ' confessing fear in battle to the disgusting inquisition of war reporters . In his day that was simply not done . Perhaps so at least in his own section but Fraser should heed his own counsel . He has earlier warned against trying to view WW II experiences through the outlook of today he should have inferred the corollary that viewing current actions through the outlook of 70 years ago is just as likely to lead to misunderstanding and incomprehension.Nonetheless as a devoted fan of the Flashman books I think other devotees will also enjoy the book . Fraser 's trademark dexterous use of the language employed by his Cumberland 'marras ' mates brings the characters vividly to life . He introduces the reader to topics little known but of historical importance aside from the Burma campaign itself there is the battle of Imphal and Kohima that stopped the 1944 Japanese invasion of India . The writing is crisp and a joy to read . In addition to Fussell 's Wartime I would also suggest that the reader try E.B . Sledge 's memoirWith the Old Breed At Peleliu and Okinawa . Readers may also enjoy Fraser 's lesser known works of historical fiction based on his later WW II experiences in the Middle EastThe Complete McAuslan All the Hilarious McAuslan Stories in One Volume .

"2001 's Quartered Safe Out Here is George MacDonald Fraser 's superbly written and moving recollection of his service wtih the British 14th Army in the Burma Theater at the close of the Second World War.Fraser was a 19 yearold private fresh from a public school education and assigned to an infantry section full of seasoned veterans in one of the most dangerous combat zones of the war . A journalist and novelist later in life Fraser did n't get around to writing about his wartime experiences until half a century after the fact . As a result his narrative is admittedly episodic . Fraser makes an effort to place his often vivid recollections in context provided by the official history but this account is in no way meant to be a unit or campaign history.Fraser is that unfortunately rare type an infantry private with real writing skills . His section mates become living breathing characters to the reader . His impressions of the jungle the heat the monsoons and combat with the Japanese are heartbreakingly real . The respect of the 14th Army for its commander future Field Marshal Bill Slim shines through . Fraser 's portraits of British Indian and Gurkha soldiers are by turns funny and aweinspiring in capturing their stoic professionalism under conditions of boredom and terror . His observations of the attitudes and expectations of his fellow soldiers provide some pungent perspective on just how much the world has changed since 1945.Quartered Safe Out Here is very highly recommended as a superbly written and brutally honest account of a forgotten theater of World War II a reading experience for the casual reader and the student of history alike .

"What with George Orwell loose about the shop in the 1920s and some true headcases as described by Fraser crashing about the underbrush in the war it is little wonder that apart from Mrs Aun Soon Kyi modern Burmese seem to have gone bonkers . For it was in Burma that the British found themselves engaged in an anticolonialist struggle against Japan 's brand of colonialism without meaning to do much more than protect India . Why it was necessary to protect India was apparently forgotten and indeed the British presence in the Middle East in the immediate postwar period was in order to ensure coaling and oiling stations for ships traveling to dear old India and as I have said nobody really knew why it was necessary to go to the coral strand apart from the central heating issue back home.The British empire was an Enchanted Glass that was still in existence when I was an American lad which had quite outlived its usefulness and Fraser served its last moments of military semiglory in the war . George MacDonald Fraser is a curious case . As a writer he is far more talented than many writers who 've gone on to commercial success and Hollywood yet Fraser 's audience seems limited to fans . He does not seem to go beyond a certain point.I believe this is because Fraser expresses an Englishness with which many actual Englishmen are uncomfortable . His stories are informed by a sort of irony that was perhaps perfected in the British middle and upper classes between the wars as a result of the horrific experiences of what is still known in Britain as the Great War.This is an essentially subaltern irony that speaks truth to power and which manages to display a consciousness ultimately at variance with dominant paradigms . Rather than reinforcing the military and industrial disciplines which were expressed in the treatment of Royal Navy other ranks during the conflict with Napoleon like Patrick O'Brien Fraser 's characters go with the flow as we Americans say with an eye for the main chance.Thus Fraser is quite comfortable to recount in detail just how and why the ordinary British soldier voted Churchill out in '45 and the extraordinarily decent and humane Clement Attlee in.Every so often in our republic and Britain the electorate acts in its own interests . Fraser 's British soldiers elected a Labor pol in '45 because while Winston was quite useful for frightening the Germans he 'd established beyond a doubt in the interwar period that he was completely incompetent at domestic affairs the economy and the concerns of the Missus back home about the drains.The average ranker may not have known that Winston returned England to the gold standard in '25 one of the stupidest moves ever made in the UK 's economic policy and one that caused a general strike a few years on . But he knew that Winston had been forced to wander in the wilderness in the 1930s for a dang good reason and not as part of any hero 's journey . Winston had been forced into Sheol because he was a hazard to life and limb.I realize that we Americans are supposed to idolize Churchill but there are quite enough admirable Britons George MacDonald Fraser among them who deserve a tenfoot high statue in Lake Havasu City Arizona far more than Lady Thatcher do n't get me started .

"The author of the Flashman series gives his account from the ground level of the campaign in Burma with his beloved Nine Section . This war memoir is fascinating for several reasons . First Fraser is for all intents and purposes Flashman himself the broad racial delineations the bald admiration for famous generals the unabashed Imperialist fervor mixed with rational analysis of battle even the fear of waiting before battle and the mad adrenaline rush afterwards . It strikes me that Flashy is n't a character at all just Fraser himself made a bit more cowardly and set in the Victorian era . For Fraser is one of the last of the old unreconstructed crotchety men of the empire the book is vehemently nonPC . Fraser admits that he still feels hatred for the Japs as he calls the enemy even preferring not to sit by them in public places today . The '40s propaganda image of the Jap as an evil misshapen bucktoothed barbarian who looked and behaved like something subStone Age is Fraser 's image of them to a T. Which might say something about his abilities to assess things rationally since by his own admission civilized lights must n't shine much in war or you 'll lose and his section committed what would be called war crimes today obviously both sides harbored the same kind of racist illusions but Fraser ca n't see that . He bemoans many other facets of modern mores as well like counseling and war guilt but the main thrust of the book is the sometimes funny sometimes appalling obviously soul changing experience that was war . It 's a superb war memoir peppered with odd characters and vivid battle scenes and a very important record of what the average footsoldier felt at the time . ",3
"I had to force myself to put this book down and go to bed . Once I started in I could n't put this book down . This is a soldier 's story not a history lesson . Anyone looking for a treatise on jungle warfare or the conduct of the War in Burma will have to look elsewhere . This book tells the story of one young man 's experience in Burma the section squad to American readers he served with how they lived their interactions with each other and sadly how many of them died . This is an honest up close and personal account of the face of war . There 's no romance no heroics no holding forth on the virtues of the British soldier as opposed to the Japanese soldier just a frank and unflinching look at what the author saw and experienced.This is a must read for anyone with any delusions of revisionist history of World War II in Asia . ",4
"I got this book to read about Burma . Frankly there is not much here distinctive to that country . Instead I came away with an answer to something that has puzzled me for years.Post Battle Traumatic Stress gets a lot of press . Men I have known who fought in the front lines of some of the most savage battles in Asia in the 20th century seem to have escaped this problem . I recall a tribesman from Java who was drafted to become a Japanese paratrooper he told me with a bit too much relish about chopping up Allied soldiers with his sword . Even those who were bombed and starved into capitulation or were chased out of their homeland are at peace with themselves having done their duty.Fraser who has certainly done his duty points out the responsibility the press must bear for creating PBTS . Tell someone often enough that he is wounded and he will feel pain.The social climate can also wound a soldier . When the Asian soldiers I mentioned returned to their societies they were honored and respected . Note the scene in Quiet Flows the Don where the young man go once again to listen to an elder tell his story about battles long past . Several of my Atayal neighbors were put in the front lines of the Japanese army the Tribe still holds them in honor not that they fought for Hirohito but that they did their duty honorably.America has not always been so . Read the Red Badge of Courage where the young soldier is so eager to test himself in battle . Even a wound horrible to contemplate in the days surgeons were aptly called Sawbones was not the end of the world if it were honorable and entitled the old veteran to hold court sitting on a cracker barrel.Has Western society civilized itself to the point where our psyches can no longer bear the taking of lives ? Well look at the popular TV shows and movies or the bestselling video games where you go out and hack as many players as possible to death . Not that killing is good but that a compassionate society can salve wounds . Wounds are salved with compassion not by voyeuristic probing . ",4
"If I could I would like to praise this book in the only way how by saying that it reads like a book written by a real person not a war hero . Fraser 's observations about the Japanese willingness to fight also need to be taken into account.OverallYou will read it in one sitting that is how engaging it is . ",4
"Very nice to hear Fraser in his own voice . A must read for all the Flashman addicts scattered profusely across the globe but a very good read in its own right . One of the best personal memoirs from the war I 've read especially from a junior enlisted man . Quite a bit of humor but a fair amount of fear and fatigue as well . Fraser 's comments on his view of Hiroshima from the point of view of a soldier who would have continued to soldier on had Japan not surrendered are worth reflecting on but are more convoluted than one might think . ",4
"George MacDonald Fraser creator of the Flashman series takes on not 19th Century history but rather himself this time out . Here in just over 200 pages he paints a highly evocative picture of the British Tommy slugging his way through Burma and to victory in 1945 . His memory he admits has its gaps . He recalls meeting General Slim the famed commander of the 14th Army but can not recall the day . He ca n't remember what he was doing on VJ day . But he recalls details but not the dates of them a 15 inch centipede in his tent when his canoe floundered on the Sittang when Nine section captured its first Japanese POW he definitely remembers a section member taking the man 's watch.These are probably fallible memories but it 's their honesty that makes Fraser human and it 's what makes this memoir worth reading.Fraser has captured the enlisted man 's war in Burma for all time . It would be nice to see an 8th Army veteran recall the Desert War.Fraser also like Audie Murphy 's To Hell and Back uses a great deal of dialogue in catching the eccentrities of the Cumbrian borderers of his section . He changes their names Murphy did too something common in war memoirs . However American readers might stumble over what the men are saying but while GMF admits that it 's not an exact reconstruction of what was spoken most of it the dialogue obviously is notit is entirely faithful in gist subject and style . This is of course true but one feels that GMF caught the higher truth of what life was like and as it was lived in the British Army in Burma . The eminent historian John Keegan rates Quartered Safe Out Here better than Manchester 's Goodbye Darkness and E.B . Sledge 's With the Old Breed an opinion I do not necessarily share but I do admire this book tremendously.This is a great introduction to the war in Burma and a wonderful glimpse into life in the British Army in World War II .

"I found Fraser 's memoir of his Second World War experiences in Burma to be both entertaining and enlightening . He frankly discusses the viewpoint of the British soldier in faroff from Britain Burma during the latter years of the Second World War . I found the discussions regarding war crimes to be refreshingly honest and the book is worth the price for Fraser 's viewpoint regarding the use of the Atomic bombs to end the war in the Pacific . Reader 's on both sides of this argument would do well to consider Fraser 's experience and viewpoint . I listened to the audible audio version of this book and found it to be well done if a bit hard to follow the various accents . ",4
"George MacDonald Fraser has written one of the few memoirs of the Burma campaign penned by an enlisted soldier . The author served with the famed 17th Indian 'Black Cat ' Division at the capture and siege of Meiktila through the battle of Pyawbwe and saw a final skirmish with remnents of Japanese forces at the Sittang Bend . His description of the life and attitudes much of which would now be termed politically incorrect of the average British soldier fighting in Burma is priceless . What I found particularly enjoyable is how he kept the conversation of his fellow soldiers in the vernacular of their home in Cumberland . Some may find it difficult to follow but it lends a definite air of authenticity . I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Burma campaign or wanting to read a great war memoir . ",4
"This book had been brought to my attention by the author John McKinna The SenToku Raid and others when it was learned we both had been combat infantry . And a great recommendation it was . The name of the book was taken from a Rudyard Kipling phrase in Gunga Din and outlines the infantryman 's life during the final days of WWII as the Black Cat Division pushed down the Burma road towards Rangoon.His book is unique in that it recounts the perspective of the warfighter on the ground who 's entire knowledge of a world conflict is about 300 yards . At one point he described every piece of equipment on his person a bit of historical information I found of great interest.Interspersed with this narrative however was Fraser 's meticulous research of after action reports of the units involved to weave a mosaic for the reader that helped round out the full picture of the campaign itself.Overall a great read .

"It 's been years since I first read Quartered Safe Out Here by the creator of Harry Paget Flashman VC . And I wo n't rehash everything the previous reviewers have written . Having read and reread all of the Flashman novels before picking it up and being a card carrying Flashmaniac myself I was very anxious to know more about GMF . This book certainly did n't disappoint me . After I had finished it though I wanted to find out more . I did n't realize I 'd have to wait until December 2002 to finally read the next chapter in the life of GMF in The Light 's On At Signpost which I found at amazon.com.uk for 20.13GBP . The two books are quite different except for Fraser 's AntiPC rants the one tells the story of a young GMF serving in WWII and the other an older but still funny GMF telling tales of his years writing movie scripts in Hollywood and the famous and notsofamous people he worked with during those years . At the end of The Light 's On At Signpost he briefly writes more about his family his schooling in Scotland and how he became a writer . GMF is almost 78 now He was born on April 2 1925. and I only hope he will live long and write more wonderfully funny books . ",4
"Great WWII story by a man who has not succumbed to political correctness . If you can live with that you will love it . He tells the story as it actually happened Japs and all . You really feel that you understand the soldier 's lot after you have read this book . ",4
"Even when you want them tooOk just kidding . But that is the sort of cynical joke old Fraser would appreciate.Old soldiers tales are a neglected genre but one thousands of years old a genre that has produced such classics as Anabasis and Seven Pillers of Wisdom . While Quartered Safe Out Here does not rise to that level it is a gem in it 's own right.If there is one word that describes this book it is authenticity . Fraser sounds like an old soldier . The book reads not like an intellectual telling of the strange customs of His Majesties Servants but like what you would expect a veteran telling tales at a pub to sound like . A comparatively well educated Old Soldier but an Old Soldier nonetheless and no different from others.In this book Fraser tells of his service with the Border Regiment . These are as he puts it A martial race of men with the fatalistic acceptance of bloodshed grimly practical outlook on war and piratical spirit of the Angloscottish frontier brigands of yore . As well as the constant grumbling which sounds most soldierly . Fraser mixes with his comrades well . He is often harsh in his outlook but he does not glorify war and certainly does not pretend it is enjoyabale . Nor does he display the fashionable horror at war which in some writers seems to be an obligatory assurance to the reader rather then an expression of a writer 's true outlook . War is a job to Fraser and it was as well that it be done right . He seems to have a rather grim personality and a cynical sense of irony which may grate on some but sounds like one made coarse by the stress of battle . In other words he sounds believable . His means of narrative is also believable . He gives scenes as they appear in his memory some banal some humorous or carrying a bit of pathos . And sometimes even a minor degree of romanceyes statistically it has to happen like the movies SOMETIMESas when he hears a man singing the regimental song during an assault on a Japanese position and comments that he really did hear it sung in battle and that was something worth telling about . Of course Fraser follows by telling how one of his comrades told the singer to shut up . So much for romance.Those who are uneasy with the values of previous generations might find it hard to take . Fraser is comfortable with his dislike of the Japanese approves of the British Empire and has an innate dislike of change and though some readers can accept that not all will . Like Tommy Atkins in Kipling 's poem he could be a rude fellow sometimes but he was there when he was needed and our generation owes something to him.In any case it was a well written work that shows a convincing picture of what it was like to do service in those times . Many writings have been written which told of the lives of soldiers . This one tells what it is to be a soldier . And tells it well and enjoyably . To think of Quartered Safe Out Here as giving profound messages would be wrong . Fraser is not shy about his opinions but his opinions whatever their value have been heard before and are not either more or less valid because of his experiences . Rather Fraser gives an authentic picture of what it was like . You can feel your feet ache from the endless marching feel the weight of your knapsack on your back smell the smell of death and experience the many and various fears that constitute a soldier 's life . It is a great book and well worth your time . ",4
"At times you can smell the gunpowder which is exactly what you want in a firstperson war story.The author 's somewhat amateurish writing style detracted from what could have been a better book . I found some of the dialect a bit overdone also.Still it 's a good book . If you had half stars I 'd give it three and a half . ",3
"I really liked this memoir because it talked about one of the campaigns of World War II that Americans just do n't hear as much about . In addition Fraser discussed his role in the fighting in a way that was both clear and realistic . He admits that many of the details are hazy at best after this many years but the things he remembers are related in a way that brings the other men in his Section to memorable life . Fraser does not shy away from the more grisly aspects of his service nor does he dwell on them unnecessarily . ",3
"This is one of the few biographys of WWII that has had me laughing out loud the carrot incident was all too credible and the well incident just so unexpected . GMFs turn of phrase and timing makes these naturally funny incidents hilarious.I especially appreciated the detailed descriptions of the details of daily life for a rifleman in the 1940s too often those nuts and bolts details get glossed over and without them it becomes increasingly difficult to really visualise the trials and tribulations of the frontline.GMF is undoubtedly an iconoclast his opinions are very strongly his own from the worth of a Thompson vs a SMLE or the atomic bombs to the claggage a modern rifleman must lug about the place . While you may not agree with his opinions they can not be dismissed out of hand . I do n't agree with for example his opinion on all the crud a rifleman has to carry now but I really had to examine my own thoughts and reasons before I felt comfortable with that.Overall this is an outstanding biography of the rifleman 's lot . I strongly recommend it in conjunction with The Recollections of Rifleman Bowlby and And no Birds Sang . ",4
"I read this entire book with a smile on my face punctuated by frequent outbursts of laughter . George MacDonald Fraser 's memories of his WWII service with the British Commonwealth Army in the Burma campaign was the first of his nonFlashman works I 've read . Although it 's impossible to really compare two completely different literary genres I 'll just say that Quartered Safe Out Here wasin its own unique way as hilarious if not more so than the best of the Flashman novels . The difference is that in the Flashman novels Fraser 's obvious respect for the sacrifices and achievements of the British soldier had to be viewed as a backdrop to the foreground humor while the opposite is true in this work where the humor plays a supporting role to his tribute which is explicit.Unlike his Flashman creation Fraser was an honesttogoodness war hero courageous honorable and immensely proud of his country regiment and platoon section . Like old Flashie though Fraser cuts through the B.S . and shows no tolerance for armchair generals civilian second guessing and the nattering classes ' politically correct sympathizing for Britain 's enemies so long as they were black brown or yellow . It was amusing how Fraser 's account of his argument with a bleedingheart over the atomic bombing of Japan exactly echoes Flashman 's dustup with a supercilious academic at the beginning of Flashman and the Redskins . The alert reader will notice other such episodes in this memoir that seem to have found life in that series but as Fraser noted sometimes real life in Burma was so bizarre that he would have been laughed out of town if he had tried to slip some of those stories or dialogue into his fictional novels or screenplays . That 's why I 'm glad he finally got around to writing this book . It would have been a real shame if this story had not been told.Fraser details his time as a 19 year old soldier in Burma during the last months of the war . His writing is brilliant as usual his stories engrossing his attention to detail is fascinating and the characters we meet from the lovably obscene Cumbrians to the unbelievable Captain Grief are unforgettable the more so for being real . Apart from the entertainment value which is considerable Fraser 's insights into the nature of war and the warrior are poignant and valuable as a historical record of and paean to a lost Britain . He bemoans the fact that that Britain not to mention America has been replaced by a therapeutic society of hypersensitive p.c . twits who have been severed from the warrior tradition and stoic ethos which made their existence possible in the first place . As with most of Fraser 's books it 's not for someone who thinks that the world has improved much in the last 50 years . What else is there to say ? This is simply a great book . Read it and love it . ",4
"As a longtime fan of Fraser I agree with all of the positive comments made by other reviewers and respectfuly disagree with the few negative comments even though I am sympathic to the politics involved.No one familiar with Fraser 's writing will require much if any incentive to read this masterpiece . But for those not familiar with his work I am going to take the liberty of copying a passage from QSOH that I have sent to a number of colleagues when they talked about sports film or other popular herosI was not the only one in the section guilty of suppressio veri over the night 's work but Stanley had a much more creditable reason for his reticence.He had been in the o.p . observation post with Wells and when Jap arrived they had cut out for the barbed wire . Stanley had made it into the perimeter only to find that there was no sign of Wells . So he had slipped out again without a word to anyone when the fighting was at its height into the Japinfested dark to look for him . By sheer luck he found him near the o.p . dying of bayonet wounds there was no way of helping him but Stanley had stayed with him he could have sought cover himself but he did n't . I supposed he brought the dead man in at dawn but my informant who was not Stanley himself was n't sure of all the details he had only learned the bare facts months later.I lost touch with Stanley after the war . We served together for most of the rest of the campaign and he is one of the few men of whom I can say that we literally fought side by side that came later but I never knew him well the picture of the tall quiet fair youth is not as sharp in my mind as that of Grandarse or Nick or most of the others . But whenever I hear the word hero loosely used as it so often is of professional athletes and media celebrities and people who may have done no more than wear uniform for a while I think of Stanley going back into the dark.Oh and Fraser 's description of the Ghurkas alone is worth the Price of Admission . Trust me . ",4
"Quartered Safe Out Here is one of the best combat memoirs I 've read . It ranks with One Bullet Away and With the Old Breed among the finest military writing ever published . And like those two books Fraser 's has a unique character that makes it unforgettable.Fraser served with the British Army in Burma in 1945 . He fought through the country 's dry belt and into the thick jungles of the south . Fraser points out repeatedly that though topdown military histories quickly assert that the Japanese were finished in the Burma theatre by 1945 the Japanese he fought were canny tenacious and by no means aware that they were losing . Battles and skirmishes were ferocious and bloody and Fraser saw many men die in what are now regarded as the closing stages of a backwater campaign . In addition to the battles and ambushes there were accidents and at least one terrible case of friendly fire . The effects each death had on the men in Fraser 's section are profoundly moving.Fraser had enormous affection for the men he served with and this affection shows through on every page . Each member of his section is fully fleshedout and carefully characterized . By the end of the book the reader seldom needs dialogue tags to know who is speaking . Fraser remembers his old mates with vivid clarity and he imparts those memories to the reader.Memory in fact is a major theme of his book . Fraser writes repeatedly of what he does and does not remember and why . He points out the incredible minutiae he remembers from the heat of battlefalling into a well in the middle of a firefight or the long seconds counting down a live grenade 's fusebut does not remember enormous chunks of timesuch as in the same battle the actual crossing of a broad open field across which the Japanese were hitting them with machine guns and artillery . Fraser is candid and blunt about his memories and the result is an intense honest memoir.In addition to Fraser 's candor and honesty two more traits make his book well worth reading . First despite its heavy subject matter Quartered Safe Out Here is a hilariously funny book . When Fraser falls down a well in the middle of an assault and his sergeant accosts him from above or when he spends his last few days in Burma before leaving for officer 's training in the company of an apparently loony commando leader I laughed myself to tears . Second Fraser 's opinions on current early '90s affairswhich are strong and legionare point wellargued and still relevant . I could go on but you really should read the book.Highly recommended . ",4
"As a young man George MacDonald Fraser was a ranker enlisted man assigned to the 17th Black Cat Division of the British 14th Indian Army as it pursued the Japanese south through Burma after the latter 's resounding defeat at the gates of India at Imphal . Fraser 's narrative history of his personal contribution to this campaign is QUARTERED SAFE OUT HERE.Written decades after the fact this book does not pretend to be a comprehensive history of the Burma Theater in the last months of World War II . Rather it 's the war from the perspective of Nine Section in which Fraser fought first as a Private then Lance Corporal . A section is the smallest operating unit of an infantry platoon i.e . 810 men . Besides being a vivid retelling of the author 's recollections to the extent that he remembers it 's also an intimate portrait of the organization weapons tactics and camaraderie of the British Army at section level at that time place and conflict . It 's a story told with the humor intelligence and introspection that comes with maturity and hindsight . And though some of Fraser 's bitterness towards his old foe occasionally shows age does dull the sharp edges.I remember watching a year or two ago televised interviews with old Japanese soldiers who had fought in the war sitting in their gardens in their sports shirts blinking cheerfully in the sunlight reminiscing in throatclearing croaks about battles long ago . It crossed my mind were any of you on the Pyawbwe slope and lived to tell the tale ? Well if they did at this time of day I do n't mind.Fraser is a truly gifted writer . After VJ Day he applied for and was awarded a commission as a subaltern 2nd Lieutenant in a Scottish Highland division posted to the Middle East . In this capacity his experiences served as the basis for his quite wonderful and comedic McAuslan series of fictional stories collected and available from Amazon.co.uk in THE COMPLETE MCAUSLAN . I unreservedly recommend both of these two books to anyone who has ever served in any branch of the armed forces no matter what country . I myself was in the U.S. Navy and Fraser 's works are in the ca n't put down category . ",4
"The author describes his experiences of life with the dour nononsense Cumbrian an area of Northwest England known for its downtoearth approach to life regiment fighting close combat against the Japanese in Burma the forgotten army in the forgotten war . This is definitely a man 's book the disparaging humour between the men being characteristic of the British army and better than hours of contemporary comedy.The descriptions of the childlike yet deadly to the Japanese gurkhas and charismatic Field Marshal Slim are inspirational . On one occasion a small gurkha band holds a position against wave after wave of suicidal Japanese assaults then it 's discovered they do n't have a single round of ammunition between them relying rather on their weapon of choice the kukri curved machetelike knife leaving piles of Japanese dead all around them.There is a hilarious portrayal of a type unique to the British army the eccentric upperclass officer who has no fear of danger takes the war as something of fun and is absolutely deadly in his effectiveness towards the enemy.In my opinion this is a unique precious book to be treasured showing war in the raw as it really was with real people right up against the battlezone . These guys just got on with the job . Buy this book . You will read it with relish and return to it when you need an uplift . Sheer pleasure . ",4
"GMF was an amazing writer with an ability to put the reader in the thick of it . He was also a marvelously reactionary old coot whom I would dearly have loved to listen to over a pint . The rants are the price to pay for the history lesson and it is the price I 've paid a time or two locally . Perhaps the work was too close as they say . Read it hear the voice from '43'45 and wish his shade well . ",3
"It is not often you see this many reviews all of which are 5 stars so when one does you pretty much know that this is a special book . All the reviews for the book are spot on . It rings of authenticity something that it is usually difficult for a writer do but when you finish this book you have a feeling about this man and his experiences with Nine Section that at least for me I never felt before and I have read many military history books . Nine Section is 10 men like an American army squad led my a noncommissioned officer who is more of of the men rather than an officer . There is no big picture here just what faced this one small group of men in a very difficult time and place.Fraser 's description of the 50th anniversary of VJ Day and his reluctant participation was very moving.His commentary on the spirtual hypochondria of the modern world was absolutely accurate . pg . 8990 I loved his comment on intrusive modern television journalists when he said I can regret though that there were no modern television journalists transported back in time to ask Grandarse a Nine Section soldier How did you FEEL when you saw Corporal Little shot dead ? I would have like to have heard his reply . ",4
"I ca n't add to the superlatives below . His short adventure with Captain Grief alone is worth the price of this book . After reading all the Flashman epics this is a revealing look at the author as a young man at war . Swims upstream against the current PC versions of the last days of WWII and is a moving tribute to the men of a forgotten theater of that war . Shabash ! GMF ",4
"This book is not a history of the Burma campaign but a memoir of a tiny portion of it from the Battle of Meiktile to mopping up operations after Operation Dracula . The author is very forthright about the sketchiness of his memory of events a half century earlier . He was a young private and then a corporal in a section of infantry that was part of the 17th Indian Division . His aim and the considerable charm of the book is to portray the men in his sectiontheir attitudes their speech their humor and now and then their courage . One quickly gets to recognize them and to share Fraser 's affection for themand so it is a genuine shock when now and then one of them is killed or wounded.Unfortunately from time to time he lapses from a veteran 's tenderness into an old soldier 's rant about the degenerate customs and revisionist views of the current day . It is natural enough I suppose for an elderly author but it puts the reader through increasingly dense sections of his opinions about nonBurmese subjectsthe dropping of the atomic bombs the lack of respect for stiff upper lips the poppsych interrogations of TV journalists . It is not so much a question of whether his opinions are correct or politically correct as it is a question of whether those curmudgeonly passages add to the flavor of the work or dilute it . ",3
"Enough has been said by others . Suffice to say this is one book that I have given away more often than any other and have bought to replace more often than any other ! It is also the book that those friends and I enjoy discussing more than any other over a pint . Thank you George MacDonald Fraser . ",4
"good book just did n't hold my attention.bought it due to the author and his Flashman series.Good tale of woe during WWII in the CBI theater but just lost my attention . ",3
"George Macdonald Fraser has written an utterly gripping and unforgettable memoir of the war in Burma where he served with a company of men mainly from Cumberland . His comrades are vividly described so that you feel you have known them yourself and it is a terrible shock when nearly halfway through the book one of them is killed during a bloody nighttime battle . There are richly comic passages too like the time the section is given the job of gathering up provisions from an air drop and return laden with stolen booty or the time they are terrorised by a giant centipede or the time Fraser falls down a well . Every time I read this book I find myself wishing that I had been one of those young men fighting my way through the jungle which is completely crazy as the closest I 've ever come to combat is seperating two squabbling toddlers . By the end of the book when Fraser leaves to become an officer I feel as sad as if I was saying goodbye to my own friends and I can never hear the tune byebye blackbird without substituting the Burma version you 've been out with SunYatSen you wo n't go out with him again Shanghai byebye ! The most astonishing thing is that he was only nineteen when he was performing incredible acts of courage in the jungle eventually even having to lead the section himself . An extraordinary story told bu a superb writer . Read it and laugh . Read it and weep . Read it and wish you were there too . Oh just read it ! ",4
"There are a few personal accounts of war and its impact on a man that stand out in the sea of such literature works such as Goodbye to All That Homage to Catalonia and The Men I Killed . Quartered Safe Out Here has now joined that short list . MacDonald Fraser is the acclaimed author of the Flashman series of historical fiction but here he reveals his own experience as an infantryman in merciless combat against the Japanese in Burma . Here is an alltoovivid recollection of the fear pain discomfort and yes the pleasure of comradeship among the common soldiers who win or lose ALL wars . MacDonald Fraser reminds us that wars are not just politics by other means wars are about young men their lives their deaths and their friendships . As one reviewer said MacDonald Fraser has raised a memorial with this book . Read it ! ",4
"I ordered this book because of a favorable mention in the Wall Street Journal . The favorable mention was entirely justified . Fraser 's descriptions of small unit infantry actions in the 1945 battles along the Rangoon Road are interesting enough . But the reason to read the book is its elegiac tone for many things in England that wereand never will be again . ",4
"George MacDonald Fraser best known for his Flashman novels and in my opinion one of our best writers gives us here his nearly fiftyyearold memories of his service in Burma in 1945.There is so much to like about this book that it 's difficult to know where to begin . There is Fraser 's absolute honesty about his fears his mistakes his attitude toward the Japanese and the virtues and vices of his comrades . There is his ability to place his unit 's activities within the context of larger campaigns and yet give a vivid impression of what fighting with his unit must have been like . There is his brief but compelling portrait of General William Slim for whom he has an unabashed admiration . There are moments of low humor of heroism and of tragic loss of life and there is an unapologetic pride in what he his comrades and the rest of the British and Allied forces accomplished.This is one of the best books that I have ever read and I recommend that you make it one of yours . ",4
"Very good account of British army against the Japanese in the jungles of Burma leading to the defeat of Japanese army . ",4
"If you 're looking for history that lives for a firsthand account of what war is really like or can be or for an often poignant often entertaining occasionally shocking reminder of the bravery and courage of soldiers who have barely escaped childhood you 'll have to look long and hard for better than this.Fraser gives us 'the other side of the coin ' there 's no chestbeating 'War Is Bad ' sentimentality here no complaining no selfpity . He brings vividly to life a group of comrades who fought because they believed in something who would have carried on fighting if asked to and who died forgotten or demeaned through revisionist histories for the freedoms and rights that we enjoy today.But he gives us even more as you 'd expect from such a classy bestselling author he gives us a riviting fastpaced soldier 's tale something that were it not true would easily sit with any novel on the shelves of your local bookshop . He gives us something which when all 's said and done is absolutely readable . And for that as much as anything else you should want to buy this book . ",4
"This wonderful autobiography of Frazer 's wartime experiences with British forces in Burma should be compulsory reading in military training schools . The book contains all of the hallmarks of fluid writing natural dialogue and a fine storytelling sense that readers of Frazer 's Flashman books know well . But here too is a compassion for the ordinary soldier and a realistic accounting of how Frazer 's companions thought felt and fought their way through one of the harshest battlegrounds of the Second World War.Some of Frazer 's views about the Japanese about the treatment of prisoners of war about how soldiers regarded war dead from their own numbers may make contemporary readers uncomfortable . But the book is all the more valuable because of Frazer 's willingness to recount what he remembers from the time rather than to sugarcoat or glamorise some difficult truths.I would have liked to read 'Quartered Safe Out Here ' some years earlier when my father a Second World War veteran was still alive . The books gives an insight into the thinking and experiences of a remarkable generation of people . I could not recommend it more strongly for those interested in the psychology of conflict or in the experiences of the Second World War generation . ",4
"I found this very touching . A tale of adversity melded with stoicism . It is neither pro war or anti war . Just matter of fact we had a job to do and we made the best of it.Strongly recommended ",4
"I first read this book back in the 90s when it was much harder to find and it is without question the best memoir of WWII or any other war I have ever encountered . I am not a huge fan of Fraser 's fiction but here the writing is powerful deeply personal unsparing and poignant while being precise.Most important this book conveys what it is really like to live outside the bubble that so many people who are the beneficiaries of the heroism described in this book cocoon themselves in . This is Real Life and we forget dismiss or ignore these lessons at our peril.A profound and profoundly important book . ",4
"While I agree with the reviewer who criticized the soapbox entries in Fraser 's book about WWII in Burma I ca n't subtract a star for that flaw . I think most of those entries were worth saying though I 'd prefer to have seen them in footnotes or gathered as an epilogue.The book is realistic grim in part hilarious in part Fraser 's account of his first operation as a corporal with his gang had me laughing out loud realistic throughout . I think he captures the essence of soldiers in the grinding often miserable front lines . ",4
"I count myself a true fan of The Flashman Series by George MacDonald Fraser and so could not resist picking up his own memoirs of the Burma campaign in WWII when I saw it in a London bookstore . I was not disappointed . Fraser writes so warmly of his experiences with his Unit of Cumberland soldiers as they fought their way toward Rangoon . There is the hardness of battle worn veterans in mortal combat with a deadly enemy levied by a camaraderie and slowly gained respect for men in the far end of the world isolated except for each other 's company . Fraser spares nothing relative to the cruelty and also to the role of luck in who makes it and who does n't and his battle and combat writing is superb . What sets this war memoir apart is his willingness to record dialogue between military comrades much of it written in a Cumbrian dialect that brings his former comrades to life and makes this such an engaging read . It 's the camp life tea time discussions that you 'll remember more than the battles and movement of troops . This may not be the best WWII memoir but it certainly a fine one written by a remarkably gifted writer and I enjoyed it very much . ",3
"Quartered Safe Out Here was far from the best personal accounts of participation in WWII . It does not hold a candle to Eugene Sledge 's With the Old Breed . Quartered is slow moving without much real action . Much of the action in the campaign seems to take place on other fronts and this is mostly about camp life . ",1
"While Britain was ingloriously kicked out of SE Asia in 1941 their soldiers seemed to exemplify the worst effects of years of defeat and despair . The debacle of Burma and Singapore and the debilitating effects of defeat infected both the British Indian and Commonwealth armies . After the defeats and the long road back is where George Mac Fraser comes in.The British and Indian Armies has been integrated trained and tested in the rugged battles of Imphal and Kohima . The Black Cat Division full of men from mostly Cumbria are ready to be tested in the long road back to Rangoon . Fraser recounts his role in the big push to capture most of Burma and then the mopup operations with British Special Forces in the closing weeks of the war.Fraser 's autobiographical writing is characteristically wry and at times cynically humourous . At other times he evinces what one may call the ugly side of the racist feeling of the enemy that filled the heads of both sides in this conflict . Like a lot of authors of the same era Japanese are Japs and they are a lesser form of humanity . Lesser because they kill rape and murder and kill British POWs to a degree that the British soldier and any normal human being finds shocking . What happens is in turn a dehumanisation of the British Indian soldier and any notion of him being a gentlemanly warrior . Quarter is neither asked nor given . Killing Japs and more Japs becomes the end in itself . When the initial offence breaks the backs of the main line of Japanese defence the Gurkhas hunt Japanese with their long Kukris Indian troops kill Japanese wounded and the British go for vengence.At the end of the book Fraser is aware of the mentality engendered on him and his men . He makes no apologies for it . In one of his more famous quotes he asks if the British soldier fully cognizent of what the A Bomb would do the Japanese women and children would withhold bombing if giving the choice . He answers that if it could in some way end the suffering on the Burma Front by shortening the hell they faced then the British Soldier would join in a single chorus that yes use the damned thing.It is chilling in the sense what this war in the jungle did to them . Fighting far from home in a jungle with sparse rations rotting clothes little rest constant wet of the monsoons or constant dryness of the central plains the wasting of the body and the mind is much in evidence in this book.Fraser also loved his mates and the times he spent with them . Those days around fires on the Central Plains the intial rush to capture Rangoon before the Monsoon rains is very poetically detailed by this warrior Scot . Seven years after reading this book I can still remember his description of when the chase ends and the first drops of the monsoon rains come as the weary troops rest on the road to Rangoon.The British Warrior poet is a much more developed genre than its American counterpart . In this war there are many good British haunting memoirs about the Burma Front and the Fogotten War.But this is still one of the best and stays with you a very long time . ",4
"The author chose to use the British colloquial accents phonetically which was as difficult to read as if it were in German . This book was obviously written for the British reader but the American reader would spend a goodly portion of his time trying to pronounce words and phrases and than understand the entire sentence . The Burma campaign is all but foreign to the American public more so than the history of the Eastern Front during WWII . We obviously have not given credit to our allies especially when we have a General MacArthur in the vicinity . There are better books on the Burma campaign written for the American reader . ",1
"This memoir reads as though you 're eavesdropping on a winding beerfueled monologue at the local VFW or whatever the British equivalent is.George MacDonald Fraser became an accomplished author in the postwar years but began his adult life as an infantry man in Burma in the final six months of the Second World War . He waited a full halfcentury before penning his reminiscences . It is highly entertaining a wonderful portal into common life in the British army and all told with a curmudgeonly punch reminding me of Dana Carvey 's 1990s SNL character Grumpy Old Man e.g . we marched uphill in the rain under constant mortar fire from the Japsand we liked it ! .For students of military history or the Second World War specifically Quartered Safe Out Here has several things to offer . First it puts classic narrative military campaign histories in perspective with Fraser stressing that when you read X division encountered slight resistance it may have been the most eventful and terrifying experience of the entire war for some group of young men who engaged in that resistance . It also shines a light on a forgotten front at a time when most were celebrating the defeat of Hitler and hardly gave the Japanese much thought further demonstrating that all war experiences at the gruntlevel is personal and intimate . It occurred to me that Fraser would probably strongly endorse the arguments made by Jonathan Shay in Achilles in Vietnam a penetrating look at small unit dynamics during extending close combat experience.Second the author clearly wrote this book in part at least as a response to what he sees as contemporary revisionism on the war and specifically the feelings and motivations of those who fought it . Fraser for one is unreconstructed and proudly so . Even fifty years after the fact he still refers to the Japanese as Japs and candidly admits that he does n't like sitting next them on airplanes and refuses to buy their cars . Moreover he feels no remorse or pity for anything the Japanese may have suffered during the 14th Army 's roll through Burma and that lack of war guilt extends to the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki . Fraser seems keen to leave this powerfully written testament for current and future academics to wrestle with the next time they want to reinterpret how the greatest generation got on during the horror of the Second World War.Finally Fraser writes with rare skill and clarity especially his ability to capture the tone and vernacular of his unit mates nearly all of whom were Cumbrian the author is Scottish and was thus known as Jock by the men . I 'm writing this review from southern Afghanistan where I 'm serving mostly with British soldiers so this aspect of the book resonated strongly with me . In fact I 'm not sure I would have even been able to read MacDonald 's phonetic spelling of the Cumbrian patois if I had n't been immersed in a sea of working class British accents myself.Depending on your politics this book may not be for you . But if you love war memoirs Quartered Safe Out Here is not to be missed . ",4
"Fraser tells the foot soldier account of the war against the Japanese as he experienced it so the larger battle has to be gleaned elsewhereexactly the way war is experienced by a frontline soldierclose and local . So I found watching some You Tube film clips of the Burma campaign added the larger context and valuable statistics about the astounding number of casualties from jungle diseases . ",4
"A great memoir a different view of WWII to all those who think Steven Speiberg told the story of the war Read this ",4
"I 've never read any of Fraser 's Flashman books but being a fan of wartime memoirs I thought I 'd try this one . Fraser has an awesome ear for dialogue and dialect that will have you reading these downinthetrenches conversations aloud just trying to get a sense of them . And when you do you 'll often laugh out loud I guarantee it . A very selfeffacing and modest man about his wartime efforts in Burma Fraser 's thoughtful narrative about his 9 Section 's hijinks just shines ! And after making you laugh and giggle through his story he 'll finally make you cry when your read his epilogue added on the 50th anniversary of VJDay . I wish I could have known this man a born storyteller who died in January 2008 . I salute you LanceCorporal Fraser . Thank you for your story .

"I have greatly enjoyed the author 's Flashman series and had been unaware that he had also written this fine memoir of his service on the Burma front in 1945 . Fraser takes us to the section US equivalent the squad level the cutting edge for infantry as Section Nine battles its way through the jungles of Burma . Helpful was a glossary of Cumbrian speech and oaths . It was a campaign that is largely overlooked now but one that demanded fierce fighting skills and loyalty to one 's squad when they were not coming to blows verbal or actual.The oddness of the surroundings may perhaps have foreshadowed the Flashman series . I am reminded of George Orwell 's Burma Days as presaging his later famous political books . And a semiliterate section member borrowing a copy of Henry V from young Fraser inevitably Jock utters one of the most unexpected tributes to Shakespeare since the Broadway hit song Brush Up Your Shakespeare.Fraser 's idiosnycratic comments from a distance of fifty years on such matters as the Churchill lost election of 1945 or the role of section loyalty may jar some readers but no one can doubt that he earned his right to make such comments . It was a hard school albeit a school in session before the days of PTSD and IED bombs as devastating perils for today 's infantry . Highly recommended . ",4
"Quartered Safe Out Here by George MacDonald Fraser is Mr Fraser 's memoirs of his service as a 19 year old Scottish Private and Corporal toward the tail end of the Burma Campaign in World War II . Written over 50 years after the war this book is not meant to be an exhaustive study of the campaign but covers what he remembers of the battles he fought and gives a delightful depiction of the men he fought alongside and with in Burma against the Japanese.Early on in the book Mr Fraser describes his memories as a long line of grey where he remembers generally what was happening but with few specifics alongside occasional bursts of vivid color where he can remember a tremendous amount of detail and not all of it relevant . Nearly 50 years old myself I find that 's a pretty accurate portrayal of how my older memories are too such as my days in college or when I was in the Service . He fits his recollections in with a broader description of the fighting in Burma during the time he served in a generally chronological generally episodic manner in line with his memories.Where this book really shines is in its daytoday depiction of the life of an infantryman in this theater . He covers everything from the challenges of the jungle heat monsoons poisonous critters to what he wears and eats and to his impressions of the many different nationalitiescultural subdivisions that fought in the 14th Army British Indians Sikhs Gurkans Africans and so on . But best of all is his descriptions of his sectionmates a much more experienced battlehardened and humorously sarcastic bunch that fought and beat the Japanese . There are also battle scenes both large and small although as the author points out what makes an action slight or deadly dangerous depends pretty much on your perspective what higher headquarters may barely notice could be the most dramatic fighting of the war for the people involved.The book is refreshingly politically incorrect which is to say honest to the era and to what the men involved truly felt and believed . While in my experience most veterans of the Western Front in World War II have forgiven and are reconciled to the Germans the veterans of the Pacific front virtually to a man still hate the Japanese and will until their dying breath.I highly recommend this book .

"Wellwritten account of fighting in Burma . There is a lot of honesty about war in this book he does n't sugarcoat either side . An honest book about a tough fight in a brutal war . ",4
"Fast 5 read . British history of the border limited from about Edward the Hammer to James I of England . Still a history of many things and the changing aspect of EnglishScots relationships . Amazingly this conflict is not terribly clouded by the religious fervors of slightly later in time except by the machinations of the Anglican Church against the Roman . Still not much of that lapsed into the borders just plain deviltry as espoused by the inhabitants and the followers of kings . The end of the thousand years of border turmoil is in itself an epic of both government power and the jaundiced legendary romancers of later ages . NO mention of Strathclyde or Arthur or the coming of so many conquerors for centuries but the compelling story of familial survival in a very rough environment . A personal favorite from the early seventies it is still a most compelling read of it 's times . Thanks Harry ! ",4
"But very confusing . Author spends alot of time jumping around time wise and then finally outlines the 16th century from beginning to end . While he gets the point accross that the borderlands were a dangerous neighborhood it 's pretty hard to follow since it leaps from the 1520 's to the 1580 's and back again to the 1850 's . Even the recap of the 16th century sometimes does this . I have read several of Fraser 's historical fictions and was looking forward to reading this book . It turned into a sluggish and tedious read ",2
"With all the focus on Scotland being tied to all things tartan the peoples of the Borderlands often overlooked . George MacDonald Fraser paints a spectacular portal into the tumultuous life of the Border Rievers and all they came in contact with . The objective writing style favors neither Scotland nor England . He does not attempt to justify one side or the others action it just is what it is . This approach fits in perfectly with the frequency in which loyalties and rivals switched sides and waged a blood feud that is still felt in parts today . Anyone who is remotely interested in anything associated with Scotland England organized crime or just a good history will bask in the wonder of this spectacular book . ",4
"This is a very enjoyable read and I 'm not a big fan of history books . The book is a great introduction to life on the border between Scotland and England during the 15001600ish period . Although tedious and challenging at times I really appreciate the way the author segments the story . His technique answered the I wonder how . questions that always pop up when I am reading . This technique became challenging when the same people families and events were mentioned in multiple chapters Did I mention that I 'm not a big fan of history books ? . If you want to learn about the Border Riever clans and lifestyle this is your book . ",3
"This is a wellwritten and thoroughlyresearched study of the reivers on the ScottishEnglish border particularly in the 16th century . After 1603 they were ruled by the same king so border wars stopped but not thieving . Details of many raids blood feuds and atrocities by both sides make clear that neither side was entirely innocent or entirely guilty . Neither the authorities in London nor those in Edinburgh knew what to do and generally gave up on the situation . The author names names and places and anyone with a borderer surname needs to see what hisher ancestors or relatives were up to . A fascinating story welltold . One complaint I have I really REALLY wish Kindle books had page numbers ! ",4
"I was very happy to receive this excellent quality book on time . I had lost my original hardback copy and was devastated . I was not sure what the paper copy would be like but the book is in good condition looks new . Very good book and service . It details the history of the west Border clans in Scotland and I am looking forward to rereading this book . The most famous ones are the Maxwells Nixons Johnstons grahams and others whose facial structure remains the same today . Think of Richard Nixon Billy Graham and Lyndon Johnson . That is what they all looked like and still do . They led a hard life and this gives a good historical understanding of these feuding clans . I have started but not finished it but it is an excellent book . ",4
"Enjoy those Wild West movies ? The ones with the shootouts the cattle raids the feuds between two rival ranchers ? How about the Hatfields and McCoys ? That AllAmerican tradition did n't grow out of the soil of North America . It was imported from the border of Scotland and England . Basically the ancient kingdoms of Strathclyde and Northumbria and after King James ' Plantations in Ireland Ulster.This borders region was the home to the Border Reivers lowland Scots and North English Clans that raided cattle engaged in longrunning feuds and resisted the power of the Kingbe it the King of Scotland or the King of England . On both sides of the border the Reivers were more loyal to their kith and kin than either kingdom and often switched nationalities at their own convenience.This book describes the cultural scene of the Reivers and many of the highpoints of their activities and feuds . This boils down to a historical Wild West story with steel helmets lances and matchlock guns rather than six shooters and cowboy hats.What is most interesting is his layout of prominent Border Reiver family names variations on spelling and their alliances and hostile relations with other clans . A casual perusal through my own family tree finds such names along with a time and placeWestern Pennsylvania between 17201800the timeframe and destination for many ScotsIrish Border Reivers that headed to America.Absolutely worth it for any person interested in history genealogy or just the ScotsEnglish relationship .

"Fraser is quite a writer best in others of his works where he can use his talented imagination . And as a reporter of his own exploits in Burma during the war his ability is outstanding one should read Quartered Safe Out Here.However here in Steel Bonnets his hands are tied by tiresome reality and a remove of 400 years . Fraser admits this book is not a primer or even a text for college study but it is a recount of his research and written with nostalgic favor since he comes from the border area himself . Mr. Fraser has great pride in his background and home and he repeats the stories as faithfully as anyone could . The problem with Bonnets is that it has n't much of a story.In the first six pages of the book all to be said is done the remainder is elaboration on who when and where . Bandits raid other people 's farms and towns burning stealing killing etc.. Generations of upwards to thirty families continue this insanity until Scotland is joined to England in about 1605 or so with James VI and I.IF you ARE related to border riding EnglishScots especially if named Graham Johnstone Maxwell or Armstrong Kerr Hume Elliot or Nixon then the book is well worth a look .

"In the sixteenth century the border between Scotland and England was the much foughtover scene of frequent warfare between the two kingdoms . The families on both sides fell into an armed seminomadic existence whose economic mainspring was raiding the other side for cattle property and slaves . In The Steel Bonnets accomplished journalist novelist and historian George MacDonald Fraser takes on the challenging task of making sense of the AngloScottish border reivers as these raiders were called . Proof of his success may lie in the fact that The Steel Bonnets has never been out of print since first publication in 1971.In his characteristic animated prose Fraser lays out the background of the border area identifies its people and describes their distinctive lifestyle . His narrative is commendably evenhanded . If violence robbery and chicanery was a way of life for the reivers he provides the necessary context . In a land without law armed force was a necessity for survival . The long conflict between border families and with the uncertain law enforcement of the border districts has many layers . Fraser does his best to make sense of it all . He makes liberal use of colorful anecdotes to move the narrative along and to characterize a complicated history.With the union of the English and Scottish crowns in 1603 the shelter of the border went away the reivers were scourged out of existence in just ten years by a ruthless application of hanging justice . Fraser notes the similarities of the AngloScottish border in its lawless heyday with the presentday frontiers of Pakistan and Afghanistan those responsible for pacifying that bloody border may find here some useful lessons . The Steel Bonnets is very recommended as a superb example of wellwritten history . ",4
"As my command of the English language once again fails me in regards to communicating how good the author is let me just say that just as Black Ajax convinced us all that GMF missed his calling as a sports writer and Quartered Safe Out Here convinced us he should have been a lecturer talking about his experiences in Burma this current book also tells us something.GMF again missed his calling in addition to being an excellent writer of fiction as is evidenced by the Flashman series The Steel Bonnets shows that GMF had the makings of a serious historian.His tragic although not entirely unexpected death robbed us of one of the great authors of the 20th century . ",4
"This is a good history of the Border area between Scotland and England . It moves pretty well and has a wealth of historic fact . Knowing how well Fraser wrote I wish he 'd brought more into it possibly would have been better as fiction . Never the less it is a good popular history . ",3
"When Scott says they abhorred and avoided the crime of unnecessary homicide one can only comment that they seem to have found homicide necessary with appalling frequency.The Steel Bonnets by George Macdonald FraserThis delightfully cynical line is one of my favorites of the book . It shows Fraser 's sardonic personality as well as giving a healthy contempt for the romanticism of brigandage.In The Steel Bonnets the author describes a world in which law was half broken the sword was the ruler and woe betide the weak . It is the old Angloscottish border . Long a frontier of war people could not count on normal guarentees of their survival . With civilization stolen from them they became barbarians . And remained so for centuries . And the tales of their life still remain.The Steel Bonnets gives a picture of life on the border . It describes local customs the techniques of raiding as well as some of the most important clans . It is pleasingly unsentimental and does not regard border chieftains as heros simply because they were successful raiders . But it does give a fascinating portrait of their life . And it does not hide that if border raiders were vicious the English and Scottish governments were not pillers of virtue either . It also gives a history of border politics and ends finnally with the brutal pacification of the region by King James who as the author wryly acknowledges was acting in a manner not dissimilar to his victims.The most attractive figure in the book was the Elizabethan lawman Robert Carey who deserves to be better known for he handled the difficult job of policing the border honestly valiantly and not without mercy.The Steel Bonnets is a book that is very much worth reading .

"I once had a printed copy not Kindle . It 's a fascinating write up of an incredible piece of UK history complete with all the warts . ",4
"As an history loving antipodean from family both Scottish and English and a Nixon on one side to boot ! this is a pure joy to read . The Border Marches the bit where Scotland and England used to meet before the Act of Union were rough if beautiful country populated by rougher and vicious men . The book is pretty quiet on what the Border women were like but one imagines that they were no shrinking violets either . Perhaps they were the beautiful ones.There were 6 Marches each run by a Warden 3 on each side of the Border . It appears that the main local industry was horsetheft with cattletheft sheeptheft arson and robbery not far behind . Tradition holds that the borderers were not fond of unnecessary killing but as GMF puts it well they seemed to find killing necessary with troubling frequency . These were the reivers and GMF a Scotsman raised in England is telling their story and that of the Wardens who policied them when the Wardens were not in fact reiving themselves.GMF is best known for the fictional Flashman but he was also the author of a lot of other stuff including the semiautobiograhpical McAuslan and the actuallybiographical Quartered Safe Out Here . That was a good enough memoir of the Burma campaign in WWII for Max Hastings to see fit to quote it at length in his history of the Pacific War . The Steel Bonnets is both an accurate history of sixteenth century Border country their long kiss goodnight and also a riproaring tale history told like it is fiction with hot trods blood feuds and international politics all mixed together and topped off with a reprint of the incredible Monition of Cursing which is best read out loud if you can get through it without laughing in admiration . There are some incredible characters here all told in GMF 's dry voice which never fails to amuse entertain and inform.This is a little piece of history which should never be forgotten wherever the AngloScottish reivers have settled themselves in the 400 years since their story ended .

"THE STEEL BONNETS by George MacDonald Fraser is a prodigious and esoteric historical narrative about the AngloScottish border . The time is the 16th century . The place and players are indicated by the book 's subtitle The Story of the AngloScottish Border Reivers reivers being raiders . The place is more specifically the six administrative areas called Marches 3 English and 3 Scottish West Middle and East on each side of the line which straddled the border to serve as a buffer zone.Having grown up in Carlisle the former bastion of the English West March Fraser has written a work of love divided into five parts . In the first three Fraser describes the genesis of the Border Marches the Wardens one per March that were responsible for the maintenance of order the raider families that lived there and the culture and practice of violence that characterized the area . The author 's catalog of depredations based on research of contemporary records includes murder arson blackmail kidnapping rustling racketeering feuding plunder and banditry all made infinitely worse by the indifference andor cynical scheming of the English and Scottish central governments which tolerated the notinfrequent participation in the mayhem by the Wardens themselves . Part 4 is a sequential narrative history of events along the Border during the 16th century the last before James VI of Scotland united the island 's thrones as James I of Great Britain . Part 5 describes this monarch 's brutal suppression of both the violence and raider families of the Marches during the first decade of the 17th century an effort that finally brought peace to the region.THE STEEL BONNETS offers a surfeit of detail . At times as Fraser brings on stage the multitude of principal characters and attempts to unravel the maze of evershifting family alliances and feuds Scot vs. Anglo Scot vs. Scot Anglo vs. Anglo everybody vs. everyone the reader may decide the author went over the top . However the story is never uninteresting and the social chaos is appalling.If the reader was delighted by the humor in Fraser 's other books e.g . the McAuslan and Flashman series there may be some disappointment as this narrative is relatively straitlaced . However even here the author 's dry wit occasionally shows . Regarding the assumption of the English East March Wardenship by Henry Carey in 1588 his notion of Border justice was that the only good reiver was a dead one a point of view which has much to be said for it . Possibly the fact that he suffered from gallstones made him irritable for he started in office as he meant to continue by hanging Scottish thieves.And as always Fraser 's prose is a joy to behold as demonstrated by his closing remarksOnly now and then if your romantic imagination is sharp enough there can come a little drift from the past most vivid of all perhaps in a little fellside village at night when there is a hunter 's moon and a strong wind and the black cloud shadows hurry across the tops and beasts stamp in the dark and an inn door down in the village opens and slams with a blink of light and the rough Norse voices sound and laugh and die away The old Border is buried a long time ago and there is hardly a trace now to mark where the steel bonnets passed by .

"In this wonderful look at a dark and fascinating period in AngloScottish history Fraser brings the same quirky attitude and deep appreciation of man 's inherent rascality that make the Flashman books and his novel Mr American q.v . so iminently readable to the explication of the complex and violent history of the Border reivers.Beginning with a Foreword that among other things describes the jolt he got watching Richard Nixon 's Inauguration on television when he saw Lyndon Johnson Richard Nixon and Billy Graham standing together on the platform he explains in typical fashion that Johnson Nixon and Graham are all names that figured strongly in the reiving years and thateach as well wore faces that might well still be seen in the Border country today.He delves into the history of Hadrian 's Wall Any Englishman can tell you why it was built 'To keep the Scots out ! ' and speculates how AngloScottish history might have been changed were the Wall a few milse north or south.And then he dives off into the history of the Border and the Reivers.This is not a standard dry history text laying everything out in a straight linewith dates and battles to memorise and all the juice sucked out of it.No Fraser skips around first giving us an outline of the whole period he then in subsequent chapters cover different aspects of the history in depth and not necessarily chronologically.He gives us fascinating details such as why the spiral stairs in the watch towers built by the Kerr family tended to spiral anticlockwise instead of the usual clockwise in the process defining and explaining the origin of the term correy fisted.He writes of the great feuds among the reiving families many of whom were to be found on both sides of the Border of the practise of blackmail somewhat different than the meaning the term has today and in what manner one might legally pursue raiders back across the Border to attempt to retrieve one 's property.Explaining the administrative setup of the Border he describes the careers and personalities of several of the more prominent Border Wardens lawmen assigned by both England and Scotland to keep the peace but never given the budgets or forces they needed.He introduces us to several of the prominent reivers including some of Sir Walter Scott 's ancestors and recounts their deeds.He analyses the economy of the Border and the reiving system as well as anyone can at this remove and from extant records and shows howthis all affected the overall history ofAngloScottish relations.And for good measure he includes the truly Monition of Cursing issued by the Archbishop of Glasgow against the reivers a masterful piece of vituperation that runs four or more full pages depending on the edition.Not a history text in the classic sense not a novel because it 's all true Fraser has presented the reader with a corking good reading experience that opens the window on another time and place whose influences still reverberate in the world today.About the spelling of Eliot or Ellet or Eliott The family seemed to not mind how their name was spelt Fraser lists a large number of variant spellings with various permutations of Ls and Ts . He then points out that almost any were acceptable except for some reason the double L and double T a spelling the family affected for some reason to despise ",4
"Until England and Scotland were united under a single king in March 1603 the border between them was unsurprisingly a natural place for strife and disorder . The two countries had been at war intermittently for centuries and many armies had passed back and forth across the border counties . Fraser 's history covers the last hundred years of the border from 1503 to 1603 a period during which the decayed and astonishingly corrupt administration could never cope with the local gangs known as reivers who terrorized the district with cattle theft murder and arson.The book is very wellorganized . Fraser starts with a few pages on the long historical background then takes about half the book to cover the reivers by topic chapters on arms and armour on reiving technique on the key families and their alliances on crossborder relations on the administrative structure . Fraser gives a lot of details and plenty of quotes from the original sources with the original spellings ! .This painstaking coverage sets up the second half of the book perfectly one hundred and forty pages that cover the history of the border chronologically through the sixteenth century . With the details in hand the second half is easy to follow and put in context the writing is also clear and entertaining.The last section of the book details the uncompromising way in which King James I destroyed the reivers in a few short years after 1603 . It is a startlingly bloodthirsty story Fraser includes quotes from blanket pardons that King James issued to some of his enforcers which essentially say whatever murders you did I 'm sure it was in a good cause and you 're absolved.There are separate chapters on some of the most famous events notably the raid on Carlisle Castle that freed Kinmont Willie . Fraser is at some pains to dispel the romantic ideas that cling to stories of the borderers as he points out they were essentially a Mafia with little of Robin Hood about them . It 's clear though that he finds their adventurousness and style endearing and fascinating and he writes about them so well that you are likely to feel the same way . ",4
"Most of us think of Elizabethan Britain as a reasonably peaceful place . Shakespeare and Marlowe writing plays Edmund Spenser writing The Faerie Queen Sir Francis Bacon inventing science to replace natural philosophy the English Renaissance.However there was one part of Britain that underwent continuous terror and warfare the Borders . The area lying around the border between Scotland and England was an almost lawless place . Great numbers of the people inhabiting the Border Marches lived by despoiling each other . The 16th Century was when great tribes feuded continuously among themselves when robbery and kidnapping were everyday professions when raiding arson murder and extortion were an important part of the social system . This had little to do with war between the two countries who spent most of the century at peace with each other . Much of the raiding was not crossborder but rather English attacking English and Scots stealing from other Scots . It was a way of life pursued in peace time by people who accepted it as normal . The seamen of the first Elizabeth might sweep the world 's greatest fleet off the seas but for all the protection she could give to her Northumbrian peasants they might as well have been in Africa.While the monarchs of England and Scotland ruled the relatively secure hearts of their kingdoms the narrow hill land between was dominated by the lance and the sword . The tribal leaders from their towers the broken men and outlaws of the mosses the ordinary farmers of the valleys in their own phrase shook loose the Border . They continued to shake it as long as it was a political reality practising systematic robbery and destruction on each other . History has named them the Border Reivers.Fraser explains in very well written words how the situation on the Borders came about . He describes the manner of people who lived there who were the leading robber families how they lived and ate and dressed and built their houses and so forth . He tells how the reivers practised such crimes as the protection racket robbery and cattle rustling . He also explains about the feuding that went on . He describes how Border law operated under the March Wardens and how the two governments tried to quell the reivers . Lastly the book tells how the reiving ended when England and Scotland came under one king and the older Borders ceased to be . ",4
"An interesting story well told about events along the border between England and Scotland . If you want to understand the to the foreigner confusing and somewhat comical mutual antipathy between the Scots and the English this is a very good place to start . ",3
"George MacDonald Fraser best known for the Flashman Papers shows he can write conventional history just as well . He is familiar with the culture geography history and legends of the border region and tells a complex story relatively clearly . The best sections are at the beginning and end of the book where he explains how the & # 8216reiving century & # 8217 came about at the end of the middle ages as the people of the English and Scottish marches became pawns in wider political conflict between the English and Scottish crowns and later how the age of the reivers was swiftly brought to a close by James I . In between the main conflicts are detailed in a scholarly and entertaining way but the overall context suffers a little as the repetitive back and forth raidings of Maxwells Johnstones Kerrs Armstrongs are picked over . The chronology of the period is a difficult one to master and only those who are already familiar with the key border events of the 16th Century will find it easy to navigate this book . Overall though a very good history of the Border Reivers . ",4
"I am an ardent student of history and particularly enjoy English and Scottish history from the period 13001750 . The author of this work is one of my favorites having read most of his Flashman novels of historical fiction . That being the case you would think that this work would be right in my wheelhouse . You would be wrong.Expecting interesting stories and histories of events along the EnglishScottish border I was instead confronted with a dry turgid scholarly treatise . Endless citing of English and Scottish village names multiple variations of spellings and name forms many times for the same person illegible maps and a complete lack of any semblance of organization leaves me mystified how on earth this book has garnered so many positive ratings . Does the author have so many relatives ? Most annoying is the author 's frequently employed tendency of directly quoting many of the actors in the history . You would think this would bring an authenticity and clarity to the dialogue but quite the opposite . For you see the denizens of the border did n't exactly speak the King 's English as you and I know it . For a good example read some Robert Burns and explain to me what it says . Page after page of quotations whose meaning can only be vaguely discerned by puzzling over context and possible meanings of words spelled only slightly similar to those with which you are familiar . Loads of enjoyment and enlightenment ensue.This is quite frankly one of the worst books I have ever read . ",0
"Before reading this biography all I knew about Oscar Wilde was that he was oversexed and the author of The Picture of Dorian Gray . Joseph Peace does a good job of revealing Wilde 's upbringing studies and career . In fact I am now reading and pondering other works of Wilde 's like De Profundis.The author seems harsh to Wilde 's lovers and most forgiving of the Wilde Life . The book paints a picture of Oscar Wilde as a gifted artist who as his life progressed became a moral degenirate and a drunkard in that order . Wilde apparently felt and even expressed remorse but seemed incapable of acting on it . Yes We have all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God . But that said Oscar Wilde was predatory in his pursuit of and obsession with younger men . As Pearce points out Wilde 's sin destroyed his family and destroyed him . Wilde died almost friendless and a pauper . Wilde did n't seem so much interested in love as he did in pleasure . What Wilde expressed on paper he was not capable of in himself . The book is an interesting study of the decadent movement of the 19th century in art and literature and will open the reader up to lesser known writers and artists who were Wilde 's contemporaries . Pearce does make the reader feel sad for Wilde as he was brilliantly talented but morally a train wreck . Over all not a bad read and a good introduction to the life of Oscar Wilde . ",3

"There seem to be two types of Oscar Wilde biographies . One treats him like a sexual martyr and hardly gets into his huge talents at all . The other talks only about his career and treats the episode with Lord Alfred Douglass like a spot on an otherwise pristine carpet . Jospeh Pearce refuses to take either path . He looks at Oscar Wilde the man the artist and the broken soul . Wilde had some ideas about himself and was like Herod fascinated by religion but was unable to stir himself to change . He a genius and was spoiled pampered and protected by his class and talent but that left him totally unprepared for a brute of a man like the Marquiss of Queensbury.Pearce is gentle with Wilde but he does n't excuse him . Wilde failed his wife and his sons miserably and the nameless faceless rent boys of London were n't just props they were shabbily used human beings . Pearce makes this all clear but he also discusses the hope of Wilde 's life his last minute conversion . Give this well written book a try . It is a completely different and fresh look at Oscar Wilde . ",3
"Pearce begins his book pompously I am convinced that this book penetrates to the very core of its subject . Yet rather than provide insight into Wilde as Pearce claims the book is only the Reader 's Digest version of Ellmann 's biography . If you are short on time and want an overview of Wilde 's life and work you could do worse . Just do n't expect perceptive analysis . ",0
"Wilde has a subtle and wicked sense of humour ! A good read for lovers of his works . I expected it to be one story but it was in fact a collection of short stories ",3
"Classic Oscar Wilde very witty bitting wonderful social commentary and entertaining . Well worth downloading and reading again . I 'm reading all of Oscar Wilde 's works and highly recommend them all . ",4
"Short stories are a wonderful genre and Oscar 's are as good as anyone 's well almost anyone 's . This one is clearly written and the ending is surprising . ",4
"A humorous story published as part of a collection of stories by Wilde in 1891 Lord Arthur Saville 's Crime and Other Stories .At Lady Windermere 's final reception before Easter at Bentinck House Lady Windermere 's chiromantist Mr. Podgers is quite a hit telling people about themselves and their fortunes.The chiromantist tells one Lord Arthur Saville that before he can marry his beloved he must murder a distant relative . What follows is a hilarious account of Lord Saville 's various failed attempts through poison explosives etc to do the deed before in despair he rather murders Mr. Podgers himself.A typically charming offbeat Wilde story with a twist in the tale . ",4
"i usually find Oscar Wilde 's stuff to be delightfully witty and wise . Parts of this were excellent very much up to his usual standard but most of this book was pretty forgettable . ",1
"Lord Saville one night listens to a chiromantist who tells him he has to commit a crime whose victim is supposed to be a relative of some kind before being able to marry his love . The tale is full of humor and shows how he fails systematically in his enterprise because he believes the soothsayer . But the more humoristic the tale becomes the more desperate Lord Saville grows . Till one night he kills the chiromantist . He has finally been able to rebel against the prediction and this rebellion proves the prediction is a fake . But a second dimension appears in the tale . The chiromantist had been introduced to Lord Saville by some woman who invites such oddities to her parties to amuse the audience . She behaves as if she believed in those ominous birds that she calls lions . And Lord Saville was naive enough to accept this prediction as true and unescapable because it had been introduced to him by this particular woman in this particular situation . Men must not fall in the traps of social tricks that some women hire to give some life to their social evenings that would be very dull otherwise . Who is wiser ? The woman who animates her social gatherings with such attractions ? Or the man who falls in the trap of believing such predictions ? The other tales of the collection are all just as funny by showing how some people are able to go beyond such appearances and reach another level of being that is some kind of game and it becomes a trap to the gullible ones.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University of Perpignan ",4
"I can never tire of reading Oscar Wilde . This collection of short stories is a must read . They show his humor wit and intelligence . ",4
"I truly enjoy most of Mr. Wilde 's writing . I enjoyed reading this . I have read most of Oscar 's stories and find most of them quite a good read . ",3
"Enjoyed this collection of Wilde 's short works . Very witty and really worth a read . Except perhaps for one about the mystery lady . ",4
"Oscar Wilde is such a great writer . These are wonderful stories especially the title one . I highly recommend this book . ",4
"Though thorough in an overview of the Tartan many family and clan Tartans listed in the Scottish registry are not included . Going to the website for the country of Scotland is much more complete . Interesting reading and such in it 's own way rather disappointing for what is written in the description . ",2
"My grandfather has a first edition 1938 copy of this in his collection I have have a 1960 much used and rebound twice version . It 's one I use at the first go to anytime I need a fast run down on a Clan or a Tartan this is what I pick up . Nifty wee book with punch ! Give the Clan Name in English and Gaelic Motto 's Old and Altered Clan Badge with description Origin on Clan Name Plant Badge War Cry and Pipe Music with full plate colour of their tartans and a surprisingly indepth mini history for each Clan.But that is not all ! It has a short history of Scotland from Origins moving into the development of the Clans the ranks within a Clan and various Customs . Has the Dress of the Tartan with several different examples . There is a Family and Clan name so you can see what Septs belong to what Clans A Scots History Time Line and even a mini ScotGaelic Glossary of Place Names and one of Heraldic Terms.For a wee book its size you can not believe all the information in it . A must for anyone wanting to know more about the tartans and the histories of the Highland Clans . ",4
"This is a classic everyone interested in tartans should have . There are an astounding number of editions available on Amazon at prices ranging from bargain basement cheap to investment level . I chose to buy an edition that I already had to replace a book that 's worn from loving use . The latter will be retired not tossed ! ",4
"This is very good resourse tool to use in identifing or finding a clan tartan . Brightly colored pictures & a history on each clan tartan is included . The book is well organized & easy to use . ",4
"excellent book I purchased this one as a replacement for one that I had several years ago an had misplaced . ",4
"Very goodlots of info on the Clans . Great for anyone interested in Scotland and it 's people ! I would recommend this to anyone who has any connection with the Scots . ",3
"This book focuses more on the why and how he took a photo than the technical stuff . Makes a great companion to his field guide.All of John Shaw 's books are great . There is some overlap between them as he goes over the basics but they are all worth a read for any aspiring nature photographer . ",4
"The book like brand new and shipped very fast I was impressed with this business.I would do business with them again . ",4
"If you are interested at all in nature photography you will enjoy and benefit from any of John Shaw 's works . Shaw is a clear concise writer as well as a great photographer . Focus On Nature is a wonderful indepth look at a meaningful approach to nature photography . In his usual friendly style Shaw teaches how to capture the environment as well as its wildlife and how to go beyond merely identifying headshots of animals . He makes a good point along with many others that since any photographer who can afford it can use a long lens the true challenge is to capture something much more meaningful . ",4
"Practical and well written book on how to improve one 's photographic technique . ",4
"Truly inspirational and provides valuable thoughts and insigths on the merging of art with the craft of photography . Invaluable tool and on a simple level great for staring . Could even be treated as a coffee table book ! ! ! ",4
"I was not impressed with this book.Very little technical data no data on many of the excellent images in the book.The writing was flowery and arty rather than concise with information to convey.If your looking for a book to teach you something I would not recommend this book.John Shaw 's Nature Photography book is however outstanding . ",0
"This book has everything you expect in a John Shaw book and more.While there are beautiful shots and a detailed descriptions of the equipment location and the time of that the photos where taken . The book is really more about the thought process that goes into the shot the hardware involved lighting lens focusing filters types framing and composition.The book also details the environment weather it 's a desert conditions or lush landscape time of day and time of season and how to handle lighting exposure and what types of filters to use based on this.He reminds us that sometimes there will be a good shot but patience will turn it into a great shot if you a willing to wait for light conditions to change . Look at your framing and composition and deciding what elements to emphasize and what to leave out or minimize . Practicing good stewardship of the environment and making sure to leave things as you found them.The photography in Focus on nature is breath taking as always . While the book predates digital media it does not detract in any from the book because with the exception of the discussion of film everything else is applicable to the digital and film photographer.The book cover to cover is higloss paper and all photos are in color and ohso vibrant.I own several of Johns books and I would have to say that alll are outstanding and this is no exception.5 stars and then some . ",4
"John Shaw is an amazing photographer . This is the third book of his that I have bought . What helpful hints though I wish that he was using Canon instead of NikonI will continue to use his many wondeful ideas.I hope that he keeps the great books coming . ",4
"Beautiful pictures and the lens and fstop are included along with an explanation of the photograph . It was one of my best photography book purchases . ",4
"All of John Shaws books are thoughtfull well written and aesthetically valuable . This one is specifically oriented towards Shaws photographic values i.e . what is his view of how to photograph nature . What I took away from reading Focus on Nature was the abstract sense of how Shaw dedicates his techniques to achieving high quality photographs . This book does not teach creativity however . That is up to the individual . ",2
"The year was 1995 . Irish music was wildly popular in the United States spurring many to learn something of the Irish language . Luckily Collins came out with this Gem pocket dictionary EnglishIrish and IrishEnglish to serve these thousands of new learners . It 's a substantial dictionary with 40000 references and 60000 translations . Not only are single lexical items defined but idioms containing them are frequently given as well . In between the EnglishIrish and IrishEnglish sections there 's a 27page sketch of Irish grammar mainly conjugations and declensions.Though I never reached a fluent command of Irish I have productively used the dictionary over the years to understand Irish words and short sentences in the linguistics texts I have worked with . However a major downside of the dictionary as other reviewers have already commented is that it does not give the pronunciation of Irish words with phonetic transcription . The orthography of Irish is idiosyncratic to say the least . Without phonetic transcription you can not be completely sure how a word is pronounced . This makes the dictionary less than ideal for selfteaching learners who do not have constant access to a native speaker who can pronounce the words.Nonetheless this little dictionary is economical and widely represented on the used market . While the paper on my copy has yellowed somewhat it has not become brittle and the vinyl cover has stood up well . Seek a copy out if you are interested in Irish . ",2
"While this dictionary covers many Irish words I most dislike it because it has NO pronunciations . It gives you all these wonderful Irish words but no way to know how they 're pronounced unless you have a hefty grip on Irish pronunciations already . It is not a dictionary for beginners . ",1
"A bucketload of words in a small format . If you need pronunciation and grammar though this is not for you . It is what it says a dictionary not a howto book . But if you are learning Irish this is a great reference to have just like your Webster 's and Roget 's . ",4
"What is good about Collins Gem ? Well there are modern terms for modern things many probably only coined for this dictionary . Not all of them are very good but most are good enough . Sometimes I have been somewhat irritated that the book has not utilised the terminology found in Focl & oacuteir scoile and Focl & oacuteir P & oacuteca extensively enough . Besides the choice of entries has more to do with UK and Northern Ireland than with Ireland . And it is not only more obscure words that are n't found the EnglishIrish section often does n't have even quite common or everyday words . It looks alas that there really is n't a quite satisfactory pocket dictionary of Irish . If the Langenscheidt team would try it they would probably be able to compile one very good pocket dictionary by combining this with Focl & oacuteir Scoile . ",2
"This is a good book with lots of words packaged into a small space . I have run into words that I could n't find in this book though . However if you are a serious student of any language you know that you can never make do with just one dictionary . I typically have about three or four dictionaries per language . Crossreference your dictionaries to make sure you are getting the nuance you want from the word I once heard a girl ask for facil queso ! No no no ! Sorry about the Spanish reference in the middle of an Irish review . It 's the point that counts though..This is a good dictionary for having on your shelf full of dictionaries . ",4
"Collins Gem Irish Dictionary editors S & eacuteamus Mac Math & uacutena and Ailbhe O ' Corr & aacutein is a user friendly comprehensive uptodate wordlist of EnglishIrish to IrishEnglish . It 's a dictionary for looking up words just like the Webster or the Oxford . It does NOT contain any pronunciations of the words in Irish . It does contain abbrevations . The middle section is useful Irish grammar that includes extensive tables of regular and irregular verbs and noun declensions and key English words makes it an invaluable reference tool . The back section contains numbers used in counting and with nouns and time.If you are learning to speak the Irish Gaelic language I 'd recommended you to try a lesson course with book that has pronunciations and a cassette to follow along . Some tips would be 'Learning Irish ' by Micheal O'Siadhail 'Irish Grammar ' by Noel Mogonagle and 'Irish on Your Own ' by Eamon O'Donaill . Some of these can help on the basics of learning the language . This compact source is handy to carry around with you if you 're traveling . It seems to sell fairly well in Ireland where I got my copy while in Dublin . My other option to learning the language is to take a course well in a creditable school that teaches it . Also check through Eason & amp Sons in Ireland for Gaelic textbooks . Eason.ie is an excellent source in Irish books . ",3
"This is an average dictionary . It has lots of words but is virtually USELESS if you intend on speaking Gaelic as it has NO PRONUNCIATIONS FOR ANY WORDS.Do not buy this book if you are attempting to speak Gaelic . You will be thoroughly disappointed . If however you only want to look up Gaelic words and find out what they mean then it will do the job for you . ",1
"The COLLINS GEM LATIN DICTIONARY is a superb little dictionary that is superior to even other language dictionaries in the Collins Gem series . It is both a Latin English and English Latin dictionary and includes several appendices on terminology of Roman cultural matters.The LatinEnglish portion contains nearly all words the high school student or undergrad are likely to come across . It is followed by a brief summary of Latin grammar and verse . The grammar is sufficient only for students of the most basic level of competency in Latin but the explanation of verse is insightful and will satisfy even higherlevel students . The appendix of placenames in Latin and their equivalents in English is a godsend for students who can handle texts just fine except for placenames which are missing from many larger resources.One caveat is that the dictionary seems a little too large if one is not going to be using the English Latin section . High school students and university students taking a course in Latin composition will find this section most helpful . Those whose use of a Latin dictionary is limited to deciphering problematic words in an otherwise clearly readable text will find an entire half of the dictionary to be unnecessary and may resent the larger size of what could be an ideally compact dictionary.For beginning students of Latin the COLLINS GEM LATIN DICTIONARY is the dictionary to get . It is not ideal for higher level study but students with a few years of experience should have already invested in a copy of LEWIS & amp SHORT 'S LATIN DICTIONARY . ",4
"Collins Gem Latin Dictionary is an excellent choice for anyone interested in Latin . Wether you 're a Latin I or a Latin III student it does not matter . This small book measuring 3in by 4 12in can fit into almost any pocket & amp can be carried almost anywhere . These small books were common currency in my Latin class & amp were highly recommended by the teacher . This Latin Dictionary also proves to be very durable . I once spilled water on the cover & amp to my surprise it did not leak through . Not only does this dictionary translate LatinEnglish & amp EnglishLatin but in the back of the book is a list of key Roman dates 7 kings of Rome cardinalordinaldistributiveadverb forms of the numbers measuring units money Greek & amp Roman & amp geographic names .

"Not only does this dictionary have a more complete variety of words than many but it also contains a number of helpful proper nouns which come in handy when reading a text which is heavy in allusions . The little grammar and verse section also is a good resource to have around if something slips your mind . Using this I 've never even thoughts about buying a bigger dictionary since this has so much of what I need . ",4
"This small dictionary is surely the best choice for the beginners of Latin . The explainations are easy & amp clear and you can find most words you need as a beginner . I 'm studying with Oxford Latin 1 and The Complete idiot 's guide.. With both books this dictionary worked very well . Also as its small you can have it around you all the time which is really important . I may need another bigger one if I study Latin more deeply but at the moment I am VERY satisfied . ",4
"This little book has as many words and definitions as most of the larger and more expensive works . It may not look impressive on the old bookshelf but it is a very useful and afordable dictionary . ",4
"This surprisingly small dictionary has so far included definitions of every word I 've needed to look up through the completion of a firstyear Latin course . Irregular forms are typically listed separately which is especially critical for those of us still struggling with Latin 's abundant irregular verbs . Many proper names are also included which is useful in recognizing their sometimes unpredictable declensions . The grammer and versification sections are too rudimentary to be of much help but conversely they take up very little space . Although the book is physically small think gem the typeface is a usuerfriendly size and font . ",4
"This is a very small book only 4 x 2.5 x 2inches at best . You may need a magnifying glass to read the tiny print . Lookup entry is often a single word can be misleading . Not a friendly companion when reading latin . ",1
"The above Latin expression translated means Wisdom Lies Within You Know Yourself . Never a more true statement . In todays ' world full of modern equipment cellular phones email fast food and instant everything we have long forgotten an older language an older form of communication that has not truly disappeared from our vocabulary .

Although you will not find any person speaking Latin at an office at a school or universityperhaps at a university but that 's an exception you will not be surprised to discover that the roots of most Western languages are based on Latin . These include Spanish Portuguese and Italian Italian being the closest language to Latin . This dictionary provides a surplus of Latin words and phrases that will make you a Latin speaker in no time . Five Stars . But only for the serious minded . ",4
"When this dictionary came in the mail I was dismayed at the tiny size . Having studied French Spanish and Korean in the past I thought dictionaries had to be huge to be useful . So I stuck it on the shelf.Then I came to a word I wanted a bit more information on picked up this book and was very pleasantly surprised . I 've literally kept it at my right side whenever studying my Latin ever since then .

"With store shelves overloaded by SAS books it 's unfortunate that this little uh Gem can be lost in that crowd . The original format was more like a coffee table book but for practical purposes this chunky compact edition is not only the most convenient of those available it is also arguably the best on the market.The manual itself is comprehensive clearly written and with clear if sometimes limited illustrations including a useful colour section and here the colour is used for more than mere decoration as it provides essential additional information in identifying plants and animals . There is no philosophical description here little room for the romance of the wild or the ethics of surviving . Instead Lofty Wiseman 's guide is a direct parcel of solid information aimed solely at keeping you alive in the worst of situations . Campers and outdoorsmen will find some interesting and useful sections here but it requires a degree of knowledge and experience to sift them from those which simply must not be used outside of an emergency . This is a fascinating book to dip into and doubtless most purchasers treat it as such but it is also an exceptionally effective reliable and wellcrafted source of possibly vital information . ",4
"Outstanding in price size and content . Few books have been more useful to me or resourceful . Really it covers every possible situation and because of the afore mentioned size it can go just about everywhere with you . Campers survivalists antigovernmental extremists wan na be hunters and gatherers will all find this little baby an amazing repository of highly useful and to the point information . This thing even covers emergency childbirth for crying out loud ! How can you go wrong ? So while other suckers are starving to death dying of thirst or being eaten by sharks you 'll be relaxing and thinking about what you 're going to do when you get home . Brilliant . ",4
"There is lots to love about this book its tiny size the quality printing and illustrations and the firstrate outdoor living information throughout . It uses color especially well in the plant and insect identification section . It 's loaded with improvisational survival tips . For example I palm sap from young stalks is an easy source of essential water and sugar a baited cloth bag can catch eels unattended overnight . One nit the tome lacks an index and given it 's 380 pages one is definitely needed . Still I give it five stars and consider this book essential for any outdoors person . ",4
"Delphi has become my first choice when purchasing collected works of authors and their Oscar Wilde collection is one of several I have purchased from them . I can get public domain works for free so a seller has to offer something more to convince me to pay for something I could get free . As with Delphi 's other collections this is a first rate product . The works are in one folder which makes my Kindle library more manageable but other sellers offer that convenience . The comprehensive complete public domain contents active table of contents numerous photographs numerous illustrations biographical information contextual notes low price ability to receive upgrades etc . set Delphi 's collections apart and make them a bargain . The buyer who constantly gives Delphi onestar reviews must have a personal vendetta because the product is definitely deserving of 5 stars by any objective standards . Collections where copyright laws prevent inclusion of an author 's total oeuvre are as complete as legally possible and this is not the seller 's fault and is not a fraud . The seller clearly states that nonpublic domain works are not included . The collections are still a bargain and one can always supplement them by filling in the gaps from other sources . I hope Delphi continues to add more authors to their catalogue because I prefer their collections to anyone else 's . As for the works themselves this is Oscar Wilde and that says it allfive stars !

"I 've become a fan of this writer and it 's great to have so much in such a small digital package . Kindle books take very little space in my Tablet . Some times like vacations and business trips it 's a good thing to have an entire library tag along . ",4
"Oscar Wilde was a selfdescribed man of paradox . He was simultaneously a man very much of his time and also very ahead of his time . He was a highly moral man who wrote clever epigrams about how good it is to be wicked Wickedness is a myth invented by good people to account for the curious attractiveness of others . He was a happily married man who happily loved his two children but also led a gay life on the side and wrote hilarous satires of love and marriage Men marry because they are tired women because they are curious both are disappointed . This huge book which contains practically everything that Wilde ever wrote shows the man in all his glory . After the introduction by his son we are first launched into Oscar 's stories . His one novel The Picture of Dorian Gray is a classic and a masterpiece . A devastating moral tale this one deserves to be in everyone 's library . His shorter pieces however are of a more questionable quality . Consisting mostly of moral ancedotes dressed up in the thinlyveiled guise of fairy tales for children these works are the least exciting part of Wilde 's oeuvre and of this book and seem to lean heavily on his oftspouted crutch of Art for Art 's sake . After the stories we meet Wilde in the guise he was destined for that of a dramatist . His play were an integral and ackwnoledged part of his genius and their influence upon modern drama was enormous . His type of high farcial drawing room comedy has left a permanent mark on the stage . It is easy to see how even the modern Hollywood sitcom sprung from these plays of Wilde 's . However funny and biting the satire may be though the high point of Oscar Wilde 's plays was always his epigramlaced dialogue whatever the plot may be . Probably the finest and most biting aphorist the English language has ever produced Wilde is probably quoted whether people realize it or not more often than any other source in the language aside from The Bible and Shakespeare . The Importance of Being Earnest and Salome are his ackwnoledged masterpieces but other plays such as A Woman of No Importance and An Ideal Husband are very good plays as well . He also has some very fine and underrated less original works such as The Duchess of Padua that are quite well worth reading . From here we move into Wilde 's poems . Although as he himself admits they sometimes contain more rhyme than reason there is no doubting that Wilde was a master of language and a fine poet . He won the Newdigate Prize for Poetry while at Oxford and his Ballad of Reading Gaol is one of the finest poems in existence . What 's left are his essays and letters . The most famous of them indeed one of the most famous letters ever written is De Profundis his strangely moving and tragic lovehate letter to Lord Alfred Douglas from prison . This is a shocking and immensely moving piece of work and deserves to be read by one and all for its unique look into the human psyche particuarly that of a man under intense suffering and possibly on the brink . The letter is fascinating and should put a different spin on Wilde than many people inaccurately have of the man he was obviously of a very high moral character . Several interesting essays are also included among them are The Critic As Artist and The Decay of Lying two masterful pieces of Platoistic dialogue putting Wilde 's severe wit and intimidating intellectualism on full display for all to see . One may wonder how much he actually believes of what he writes but what he writes is brilliant . Another interesting essay is The Portrait of Mr. W.H . in which Wilde puts forth an interesting and unique theory about Shakespeare 's sonnets . Also while Wilde was not generally known for his political opinions it is quite interesting to read his essay on political and social reform The Soul of Man Under Socialism as well as two letters he wrote about proposed reformations of the prison system.All in all this is a collection of masterful writings from one of the most tragically overlooked and underrated writers in the whole of literature . As another reviewer has pointed out while Wilde rarely gets the credit he deserves for his work and is often ignored overlooked or simply dismissed his works are also widely and frequently plagarised not to mention quoted legitimately and were obviously extremely influential . You owe it to yourself to read the man 's writings if you are not familar with his works I guarantee you you wo n't regret it . ",4
"If I am in a bad mood Oscar Wilde will pull me out . I have missed subway stops and stayed up too late rereading his wonderful works . Be they hysterically funny gutwrenchingly sad or simply depressing the writing is so brilliant I am always drawn to a higher plane .

"He did n't write that much so it 's easy enough to ownand readit all . And it 's all worth reading . I particularly like his literary criticism which is just as entertaining as his fiction and drama . Sure you can pick and choose and it 's easier to read Earnest in a slimmer edition . But eventually trust me you will want it all . ",4
"Oscar Wilde is a genius . His social satire is as crisp and hilarious as it was when it first appeared . He is one of the very first literary loves of my life . I was reading his stuff before I even understood many of the references while still loving his sharp language and witty repartee ! This is an excellent collection of his works really welldone and welledited . I highly recommend him . ",4
"No comments..it 's a classic ! ! His tales were specially touching to me . Everybody should read at least these just to start understanding Mr. Wilde 's personality . ",4
"Hi ! Curious thing about Oscar Wilde is that although he is frequently underrated ignored trivialized forgotten or simply dismissed his works are also widely and frequently plagiarized . Not that he would care too much about that if he were alive.This book is a great collection of literary works by one of the greatest writers in the English language . Ranging from prose fairy tales and drama through poetry to social commentary . This book has something for almost everyone it is a great companion on long journeys and a breath of fresh air compared with some of the stale and stagnant ruminations of many an airport paperback hero.Try it ! it 's good for the soul and the mind.regards ",4
"I should write another review for Edgar Allan Poe sometime I frequently refer to both Poe and Wilde as The Manbut first Oscar Wilde 's anthology.Wow I 've probably still more than half of this collection to get through though I 've read De Profundis Mr. Wilde 's 80page letter to Bosie written while he was in prison several times . Over and over from beginning to end and for some reason it gets better and better with each read.As Oscar Wilde states himself is there a more brilliant wit to quote ? If one can not enjoy reading a book over and over again there is no use in reading it at all.I 've read some of the poems as well as The Canterville Ghost and The Portrait of Dorian GrayI look forward to rereading those and discovering the gems I 've missed so far ! ",4
"Not a fan of reading plays . For me too difficult to read . But I do like Oscar Wilde 's works as watched either on the stage or screen . ",2
"The Complete Works of Irish poet Oscar Wilde which is published by Collins is a must for a private library . It is an excellent book even if you only want to check one of Wilde 's witty quotes and there are plenty . The book includes Wilde 's only novel The Picture of Dorian Gray which caused a findesiecle scandal about a century ago because of its underlying homoeroticism . There are also all his famous plays which he wrote and was loved for by English society such as The Importance of Being Earnest An Ideal Husband as well as Lady Windermere 's Fan . In addition there are stories poems such as The Ballad of Reading Gaol the jail he had to go to for his affair with Bosie Douglas essays and letters such as De Profundis . This newly illustrated centenary edition also incorporates recent revisions to the text which probably only experts will spot . ",4
"Oscar Wilde can turn a phrase and write a double entendre like few others . And he is hilarious . Like Twain he can point out our foibles and failings make us cast our eyes down or laugh aloud or make us cry . A man of flesh and blood and intellect a man whose life was success and failure applause and scandal he could wring every emotion from his audience having experienced them himself . Read him and weep . And laugh . ",4

"Though the print is small for those of us over 40 it 's worth it if not it would weigh about 10 pounds ! As it is it 's a tome but worth reading and rereading time and again .

"I used this dictionary when I was teaching myself Portuguese . It is definitely not the best there is but it 's very good considering its size and portability.I especially like how it highlights both Lusitanian and Brazilian Portuguese . Although I do n't like how it uses mainly British English . That makes it hard for American students to look up a word . I think it would 've benefitted more from having both American and British English listed.One of the best things about this dictionary is its portability . It 's so small it can fit in your coat pocket without a proble . Another thing I like is its pronunciation guide at the beginning complete with IPA.A very useful tool to your Portuguese mastery . I also recommend Essential Portuguese Grammar to go along with this dictionary.Brandon Simpson ",4

"Collins makes great pocket dictionaries . They have a handheld version of their Spanish Pocket Gem that sets the bar for handheld dictionaries so buying the Portuguese Pocket Gem paperback was a nobrainer.It lists colloquialism slang pejoratives sets important words off from others with bolding has verb tables in the back has a pronounciation guide for both Continental and Brazilian Portuguese as well as English so Portuguese speakers can find the book useful as well and so much more.The translations and definitions are very accurate and extremely helpful and the pronounciation of each word is essential to students of either language.An exemplary representative of the Gem dictionary series .

"This is a VERY tiny dictionary which makes it very difficult to read . It also is geared toward British English which further limits its usefulness for American readers . It is compact and plastic bound which does make it a true pocket sized book but if you are looking for readability and overall usefulness I would look a bit further . ",1
"This dictionary has two major virtues a it is really small b it 's not paperback but rather plasticback the jacket is of a reasonably resistant plastic material . I have n't found any dictionary of similar size that is as solid .

"I 've owned a Collins gem Portuguese dictionary since the 1970 's . I have carried it for years when I needed it . I have worn off half the cover from use . Yet the binding is still intact and there are no loose pages so you know it is of good quality . The 4th edition is the current edition.Having used all the various editions and still using them all as I keep one in various places at homeoffice etc . I can compare the strengths and weaknesses.First of all the Collins gem dictionary is the best portable dictionary around . I have used or examined all of the others and thrown or given them away because the Collins is the best . It is written clearly has the most words and contains as much information as possible for a small book . It is truly pocket size meaning it will fit in your shirt pocket . Over the years it has gotten a little thicker due to more words more definitions of each word and thicker paper . I personally think it 's about a half inch too thick to be really comfortable in my shirt pocket but unless you can find an older thinner version with the onion skin paper this is the best you can do . I do have concern that the newer thicker paper might not wear as well . The onion skin paper seems to hold up better in my 50 year old Bible and I wonder if this new paper will be as durable . I guess I 'll find out in another 3050 yearsThis edition 4th has a plasticized cover so it wo n't break down like my 30 year old copy . It also has more entries under each word . For example a common verb like the English run has dozens of definitions . It would be impossible to list them all in a pocket dictionary but the latest editions have more than the earlier editions . This makes it more likely to get an accurate translation of a word . This edition also has better explanatory pages listing verb conjugations and the like . Unless you could already conjugate ser to be how would you otherwise know that seja fui and foram were all forms of ser ? However the dictionary still only lists see verb ser under these conjugations . There is plenty of room on the line next to fui to define it I was rather than just refer to another page . But it continues to improve over the years.For more formal translation work or to use on archaic literature I use a more complete dictionary Novo Michaelis . Its 2 volumes are about 18 inches thick and anything but portable however.I recommend getting books from the US or Europe rather than Brazil . Brazil though fairly literate has the lowest number of bookstores in the developed world per capita . This lack of a market means that the incountry publications are of poor quality and poorly edited and proofread . I rarely saw books in a Brazilian home unless they were schoolbooks sciptures pornography or in a teacher or intellectuals house . Lately Brazilian publishers have taken to just publishing crooked photocopies that are often unreadable in their books and it can be difficult to even find a brand new book that does n't already have a broken binding or loose pages.For travel or ordinary translation needs this will serve quite well and though I am quite fluent in Portuguese I still use this most often when I need help to translate some literary word I have forgotten or never learned . Highly recommended from this user of 30 years . ",3

"This paperback edition of the Jane 's series is a major feat . Jane 's takes all of the available information and some errors which are unforgiveable whips them together with standard stock photos and presto makes a WORKABLE basic guide to modern armor . There are ommissions and very poor editorial control all over the place . I wish that Jane 's would have spent more time with the book . Many if not all of the pictures are the same in Tanks of The World by David Miller . I was surprised by the number of wheeled armored vehicles in this book . Not great but good . ",3

"I 'll confess being an early purchaser of most books Christopher Foss admits to authoring .

It 's best value is that of a starter book for those who formulate their opinions based on awareness of how lethal the world remains . Many people have an absolute interest or need to recognize how nations defend themselves and with what and from whom ! For the military professional the guide 's shortcomings on poor editing weapons potential maintenance problems rate of fire et al may disappoint my technical intelligence friends and still leave average readers bored silly with uninteresting detail . One might find this book in competition with military database sites on the Web.The Web offers many sites with staggering amounts of data . I find many websites hard to use other than for quick lookups some sites having poor internal search engines some are not up to date others expouse political agendas I 'd rather not support or have as many if not more incorrect data than does this book ! Welcome to the world of intelligence ! .Viewed as an entry level guide to a very complex subject one can come away from this book with a great appreciation of the staggering size of the international arms industry the great proliferation of arms and the technical innovations that drives fierce competition between countries and manufacturers not only for technical superiority but for international sales = survival of arms manufacturers . Jane 's has had great commercial success with this series and for good reason . It delivers broad appeal to a wide audience.Good marks for1 . Color photographs in later published versions2 .

They left out complete battlefield operating systems such as track mounted AD weaponry etc2 . Some embarassing editing errors mentioned in great detail by other reviewers.3 . They mixed paramilitary and police equipment riot control and police vehicles with military vehicle categories .

Great reference book for anyone interested in modern AFV's.However there is a major omission as the book states it contains Self Propelled AntiAircraft systems but they are not included in the book . An obvious error that should be corrected either by including them in a future edition or removing mention of them being included on the back cover 2000 edition also has this same error.Only reason for the 3 star rating . Otherwise the book is well worth the price and has a mountain of detailed info statistics color photos & diagrams on most all of the AFV 's being used around the world today . ",2
"Upon my discovery that ALL my neighbors are practicing LuciferiansSatanists I ordered a different book by Dr. Burns and given she is so thorough in her research I ordered this one as well . Strange incidents have been happening to me and around the neighborhood for years but I could never place a finger on the cause . Sure I thought my neighbors were a bit off but it seems so many people are off these days I stupidly excused and rationalized their behavior . Then about a year ago one of neighbor ladies said her grandmother had been an Eastern Star . End of the story ? After experiencing drama I wo n't go into here I am now a bornagain Christian and fight their witchcraft sorcery etc . with spiritual warfare in these biblical End Times . Most importantly Christians must stay in the Word of God as we fight the good fight . Thank you Dr. Burns . ",4
"If you are a fundamentalist Christian you might love this book because it will feed that selfrighteous attitude of intolerance that many Christians have for everyone who does not believe exactly as they do ! If you are not a Christian you may be offended by the arrogant judgmental holierthan thou attitude that the author portrays . However the information in this book is fascinating ! If you are a Brother or Sister of The Order you will either be offended or amused at this pitiful attempt to discredit and slander an organization that is rich with history knowledge and wisdom.Sadly the author is so thoroughly brainwashed by a modern religion that was designed to control the masses that she can not see past the profane exoteric levels of the symbolism of Freemasonry and OES . She cites that pompus moron Anton LeVay who invented his own religion and used it to perpetrate lies myths and half truths in his socalled Satanic Bible back in the 1960 's . Freemasonry is a lot older than that and the symbolism of Freemasonry and OES have NOTHING to do with that nutjob LaVey ! I gave this book a 4 star rating simply because the book is well researched and I enjoyed reading it . And also because it had the opposite effect than the author intended which was to convince people to leave the OES or refrain from joining OES.I find the symbolism of Freemasonry and OES very fascinating and educated myself on the multilayered meanings that the symbols have . masonry is rich with history and symbolism carried over from ancient times . Freemasonry is a beautiful testament to our ancestors and our cultural roots and represents and encompasses all the religions and beliefs . All religions come from a single source and nothing presents that in a more respectful and compassionate way than Freemasonry ! Peace to ALL ",3
"Because it did not let you look in the book you were not able to see and get a feel for the book which is not a great book so I beleive that is why they did not let you get a peek before buying . I would not recommend this book . ",0
"This book is written more on the reference type . It has a lot of informative reading that is very true . It is not a book for reading cover to coverIt 's worth the reading not very exciting though . ",2
"The author obviously has not done her research has no history or understanding of the organization . She views Eastern Star the Masonic organization and many others as satanic based . She obviously is activily involved in them to have such a profound understanding of their inner working NOT . ",0
"One negative is that this book at times seems to deal with Freemasonry more than OES . But then again it 's understandable why the author had to spend so much time on the Freemasonry angle . A key part of this book is to show that OES and Freemasonry are intimately connected . Then she shows that Masonry has demonicoccult roots thus OES also has occulticdemonic roots by being an outgrowth of Freemasonry.The parts that deal mainly with OES are interesting . But the parts dealing with the occultic roots of Freemasonry are absolutely riveting . The book 's hundreds of footnotes show that the author put a lot of effort into putting this book together.Of course hardcore masons and the like will hate this book for the most part . Those who are open enough to read this book from cover to cover might find this book eyeopening as I did . This book is written from a Christian antiMasonic perspective so those coming from that perspective will find this book most useful . ",3
"If you are a guy with testicles you will like this book . The epic describes the adventures of a Viking Orm from his youth up until his last expedition . He never stays in one place for too long and is pretty much on the search for blood the the span of his lifetime . The only drawback to this book is the prattling priest who tries to soften and dull the plot of Orm 's awesome life . Push through the nagging priest part about 34 through the book and you will find more bloody skulls on the other side . This is one of my favorite books of all time . It immerses you and you start to think like the author writes because he writes in a slightly different way than we speak now . It does wonders for the brain to see this new kind of sentence structure . I think my brain grew from reading this book . The LongShips is inspiring it makes you want to squeeze every last drop of adventure out of life as possible to greet every stranger that walks in your path befriend him and exploit him until your name is written with his blood on the Hall of Eternity .

"The Long Ships is an epic adventure in the telling and the reading . This hard to put down novel traces the life of Orm a monumental Viking leader as he honorably battles the numerous enemies . Within these pages we learn the code of the Norsemen their honor and their formidable fighting ways . But all is not grimly told for there are flashes of humor or at least what passes for Viking humor . For example in the Viking view a good fight to the death of one or both of the participants is certainly a worthy undertaking . Also if one flags at the task of rowing one of the long boats then it is sensible to throw the slacker overboard . After reading this saga it is easy to understand why Norsemen were the rulers of Northern Europe for several centuries . A great read . Enjoy ",4
"This book is a wonderful discovery as it combines every feature I love in fine literature.It is an heroic adventure and coming of age story that excites the boy in me . Especially in the first book our hero travels far and wide to discover the world and himself.It is an historical novel that introduced me to an era and world that I had not discovered . The primitive Danes and Swedes venture out for booty from richer and more civilized lands . The advanced Moors of Spain teach their northern captives the pleasures of wealth and culture . The hapless Irish and English fall victim to the ferocious Swedes but turn the tables by influencing the primitives souls . The pull of Christianity slowly spreads through the primitive land of the Swedes replacing their sylvan primitivism . And finally the little known incursions of the Northmen into Russia are described.It is a discussion of what it means to be advanced and civilized . Written in the shadow of the Nazi invasion it is a reflection on the nature of savagery and the meaning of Christian tolerance.This book deserves to be read by many young and old . ",4
"Much fighting and raiding and adventuring . The sensibility of these 10th century Scandinavians is not quite contemporary but not inexplicable either . There is deadpan humor that is delicious . Read this and skip the horrible cable TV series Vikings . ",4
"The Long Ships is a Viking saga of the highest order . I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book . I 've read some Viking era history and fiction and found this book to be quite accurate to how I imagined the period . Red Orm is a likeable character and I could n't wait to see how his story ended . The four parts of the book made for good dividing points and good breaks in the story line.Orm is captured during a raid when a young man and forced to row on a Viking ship to take the place of the man he killed . Once he becomes accepted by the crew his ship is captured by Muslim pirates and he is becomes a galley slave . Eventually he is released and entered the service of Almunsar of Spain as a member of his personal bodyguard . When an opportunity arises Orm and his remaining crewmates escape and return home as rich men with weapons and gold . For a time he enters the service of King Harald and he even goes to England as part of an invading force . Towards the end of the book he travels to Kiev on a quest to recover a lost trove of Bulgar gold.As a Viking tale there is plenty of sailing rowing plunder sword fighting romance and religion . The religious context interested me a lot . Orm is transformed from a young boy believing in traditional Northern gods to a valuable soldier for a Muslim world leader and finally became a Christian in order to marry . He followed Allah when it benefited him and when he was in Allah 's waters and later when he tries to convert his friend to Christianity he mixes up his theologies . He became an off the cuff Christian and decided that Jesus made him lucky . As the book progresses he has a priest as a best friend and doctor but he does n't force Christianity on his friends . He builds a church but still held on to many of the old ways.In conclusion to echo Chambon 's introduction it is really good . I was swept up in the tale and felt like a shipmate on board ready for an adventure . I wish Orm had more adventures so that the book would have lasted longer . Definitely one I 'll return to again .

"What a fun read ! It had everything Vikings lost treasure sword fights exotic travel pirates and starcrossed love . The writing in this translation was light hearted and fast moving . Recommended for fans of light historical fiction like the Horatio Hornblower books or Princess Bride . ",4
"I loved this book and did not want it to end . I had read all the negative reviews and considered not getting it but the price was right so I did . I am very glad that I did . My only complaint is that I wanted a MAP to show where he went . I could figure out some of the places but not the ScandinavianBaltic ones . ",4
"I heartily endorse all of the accolades heaped upon this novel by the other reviewers . It is a rollicking good tale chock full of more adventure per page than any other book I can think of . A good measure of ironic humor adds to the fun.However the potential reader deserves a few observations absent from the other reviews.1 . Episodic The book is basically a fictional biography of Orm which recounts his many violent military adventures . In most cases Orm is the aggressor . Although some conflicts do arise as revenge for previous battles most are stand alone events and could have occurred in any random order . Like most serialized TV series or movie serials from the 1950s each adventure is pretty much unrelated to the others except that usually the same protagonists fight different enemies . Of the 50 or so adventures at least half a dozen are accounts by third parties that Orm meets who tell the story of their own adventures.I say this to contrast the Long Ships to other sweeping novels that some other reviewers have compared it to such as The Count of Monte Christo or Les Miserables . These novels also include many adventures but they all are integrated within a single overarching conflict which organizes the entire story and gives it compelling moral force . Since these novels merit 5 stars I have to give the Long Ships only 4.5.2 . Anachronistic Often historical novels fascinate by helping us to wonder how people in the distant past thought the way they did . How did the Greeks and Romans produce wonderful poetry yet practice slavery and ritual murder ? What attitudes do we have today that will be similarly scorned by future generations ? To be believable it helps if the author attempts to convey the way these figures may have actually talked and thought . But in the Long Ships the characters speak with a clarity of thought and introspection that modern men seldom attain even in written communication . The contents of their thought and attitudes are foreign to us but their style of communication seems much too modern to be believable . It may be funny and charming to hear talk of raping and pillaging spoken like Victorian gentlemen at their tea but more realism is usually necessary for the suspension of disbelief . I suspect actual Vikings spoke and thought more like modern biker gang members . But them the humor would disappear.3 . Narrow Focus I admire historical novelists Patrick O'Brien comes to mind who attempt to infuse all aspects of daily life into their stories . Here the long ships comes up short . There is plenty of what we would today call politics sex religion and violence . But never a mention for example of how a long ship was built or who built them.4 . Satire on Religion The story of the Long Ships occurs during the period when attempts were being made to convert the Vikings to Christianity . Many do become Christians but their reasons for doing so are just as silly as the old pagan superstitions they had before . Often they keep both sets of belief . This thread of satire is woven throughout the novel to great comic affect.Enjoy . ",3
"Loved the characters and learning more about a time in history I had heard about but knew little of . A good book ! ",2
"English literature began with a Viking story Beowulf but have you ever tried reading it ? My own Beowulf experience led me to believe Viking literature is right down there with Viking cuisine in terms of digestibility . Imagine my surprise when I discovered a novel about Vikings written over half a century ago to be as thrilling fantastic and engaging as The Long Ships.It 's the story of Orm a farmer 's son in southern Sweden in the late 900s who one day finds himself a prisoner of a merry gang of Vikings . They quickly adopt him and set out for adventures off the northern and southern coasts of Europe . Before the book is half over Orm has found himself in courts from Spain to England espoused three different religions slain several dozen foemen and found a princess to be his bride.Frans G. Bengtsson 's novel originally published in Sweden in 1945 showcases two things I did n't expect from a Scandinavian academic brevity and humor . Sure the book is nearly 500 pages long but Bengtsson crams a lot of incident in every page describing events in broad strokes and letting the reader 's imagination do the rest . Bengtsson 's style preserved marvelously by Michael Meyer 's 1954 translation is to consciously evoke the elliptical prose of ancient Viking sagas but in such a way as to allow for a modern tongueincheek sensibility to come through one that reflects a Viking world however hardbitten of great wit and depth.The Long Ships is marvelously quotable For no man complains of the weight of the cargo when it is his own booty that is putting strain upon the oars . Or Only poets can win wealth with empty hands but then they must make better songs than other poets and competition spoils the pleasure of composition.The book jacket includes an enthusiastic reviewer describing mansize helpings of battle and murder robbery and rape which captures some of the tone of Long Ships but misses most of the point . Orm is no savage bandit but a thoughtful evolving character of great honor . The Vikings he travels with do some robbing and killing but in a measured way . As the novel goes on a sense of social responsibility manifested in Orm by his adoption of a somewhat twisted form of Christianity comes through.You might say the story of Orm is the story of the Christianizing of Scandinavia told from a rather neutral viewpoint that respects Christianity 's mellowing influence without being blind to its flaws in practice . You might also call it a straightup adventure yarn of many threads . After a battle Orm and his comrades may retire to a feasting hall to hear stories of brave deeds that fill pages and then never come up again . Or else we might get stories like that of a pair of jesters forced to entertain the slayer of the king they loved who come up with a marvelous form of vengeance right out of Monty Python.One thing you ca n't call The Long Ships is dull . Even when Orm is not actually at sea he actually spends a good deal of time raising a family on a farm the book stays busy . Some old enemy is trying to take his head off or else he is having another marvelously circuitous exchange with his dyspeptic priest friend Father Willibald.And the voyages Orm takes are a lot of fun encompassing as they do the whole of the known world at that time from Ireland to the Dnieper River and many points inbetween . While a work of fiction Bengtsson finds ways of introducing a lot of relevant Dark Ages history even if some of it like an enjoyably arch Y1K scare may not be 100 % accurate.Other books are fun to read . The Long Ships is a book to get lost in . You will feel like a teenager again as you take the long way home with Orm enjoying his simpler yet wondrous time and wishing the world could have stayed so forever . ",4
"Very well done . Definitely shows where Robert Low 's inspiration for the Oathsworn series appears to have come from from title character on through the story . The dry understated humor is excellent as advertised . NOTE this is not a rock 'em sock 'em Viking action story but much more of an updated Saga . The cultural insights are superb and it is overall a very enjoyable read once you get into the rhythm of the writing . ",3
"The Long Ships deserves all of the reviewer praise that it has received on this site . When a title receives unanimous fives from more than 70 readers you know it 's something pretty special . It has also inspired a large number of wellwritten reviews over the years leaving me with little more to say than even at more than 500 pages it 's a story that you do n't want to end . The writing is straight forward witty and engrossing from the first page and it makes you want to read it again and again . Wellresearched history and great entertainment . Highly recommended . ",4

My book group picked it because we are all always looking for something different and this was a homerun . I thought it started a bit slowly but it soon picked up and I quickly fell in love with the sweet Red Orm . Yes this pillaging murdering Viking is lovable . The voice was distinct and authentic whatever authentic can mean to a 21st century citizen . There were so many entertaining characters that I laughed aloud throughout . I love good historical fiction from nearly every period and every culture so it 's always nice to discover something different that is written this well . ",4
"I first read this book many years ago . It was good then it 's still good . Timeless . Viking Age fiction is a favorite of mine and this is one of the best I 've read . The movie that was made from it starred Richard Widmark Russ Tamblyn and Sidney Poitier if memory serves and I think it does although the spelling of some of those actors ' names might be slightly off . The movie was entertaining but as is so often true of movies made from sprawling novels like THE LONG SHIPS the book is better ! ",4
"War and strife make for good reading at least for men pining for the fantasy of days of yore where heroestobe would gather fellow men to pillage far away lands for adventure and booty . This is among the best of such works I have read ranking up there with the Homeric tales and the story of the Three Kingdoms from China . These Skanians whom at that time considered themselves Danes a far throw from the pacifist Europeans of modern Denmark are savage men from a harsh culture but they are also full of humor and a sort of stoic approach to both fortune and misfortune that despite their being seamen would make a Spartan from Laconia proud . The story progresses through multiple kingdoms and conveys an accurate historical depiction of cultures at the cusp of the second millenium . Religion is dealt with in a tellingly humorous manner and it reminds one that conversions were historically based on pragmatic choices and rarely some sort of spiritual epiphany . Adherents would switch from one religion to the next as their conditions and fortunes demanded . Buried into this amazingly rich and incredibly fun ! tale of adventure like a vein of gold it is a suitable reminder of what makes us human in this day of flaring religious strife and shameless demagoguery .

"As many others have said this is an epic book that is wonderful and enjoyable to read . I had a hard time with all the Viking names but eventually you get used to that aspect . The author is an excellent story teller . Even though it covers many years many characters and many adventures it is told in such a way that you are able to take it all in at the right pace . Sometimes it was slow and sometimes quick paced . Sometimes the battle scenes are recounted and other times they are skipped over . No one aspect is examined to an extreme degree.I enjoyed reading a novel that took place so long ago and painted a much different life in which we lead today . When men were men and it seems the Vikings were some of the most manly of all . They were violent but had honor reason and their own sense of right and wrong . Just as we do today.I really did not want this book to end and it lives in my mind as if it was real . ",4
"This AMAZING book written in the 1940s translated into English in the 50 's available in English for only a year then gone and now resurfaced mostly thanks to Kindle is one of the most entertaining fun interesting and subtly funny books I 've readever . It follows the life of Orm a Viking who does all the usual Viking stuff pillaging exploring fighting searching for gold etc . etc . I 'm not particularly interested in Viking history and lore but this novel was simply gripping.The Long Ships is a book that operates on multiple levels . For one thing it 's quite an interesting historical novel with fictional main characters who interact with numerous real historical personages providing an excellent feel for the time period the key players and Viking culture . I now know about a thousand times more about who the Vikings were and how they lived and thought than I did before reading the book . On another level it 's fantastic storytelling in fact it 's some of the best storytelling I 've ever read . You get lost in page after page of richly told stories of human conflict honor greed lust friendship revenge and redemption . On another and important level it is a humorous tale with wry and witty observations about the human condition timeless observations about human nature that transcend the place and time of the novel . Finally on another level it 's a poetic saga with beautifullywritten lyrical passages that get you flipping back a page or two to reread what you just read so as to resavor the moment . It is hard to believe that all of this could be accomplished in a single book but there it is.The Vikings led lives of murder pillage rape and mayhem and it 's all here in the book . Yet they also had morality an understanding of right and wrong a way of doing things that made sense to them and was grounded in spirituality that is completely foreign to the modern mind but which sort of makes sense on its own alien terms . A great strength of this book is its ability to place you inside the mindset of Viking morality so you can comprehend how it made sense to them even if it seems and was horrific from a modern perspective . As another reviewer noted the book deals a lot with the Christianization of Scandinavia circa 1000 AD including the massive resistance of the Vikings to missionaries and the pressure to convert to Christianity . This is dealt with in a very evenhanded and balanced perspective I doubt anyone could tell whether the author is particularly pro or antiChristian . The zeal and tenacity of Christian missionaries to convert the heathens is presented both as pushy naive not purely altruistic and destructive but also as peaceseeking beneficial and redemptive . All sides of the issue the societal and spiritual benefits of pacification but also the cultural cost of losing a familiar way of life as an alien moral order gradually takes hold are explored in a thoughtprovoking balanced way.Most of all the characters are surprisingly human . For a people who did n't even flinch at and indeed actively sought out extreme violence people who would hope for a fight to the death at a wedding just to keep things lively people whose lives were nasty brutish and short as a result of their continual warfare and treachery the Vikings are presented as intelligent poetic thoughtful people people who if transported into today 's world would be very recognizable to the modern reader folks with hopes dreams and humanity . It is very hard to reconcile the violence and mayhem of Viking culture with the humanity and likability of the characters but somehow improbably it all fits together . That is what makes this book so absolutely interesting and fun.The author has a wry sense of humor that comes through the pages over and over . The subtle humor adds tremendously to the reading experience.Solid flawless 5star book on every level . ",4
"I think the best way to approach this book is not to think of it as a modern novel but instead imagine that you are being told this story by a grandfather or a bard in an inn on a stormy night.The Long Ships falls somewhere between epic poetry an oral story and a history of the Vikings the book is not however a study of complex characters with deep psychologies and nuance . What you 'll find here is a riproaring yarn about the various heroic adventures of Red Orm and his friends as they travel into Muslim lands and even as far away as modernday Russia and they 'll fight and kill and marry and get religion and behave much more like regular people than what preconceptions about Vikings tend to describe.The only real complaint I have about many of these adventures and the book in general is that too often there is very little sense of danger for Orm I never felt like anything really bad was going to happen to him and so even though the book is very well written it moves at a great clip there is no real tension moving the action forward . Basically we know Orm is going to be alright and so we just need to sit back and enjoy learning how he became alright . And that 's not really a bad thing but even Homer was able to place Odysseus is much tighter spots whose outcomes did n't always feel inevitable.Bengtsson 's strength in the book is portraying the Vikings as real living breathing people and not just bloodthirsty killers bent on raping everything they see . Orm is a generous king one who even converts to the strange and foreign even undesirable religion of Christianity . He treats his friends well is fair to everyone fair to him and is basically the ideal of a great warrior king sort of like a Camelot but with more beards . I got the impression that Bengtsson wanted to celebrate his people 's heritage by lending his characters all the good qualities other writers and historians have managed to overlook when dealing with these people . Of course this means the pendulum swings hard the other way and so this book can only be taken as entertainment with a heavy dose of ancestral pride.Yet it would be unfair for me to require Bengtsson to do anything more than what he has . He has written a story that is above all else fun to read and hard to put down . I mean we 're talking Vikings here and that 's a subject nearly impossible to screw up . Is it uneven ? Sure but so what ? I had fun with it.I would like to add that I find it really strange that this book is not more well known . This book deserves a much wider readership outside of its native country . Thankfully the New York Review of Books have created a wonderful edition and they always do too and hopefully more people will discover this hidden treasure . ",3
"An excellent action packed fast paced look at the Norsemen of the eleventh century . Excellent characters and good story really make this world come alive . The book is surprisingly funny as our hero adopts and discards Islam to later become a rather unorthodox Christian . This time period was fairly unique as several different cultures clashed all over Europe as the Moors of Spain Byzantium The Kievan Rus the Britons all waxed and waned with gangs of rowdy Norsemen going aviking seemingly everywhere.This is an interesting and entertaining look at a unique culture in a unique time and is highly recommended .

"I first read this book about 1970 . And reread it again and again . I had not been able to find a copy to replace mine when it wore out . Glad I found it on Amazon.A good book .

"Every serious reader has had the experience perhaps by accident on a library shelf or in a dusty box at a garage sale you stumble across an outofprint book that seizes your imagination through its author 's sheer mastery of the storytelling craft.And you wonder why O why does n't the publisher reissue this in lieu of one or another of the emminently forgettable titles in current release ? Such a book is THE LONG SHIPS by Frans Bengtssen which crossed the Atlantic from Scandinavia to America in the early 1950s like Leif Ericson who made the same trip long before Columbus this book lingered only briefly here before vanishing with scarcely a trace.And that is a tragedy for anyone who craves an epic lusty tale of Vikings and their travels told with a sophisticated humor that is both wry and understated and with a sense of historical perspective that blends so subtly into the narrative that one is staggered to later find it is painstakingly accurate . Thank you History Channel but I heard it all first and far more compellingly from following Orm Tostesson 's exciting voyages enthusiastic plunderings and thrilling adventures in THE LONG SHIPS.This book is a delight in every way certainly you can read simply for it for the lyrical use of language it is by the way a translation from its original Swedish and translator Michael Meyer deserves canonization for his masterful rendering of it into English . But it works well on so many other levels as an actionadventure or as a characterdriven historical novel that to attempt to limit this book 's sophisticated multilayered appeal would be a disservice.The copy I obtained with great difficulty it 's hard to track down THE LONG SHIPS but well worth the effort when you do was published by Collins of St. James ' Place London . I understand Random House holds the American rights.If there is any justice in the literary world or wisdom left in today 's publishing houses that is not measured with a cash register THE LONG SHIPS would immediately be reissued to a new generation of readers to much fanfare from those of us who have already had the pleasure of reading it.Earl MerkelAuthor FLU SEASONTHE FINAL EPIDEMIC and LIKE DISTANT CITIES BURNING NALPenguinPutnam both scheduled for publication in SummerFall 2002 .

"I know this sounds picky but I would have enjoyed about half of The Long Ships . What I truly did enjoy however was the writing style and the language . Every sentence sounds like it came from one of the Islandic Sagas . This gave a feeling of the Viking Age that was enjoyable . Orm 's adventures never seen to end though he tries to settle down to farming . Is this still part of the Nordic character . I hope so . ",3
"Two Finnish Swedes gave me this book as a house present long ago . They said it was well known and loved in Swedish . I had always liked Viking sagas and Norse mythology but the book 's cover makes it look like an airport novel so I opened and glanced at it without high hopes . It took me by surprise it was so good.I soon climbed into the long ships to go marauding with Orm and his friends and never looked back . Twenty years later I often find myself still thinking about those Vikings and their adventures in Spain in Bulgaria back home with their girls who do n't respect wimps.My husband who thought he was not the least interested in Vikings was also enthralled . The translation is great and it reads like an English novel.Someone borrowed my book so I am hoping it will be republished as a hardback . It well deserves it . ",4
"awesome historical adventure.surprising element is the detail of the christianization of the norsemen which i personally did n't have a problem with i just was n't expecting it from the other reviews i read.this may be a selling point for some if you happen to be into christianity . it should not detract for others if you are interested in historyancestry.if you think this is going to be just ravishing pillaging plundering and adventure you 're going to find it a bit meatier than that.the vikings could be a very solemn reflective people as well as some of the fiercest most effective successful warriors ever.anyone ever write a book about a viking in the court of one of the kahns i 'd like to read it .

"There were some things to like about this book.It transported me to another time another way of life . I 'm not sure how accurate a portrayal of the times this book managed but I 'm pretty sure there was much about it that caught the flavor of the time . Fighting hard and thieving adventures with ominous dangers all served to remind we were n't always washing our hands with antibacterial soap and recording three television shows while watching a fourth . Mankind has a colorful past and this is a part of it I had n't spent a lot of time thinking about but I enjoyed my immersion into the Viking world with all those men and all those kings.The humor was sometimes subtle sometimes not but definitely there and woven effortlessly throughout . I found myself giggling and snickering and snorting on occasion and smiling through much of this book.I like a good action movie and I like adventure stories and there was definitely some good adventure in this book.But to me this book had some big problems.It was episodic . Not a bad thing per se if you 're picking it up over a number of weeks months and reading it like a serial . But I was reading this as a book group selection and had to keep trudging through it even when I would normally have put it down . It just did n't hang together for me as a novel more as a series of short stories.The characters were simple not too deep and they fit with the stories but it was hard for me to care too much about any of them . I have trouble when I ca n't invest in at least one of the characters.Finally and most importantly it was too long . I have two or three other books on my shelf and about a third of the way through this one I kept wishing I could put it down and read something else something that would excite and interest me more deeply.For these reasons I can only give this book three stars and would only recommend it with caveats .

"I have recently gotten in the middle of a Viking phase started by the admirable works of Tim Severin . When I came across The Long Ships I thought why not give it a try having heard nothing about the story or history.In short this book is very good . It is entertaining and the characters particularly Orm and Ylva are enjoyable realistic and personable.It is also very clear to me at least that Mr Severin had to use this as his inspiration for his own Viking trilogy . And like many other imitiations Mr Severin 's work does not own up to The Long Ships.Buy this book and be prepared for a few hours of enjoyment ! ! ! ",4

"Let 's get this out first . The cover to this book is just plain awful . Normally I would pass this book by figuring if the publisher did n't care enough about it to pay for a decent artist how good could it be ? Thankfully some of the reviews here encouraged me to take a chance and I definately did n't regret it.I do n't know if it 's due to the translation or the author 's style but the writing is absolutely superb in conveying the feeling of the time . You could just imagine this story being told in exactly the same way hundreds of years ago across a campfire or over a good cup of mead.A great story that takes place in a time and among a people who do n't get many good books written about them . Check this one out ! ",4
"This book is an eternal classic . Set in the height of Viking Age it tells us how Orm Snake is kidnapped by a band of marauding vikings . He then serves as a slave on a moorish ship he is a mercenary among the muslims he is marauder in England . He marries royally settles and goes on a treasure hunt for stolen gold in Russia . Bengtson uses the laconic language of the vikings to hilarious effects . The translator manages to keep it which is great . The book is historically accurate with many historical events and persons interwoven in the narrative . ",4
"The Long Ships is a book for those of us who as boys read Sir Walter Scott and Rudyard Kipling the Rover Boys Series Mark Twain and Moby Dick as an adventure story and also for everyone of us of either sex and of whatever age who can now sit back and enjoy some great stories of Viking adventure threaded through and through with humor and not a little historical accuracy . While it 's a serious book in that I was written by an author of talent an essayist and poet in his own land Sweden and is therefore well written it 's not a serious book to be taken seriously . It has no message and no moral . It does n't try to solve any problems . It just tells some great stories.For the record The Long Ships is a collection of four novellas centered on the life and adventures of Red Orm Tostesson a late Eleventh Century 9801025 Viking who lived in Skania in what was then a part of the kingdom of the Danes but which now lies on the southern tip of Sweden . The stories were first written and published in Swedish by Frans Bengsston a Swedish essayist translator and poet in 194041 and then translated and published in English in 1954 15 years laterAll four of these novellas contain a heady stew of history derringdo adventure love fortune friendship and always violence . In the first story where Red Orm the son of Toste and his wife Asa goes aViking in Krok 's ship with his friend Toke plunders the coasts of Normandy and Northern Spain is captured by the Moors spends six years as a galley slave becomes a member of the Empower Alamansur 's bodyguard steals the world 's most valuable necklace and then the largest bell from the Monastery of St James now Santiago de Campostella in Galicia escapes and returns home safely there is enough material for a year 's season of TV episodes.The same is true of the next three in the first of which he second of the novellas Red Orm is a part of the Viking fleet which defeats the British read AngloSaxons at the battle of Maldon and eventually procured a true King 's ransom from weak King Ethelred.Then in the next story the third novella Red Orm and his family and retainers move to a safer place in the woods above their home in Skania to escape the wrath of King Sven Forkbeard Orm has married Ylva the beautiful youngest daughter of King Harald and sister of King Sven Forkbeard who is furious over the marriage . Here they have an almost endless series of adventures and then finally in the fourth story Red Orm and his now grown sons and retainers together with his old friend Toke take a ship up the River Dvina over The Great Portage to the Dneiper and down the Dneiper past Kiev to The Weirs where they retrieve a great treasure and return safely home to live happily to the end of their days with fortune and family . Best I can figure the route in present day terms is that they entered the Dvina at its mouth in the Gulf of Riga in Latvia went up the Dvina to the source of the Deneiper in Russia and down the Dneiper to what is probably site of the huge Dnipropetrovsky Dam 200 miles up river from the Black Sea . Whatever it was it was quite a journey ! I recommend that the book be read slowly and for pleasure not for knowledge although there 's a lot of history in it . . Take one novella at a time and enjoy it . I think Bengtsson wrote it for pleasure . An accomplished poet himself he larded it with the extemporaneous verses of his characters although as translated from the Swedish the poetry does not come through to the English reader . And he has a sense of humor . In every novella there are episodes which are simply over the top funny like the Flashman stories they have all characteristics of Red Orm as Dick Armstrong the AllAmerican Boy . In fact I think all these novellas are basically for men who are still boys at heart . Do n't take this book too seriously.You will however if you read it come away with some real feeling for history in Red Orm 's time . You will realize that there was no glamour in the Viking life . The Vikings were basically plunderers setting out each spring in individual ships or groups of one or two to go aViking along the coast of the North Atlantic countries . They were violent men . Swordplay and battle was the rule rather than the exception and the pages of this book run red with the blood spilled by the characters in these stories . If you believe what Bengtsson writes they actually sought warfare and violence rather than peace.Furthermore if you read it you will have a feel for the work of the several religious orders that sent Priests to the Vikings in an effort to Christianize them and the effect on Red Orm of his baptism in Book Three . You will have a feel for the limited extent to which civilization as the Western World then knew it had changed the way of life of the many small tribes which inhabited the region of the Danes and how far they had to come to catch up.I enjoyed it and hope you do too .

"This is good writing done with dry wit . Not only do we see the lifestyle of the northmen but we get a good dose of history and the surprising extent of Viking influence . ",4
"The book was long as it traced the life of a Danish Viking from youth to maturity . It consisted of one adventure after another based on the concept of aviking across England Ireland and Europe . Clearly the main character traveled far and wide including time in the Spain of the Moors . If you are not a patient reader you could become a little bored with the ongoing story but it was overall an entertaining story . ",3
"Of all the historical novels I 've read the ones that stand out for me are Quo Vadis I Claudius and Frans Bengtsson 's The Long Ships . Though not as well known as the other two this saga of Viking adventurers resembles them in recreating a convincing and authentic historical period peopled by characters whom we can relate to even though they are not as in so many historical novels merely disguised moderns . I 'd recommend it to anyone who wants a great entertaining read that 's also educational . I have n't seen the 1963 film of this book but I 've heard it 's not nearly as good . So if you 've seen the film and were disappointed give the book a try anyway . ",4
"A brilliantly written tale it smacks of the Nordic sagas in style but never heavy . Many here have given it five stars I have not only because I reserve five for the fabulously great that I do n't think any educated person should fail to read . This might not quite gain those heights but it nevertheless was a fabulous read . ",3
"If you liked Michael Chabon 's Gentlemen of the Road you will love this which I believe was the inspiration for that first book . Published in 1954 it is by turns epic saga straight forward historical engaging and sly and generally a satisfying old yarn about the Vikings in Scandinavia in the 10th century . Adventures on the high seas romance and kidnapping abound . Released as a New York Review Books Classic . Enjoy . ",3
"From my perspective the mark of a really good book is fear that it will soon end . That was my feeling when reading The Long Ships . While I long for a successor work there will be none from the nowdeceased Frans G. Bengtsson whose outstanding tale of the Vikings with its epic hero in epic adventures is quite simply one of the best examples in the longstanding tradition one which extends from Homer 's Iliad and Odyssey through Beowulf and The Nibelungenlied to mention only a very few of the very finest . Red Orm is now resting in Valhalla just as Odysseus lies in the Elysian fields and Siegfried 's strength had ebbed away for in the field of his bright countenance he now displayed Death 's token . Soon many fair ladies would be weeping for him.Bengtsson 's hero goes aViking initially as a captive of the marauding Krok on his long ship and later on his own adventures . He sails as an oarslave for the Moors roves ashore in the guard of the Moorish potentate Almansur in Cordoba returns homeward in a captured ship returns home where he establishes himself as a soberminded chieftain humorously and pragmatically engages with and accepts Christianity quests for Bulgarian treasure battles with sword and club and finds domestic contentment at voyages ' end.The writing style is heroic but not overwrought . Here is an example with Orm talking to his companion Toke I know what I am leaving behind but the wisest of men could not tell me to what I am returning or whether things will turn out as I fear they may . Another example But sometimes he was visited by evil dreams and then he would become so agitated in his sleep that Ylva would wake him to ask whether the night mare was riding him or whether there was any trouble on his mind . When he had awakened and had fortified his courage with strong ale she would hear perhaps that in his sleep he had returned to the Moorish galley and had been rowing his heart out as the whip snaked across his shoulders and the groans of his fellows filed his ears and their wealed backs bent painfully before his eyes and on the morning after such a dream he loved to sit beside Rapp who never dreamed in the carpenter 's shed and exchanged memories with him of those faroff days . What could be more perfectly evocative ? The playful and pragmatic engagement of the heathen Vikings with their gods and the Christian god was also brilliantly rendered . For example Orm remarks Whether any of our gods have done anything for me though I do not know certain it is that I have not done much for them.If there are any authors who are currently writing with the verve and epic sweep of The Long Ships I am unaware of them . If there are any other modern adventure tales that can stand equal with The Long Ships I know nothing of them either . This is I say without hesitation an immortal masterpiece . NYRB deserves immense credit for resurrecting it . If you are searching for another book that embodies the same virtues I unhesitatingly recommend if you can find it the wonderful textual rendering of ancient poem The Nibelungenlied by A.T. Hutto found in an early 1965 Penguin edition . ",4
"THE LONG SHIPS is oldschool narrative with a very traditional feel as Frans G. Bengtsson weaves historical fiction from a Viking pointofview . There 's a sweep to it yes as it follows the life of Orm Tostesson from his youth to older age . Episodic it is also interrupted in the classical way as brief stories are told by new characters who happen into the narrative.To start Orm goes to Muslim Spain where he is captured by the Moors and forced to convert . He becomes the bodyguard of a wealthy Muslim caliph . After a series of adventures there the action shifts north to Ireland and then England under the inept King Ethelred . Yes you will learn some history reading this book as Bengtsson allows Red Orm to interact with real characters throughout . Part Three of the book takes us to Orm 's homeland and concerns marriage conversion to Christianity and children . Of course to keep readers interested violence remains a way of life even here . And in the final section Orm seeks a treasure in the lands past Kiev . This part was too brief and seemed to have more possibility to it.Nevertheless there 's no denying the bond that will form between reader and Orm . Although it might be called a man 's book it holds strong female characters too especially Orm 's wife Ylva daughter of Harald BlueTooth . And through it all is a sense of humor . Can you do worse than that between all the looting and bloodletting ? I thought not . If you 're looking for a book of the sort you read as a kid the kind you just ate up due to its story this is a distinct possibility . Adventure and history make wonderful bedfellows and nothing proves it as much as THE LONG SHIPS . ",3
"A most entertaining story about the adventures of Orm the Viking ! My interest was held throughout the whole book . I recommend it ! ",4
"LOVE historical novels . This one really gave me lots of information about my ancestral roots and explains alot about the different experiences of the Vikings . The hero of the piece returned to MalmoSkane the area from which my Swedish ancestors come . The journeys through the known world also gave me insight into why my Norwegian great grandfather had dark hair dark eyes and a last name which it is said has a meaning regarding the land in Italian.One of my grandfathers Swede side is named Fred Oscar Bengtson .

"I am enjoying this book very much as it gives a good view of the movements of Vikings and the coming of Christianity and how it started to be applied . Also the ways of Odin and the long boats that went to far thru seas . What violent people they were in their plundering . especially since that blood runs thru our family ! The near generations we come from are so far from that kind of people . ",4
"I had a copy of this book thirty years ago and loaned it to someone . Never got it back . After I read it again I was as pleased as I was back then . Adventure gold comrades in arms if you like this in a Viking setting you should enjoy this book . ",4
"Written with humour and accuracy this tale or saga sets the standard for Viking era fiction . The characters are written with sympathy and are entirely believable the action moves along at a brisk pace and altogether this is an excellent book.Do n't be tempted to watch the Hollywood film of the same name after the book it 's laughable .

"'The Long Ships ' has been on my short list of 'best books ever written ' for years . It is a riproaring adventure tale a great introduction to historical fiction and one of the funnier books that I have read . Any time that you spend on it will be time not 'spent ' but 'invested ' . I 'm excited that it has been reprinted I 'll be able to retire my 50 year old yellowpaged mass market paper copy before the spine splits into a third part . I genuinely envy everyone who has not yet read this book and picks it up . You 're in for a real treat ! ",4

"Would you be surprised to read a Vikingage Epic and find it to be warm inspiring and relentlessly violent but in a good way ! ? Would you be delighted to read a good yarn that included people referred to as Berserks ? Just have fun with this one . Wellwritten accessible but describing a time that was critical to the creation of the Western World and yet never quite covered in normal history classes . ",4
"I 've read this novel many years ago and left within me a certain fascination for the Viking Era.Lastly books like Harry Harrison 's The Hammer & the Cross trilogy movies like Grendel & Beowulf 2005 and Beowulf 2007 had triggered again my curiosity about these times . So I decided to pay a visit aka reread The Long Ships.And here I am reviewing this excellent book authored by Sweden writer Frans G. Bengtsson 18941954 . The book was originally published in two parts first in 1941 and second in 1945 the present edition contains both of them.The story follows the life & circumstances of Orm from infancy to old age at the same time describing daily life of that period.Orm as teenager is abducted by a Viking warparty and joins them willingly after a short period . From their homeland they sail to Spain where they are captured by Moors and enter Almansur 's service.After serving some years as Caliph 's bodyguards they are forced to fly and return home yet not emptyhanded.They are welcome at Denmark King Harald 's Bluetooth court where Orm fall in love with Ylva one of the King daughters and ask her hand . The King is quite accessible but asks Orm to ensure his wealth and return next year.Orm & his friends join a mighty Viking army and sail to invade King Ethelred 's the Unprepared England . After many battles and errands Orm rejoin exiled Ylva & marry her returning then to his home.Orm and his family are forced into exile to escape King Sven Forkbeard revengeful mood and finally root in his mother 's ancestral domains.After years of consolidating his position as a respected member of that frontier community Orm sail for his last great adventure in Eastern lands.This is a very entertaining book merging seamlessly historical characters as King Harald Sven Ethelred and Caliph Almansur with fictional ones as Orm Ylva Asa and Toste . The author is able to transmit to the reader the true spirit of those turbulent times . Another very interesting aspect of the story is showing the beginning of Christianization of Scandinavian communities.Take a joyful romp thru Viking 's world you wo n't be disappointed !

"This had been recommended to me several times particularly by others who read and enjoyed Bernard Cornwell 's Saxon Tales which take place at exactly the time as The Long Ships and actually include some of the historical characters.I tried to ration this novel out savoring every chapter watching with dread as the number of pages to the end dwindled Alas I could n't make it last forever it 's one of those books that left me a bit sad at the end for I 'll never again have the thrill of reading it for the first time.It 's a story about Vikings one Viking in particular who gallivants around 10th century Europe doing all of those things that the Vikings were famous for doing . Orm Tosteson 's world is a surprisingly cosmopolitan one he travels from his home in Sweden to the Mediterranean befriending a Jewish merchant and entering the service of the Muslim Caliph of Andalusia returns home with stops in France and the British Isles and ventures later in his life up and down rivers in Central Europe as far as the Black Sea . His travels and associates allow him to experience and weigh the relative merits of several different religious traditions these Vikings really got around.Michael Chabon 's effusive introduction to the edition I read was spoton yes it 's basically a Viking adventure story but offers something for everyone . Although initially skeptical of the praise heaped upon the book I now find myself agreeing with Chabon that the novel stands ready given the chance to bring lasting pleasure to every single human being on the face of the earth.It 's beautifully written or at least beautifully translated from the Swedish imparting a love of language and a loyalty to the ancient epics.I was totally unprepared for and very pleasantly surprised by how funny certain parts of the book were . The first few pages deal with the fate of Christian missionaries in the lands of the Northmen and are absolutely hysterical . Bengtsson 's sardonic humor blends perfectly with the brutality of the age he 's writing about.In short I ca n't recommend this book highly enough . If you enjoy reading fiction at all you 'll enjoy it . Again I 'll steal from Chabon 's introduction I loved it immoderately . ",4
"If you like historical fiction this is a must read . You will come to love Red Orm and his adventures . But you will also learn a lot of history about Denmark England Norway Sweden etc . I kept repeatedly referring to Wikipedia to read more about the kings and others that Orm kept meeting up with . I also found out that our modern day bluetooth was named after King Harald Bluetooth ! I highly recommend this book to any fan of historical fiction . ",4
"This book covers an amazing period of history that is basically neglected . It was fantastic and very well written although it was a translation from the original . This would appeal to men and women alike as well as teens that are history buffs.Ca n't say enough about the saga as Norse stories are called ",4
"I have a Norse heritage and loved every minute of this it must have hit my DNA just right ! If you like real adventure believable and historic you will like this one . ",4
"This novel originally published in the 1940 's as two books tells the story of Orm Tostesson a Dane who did what many Scandinavian men did in the 10th century he went aViking . Orm 's voyages take him to Andalusia Spain Britain and Russia . He makes friends and enemies has wins and losses and while I 've never been a fan of pillaging I had to admire him.Bengtsson 's writing style might seem odd even staid to modern readers . There are no literary embellishments Bengtsson simply tells Orm 's story explicitly . It 's all on the page . There will be passages that make the reader pause and ponder not to decipher meaning but to consider the differences between present day and the 10th century.Religion Christianity and Islam has a large role in the book . In one of my favorite passages a character wonders why a king has converted to Christianity . He determines that kings drink stronger ale than other man and have many women and that can tire a man over the years so that his understanding darkens and he no longer knows what he is doing.I was n't bored for a minute . The book is loaded with everything that makes a good adventure story and even when Orm is living quietly at home there 's plenty going on . I totally agree with Chabon who says in the introduction that this book stands ready . . . to bring lasting pleasure to every single human being on the face of the earth . ",4
"A number of years ago I stumbled upon a nonfiction history of the Norman invasion of England in 1066 and immediately decided that I wanted to read everything I could about this historical period especially works of fiction which I love . Well there was Mirsky 's King of Vinland Saga which was good but needed more depth there was King Hereafter by Dorothy Dunnett which was as usual for her too dense there was the outofprint Golden Warrior by Hope Muntz which was excellent but perhaps required a bit too much work . I finally read several hundred pages worth of the Sagas of the Icelanders but as interesting as these were they bear little resemblance to the modern novel . Recently I came upon the Long Ships and here finally it is . This great book ranks up there with the best historical fiction of any genre and is certainly the best I have come across as it regards the ancient Vikings.First it is pageturning exciting adventure . Little battles big battles individual confrontations blood feuds revenge camaraderie treasure despair hate and love it 's all here . The book pretty much follows the career as it were of Orm who is initially kidnapped by the crew of a Viking ship and who agrees to accompany them on their ambitious faraway raid to a wealthy fortress on the Iberian peninsula . Orm did n't particularly mind being kidnapped too much as raiding for plunder was pretty much the goal of every Northman over the age of about twelve anyway . Interestingly the word Viking here is used as a verb . To go on a raiding party is to go aviking.Their raid is a success to begin with but they are in turn are attacked by a fleet of Moorish vessels out for revenge . Those that survive are captured and become galley slaves for almost three years . Through luck and circumstance they are freed and made bodyguards to the powerful Almansur the Muslim lord . Eventually they escape and make their way back to their homes in the North but not before fighting several other battles and experiencing many other adventures . We 're only about half way through at this point and there is much much more to come.Along with Orm 's adventures the novel is interspersed with the stories of just about everybody they run into . The Vikings loved stories and poems and there are many different tales told by many different personalities many of which are of some length and all of which are bloody and riveting.So there is adventure aplenty here but the novel is also very wellwritten filled with wit irony and humor . Orm is grievously wounded after a bloody battle to the death and is tended to by King Harald 's daughter . The Vikings had a pretty sophisticated system of justice but alas when all else fails it 's a kill or be killed . In any event she tells Orm that she was betrothed to the person that he killed . Orm is naturally worried that she will seek her revenge on him . She tells him that she hated the man that Orm killed and would have murdered him in his sleep . Eventually Orm begins to take to her and starts to woo her You told me that if you had been forced to marry Sigtrygg you would have driven a knife into him in his bridal bed he says to her after suggesting that he wanted to marry her and I should like to be sure that you feel differently towards me . She laughs merrily . The book is filled with clever wordplay such as this on just about every page and you will find a smile coming to your face often.Some reviews here have expressed doubt that these illiterate Vikings would be so articulate but I 'm not so sure . No they were not educated to any extent but it must be remembered that there were few forms of entertainment in those days other than storytelling and wordofmouth so it is quite likely that to entertain or to be entertained one may very well have had to cultivate linguistic skills.Lastly the novel is rich in historical detail especially that having to do with the mindset of those that lived back then . The Vikings were somewhat religious but not terribly so and were far more interested in doing whatever it was that would bring them luck . Indeed they become Muslims while in Spain at the insistence of their Muslim superiors . Our Gods do n't seem to be too powerful here one remarks . Eventually Orm is persuaded to become a Christian not because of a new found love for Jesus but primarily due to convenience . There is a great deal of discussion of Christianity in the novel the way it was practiced and the pragmatic unconventional ways by which the priests tried to gain converts . It is quite interesting and has the ring of truth to it.There is also the Viking way of life their customs and their culture . Farming mostly some trading . They loved women and they loved boozing . As much as anything though it was raiding and fighting and maintaining one 's honor . A brutal way of life to be sure but that was the way in northern Europe . And there are many descriptions of foreign climes as well northern Europe to be sure but also England Ireland Spain central Europe and Russia . It is simply fascinating.Great novel . Ranks up there with the best historical fiction . ",4
"OkayI love historical fiction a lot . This book gave a blink into the Viking Era . But the characters were very flat almost boring especially the protagonists and antagonists . I kept asking for more and more but it never showed up . I liked the descriptions of daily life of the Vikings and even their contact with other cultures but this book had so much more potential.Honestly a little more about battle and fighting would have been nice but the author was trying to hard to romanticize the Vikings as opposed to depicting them for what they really were . Violent and raging fighters . At one point I just wanted it to be over . ",2
"This is a fantastic action packed picaresque enough adjectives ? Norse saga . Our hero Orm and his band of merry bad asses go a Viking and get into all kinds of interesting and thouroughly enjoyabe scrapes en route . The plot has a nice way of seeding characters and events that reappear later in the story . The book is plot driven but the main character is nicely drawn and the tone is deadpan humor no matter the event.It was written in 1956 so I was afraid it would be dated but no its fresh and crisp totally au fait with our zeitgeist . Having read far too many of Bernard Cornwell 's Saxon saga 's this was truly refreshing . Unlike the recent crop of Cornwellia the author knows exactly where he 's going and does n't tarry taking you there . The translation is excellent I guess my old Norse is a trifle rusty it certainly scans well.Highly reccomended.For those of you who like this genre you might want to check out Eagle In the Snow by Wallace Breem . Another forgotten classic it tells the story of Maximus who guards the Rhine against people like Orm . He is woefully outnumbered by the Northmen and the struggle is epic . A great read albeit a shade or two darker than Long Ships . ",4
"A well documented adventure novel which has not become dated . I read for the first time 20 years ago and this time I enjoyed even more . Excellent ambience which shows the author 's great knowledgfe of the period . ",3
"All the reviewers are correct . I was a bit skptical at first . One of the greatest tales ever told . If you like 'Vikings ' on the History Channel YOU 'LL LOVE THIS ! Adventure love betrayal gold ! Even the most jaded reader will find this enjoyable . A real page turner that 'll keep yo up at nightEnjoy~ ! ",4
"The first half of the moving moved along smartly but then the story bogged down and after slogging slowly through about 3050 more pages I threw in the towel . ",2
"Quiet simply this is one of the great adventure stories . It deserves to be read by everyone who loves wonderful characters exotic settings fast action and clever dialogue.Like Michael Chabon who writes the introduction I first read this book as a 13 year old . I remember sneaking the book into church and hiding it in textbooks on top of my desk . I do n't remember where I got the copy I read . I always remembered the story but the title was lost in my memory banks . Despite searching many bookstores through the years I was never able to find it again.It was a great pleasure to rediscover the book on Amazon . In the last few weeks I 've sent Kindle copies to my wife my grown children and many friends . I 've also bought a couple of hard copies just to make sure I do n't loose track of it again.It you only have time to read one book this year I strongly suggest you choose this one . ",4
"A quick read of historical fiction . A look at the life of the vikings that not all blood and guts . ",3
"The Long Ships is a true classic novel as much as that term is overused . This splendid novel combines deadly adventure humor and an insightful look at the Viking age and society into a story that is a true pageturner . This is the story of Orm a Danish Viking of noble blood who leads a life that is more fruitful and adventurous than most . Orm begins life as an overprotected younger son who is abducted by Vikings and who then speaks up for himself and eventually becomes a Viking chieftain by virtue of his intelligence leadership and strength . This novel really gets inside of Scandinavian society at the height of the Viking Age and truly acquaints the reader with the way people thought about life and things in those days . There are more wonderful anecdotes in this novel than I can count or remember . This novel is a rare reading pleasure.The Viking Age was a terrible age of rich living and hard dying . The Vikings themselves were a scourge against the peoples of Europe and beyond and yet as this novel shows they were people too with all the motivations that people have always had in every age . This novel truly brings this age to life and the reader will come to greatly care about Orm and his wife Ylva who is the daughter of a King . This story is not all about war and battle . The substory about the Christian Magister and his love of women is one of the funniest things I have ever read . It is a rare novel that can combine adventure and humor the way this one does.Incidentally while this novel was the inspiration for the Richard WidmarkSidney Portier movie The Long Ships the storyline itself has about nothing in common with that fun movie . At most some of the names are the same.I could go on and on about what a fine story this novel is but I am sure that by now you get the idea . This one is an outstanding reading experience and is not to be missed . Highly recommended . RJB . ",4
"Amazon needs to create a sixstar rating just for this book . It encompasses the whole sweep of life and it is filled with humor . ",4
"This book was vivid in its descriptions of life on the sea in the days of the Vikings . The adventures seemed really taken from the lives of people in that era . ",4
"This was a good book . I was not able to zip through it rather I put it down read other books and came back to it again and again until it was finished . It was absorbing . I got a feel for the time and how these people thought and interacted with one another and also other people.I would recommend this book to others . ",3
"A book like they do n't write any more more 's the pity . An absolute hoot of an adventure . I 'm sorry I did n't discover it years ago . ",3
"I bought this moreorless on spec on the strength of a couple of sentences of recommendation from Michael Chabon for which many thanks Michael . The funny thing is that now that I have it it is immediately obvious that while Chabon covers a fair bit of ground in his intro . one thing that he does n't know is that Red Orm is alive and well and familar to any six year old german boy e.g . my two sons in Vickie und die st & aumlrken M & aumlnner `` ' '' ' '' ' '' ' an old japansegerman animated TV series that tells the adventures of the clever redhaired Viking boy Vikkie his girlfriend Ylvi his mother is Ylva and his enemy Der Schreckliche Sven and which has been repeating forever on german TV . It 's pretty obvious as soon as you pick up the book and then you run into Ylvi and the Swedish entry for Vicke Vicking the original book on Wikipedia confirms it . This only makes The Long Ships even more fun to read and is precisely the sort of configuration that MIchael Chabon of all people would appreciate.Adventures ships galley slaves friends and roasted lamb round beach campfires pretty girls fights axes toledo swords more adventures more fights and of course baddies that cry out to be played by Alan Rickman in the movie . In short a very superior ripping yarn for literate small boys of all ages and sexes . You can imagine Orm late in life on his estate settling down to a copy of Beowulf alecup beside him and not being terribly impressed . ",4
"Having heard so much about this sagatype novel I sought it eagerly & finally broke down & bought it via amazon uk after a long & fruitless hunt stateside . Rather expensive for this paperback wlots of typos & editing problems I thought . But the book I judge was worth it in the end . The tale of Orm Tostesson & friends this book follows the adventures of this typical late tenth century viking through nearly all the highpoints of vikingdom in the period . From raids & servitude on the coasts of Moorish Spain to visits with Irish monks and dinner with the Danish King Harald Bluetooth and his assorted guests including no less a worthy than Styrbiorn Olafsson the Jomsviking and claimant to the Swedish throne about whom E. R. Eddison wrote so brilliantly in his own viking novelStyrbiorn the Strong this book takes us through all the paces . Orm ends up with a very noble wife living in a backwater part of Scandinavia the borderlands between Sweden and medieval Denmark but even there he gets no peace since his enemies and adventures pursue him . And in his maturity another and final adventure comes his way when he is summoned to the eastern reaches of far Gaardarike the country that was to become Russia to claim an inheritance of great value . Along the way Orm makes some good friends some bad enemies participates in some but by no means all of the great events of viking history in that period and finally mellows to become a better man who embraces the new way of thinking while yet feeling at home in the old.I did think the book a bit too episodic though this is no indictment of it since the sagas themselves are nearly always such and the voice smacks very much of the sagaman 's art . However a close reading makes this very clearly a modern novel for the humor is quite bracing and alone marks this tale out as one of ours and not one from an earlier time . I especially appreciated Orm 's hypochondria despite his courage in the face of battle a very human and humorous touch ! And the fighting is all very realistic no great superhuman feats of derring do except occasionally as we find in the real sagas . Some of the literary technniques used besides the marvelous sense of tongueincheek humor are also quite contemporary . I did think the tale a bit slow in places especially at the beginning and rather more predictable than not.And more it is not in my opinion the best of the viking or saga novels despite what others have said here . For tautness and action none have yet done it better in my opinion than H. Rider Haggard with Eric Brighteyes . For the pure poetry of style Eddison 's STYRBIORN THE STRONG still has my vote . And for the resounding greatness of the tale and the power to move no modern author has ever penned a better saga novel than Hope Muntz did withThe Golden Warrior . But Bengtsson did a very nice job and deserves five stars for it . I take my hat off to him and to those here whose reviews obliged me to obtain and read this fine viking tale.For those with an interest in the saga as novel a few other good ones I 'd recommend include Cecelia Holland 's very modern and psychologicalTwo Ravens a glimpse into the hothouse environment of an Icelandic farm and Jane Smiley'sThe Greenlanderswhich tells of the final days of the the Norse settlement in Greenland as the cold and the Eskimos closed in around the settlers there . And if you still have any patience and want more perhaps you 'd want to try my own small effort THE KING OF VINLAND 'S SAGA which I wrote to be the saga I 'd always wished had been written and preserved about the Norse excursions to this part of the world . All I believe are available in some form or another online . Mine I know is.Stuart W. MirskyAuthor ofThe King of Vinland 's Saga ",4
"This is a slower moving story of one mans life back aroun 900 to 1000 AD . I found it interesting and easy to follow . By the time I was in about two chapters in I was hooked . I was sorry to see the story end . ",4
"The Long Ships was a perfect addition to what I know about Gotland Sweden . The story is well written and I can feel a closeness to the main characters and their struggle to travel make a success of their long voyages and learn new beliefs and religions . This book is a wonderful action filled saga . I hope readers will share it with a younger generation of reader with Viking heritage.While the story is full of twists and turns some can be anticipated . The text is long.I found it perfect for my purposes of increasing my knowledge of The Viking life . It is amazing and lucky the hero and his family had a happy ending on those violent times . The ending makes the account hopeful and a good choice to share with readers new to sagas . ",4
"Swedish author Frans Bengtson wrote this tale about half a century ago ! These are the adventures of Orm who began his Viking career as an obscure farmer and ended it as a respected and prosperous landholder . In the course of his life Orm participates in great deeds abroad and meets many famous Nordic warriors as they forge the events of history.Orm 's tragic first viking expedition took him on an unprofitable summer of raiding on the coasts of the Baltic Sea and the Atlantic Ocean . In Spain although fighting heroically the Norsemen of his company were overwhelmed and captured by Moors . Here they languished for a few years as galley slaves until they escaped stealing a galley and a massive golden bell in the process.Returning to the Northland Orm and his comradeinarms Toke attend a feast at the hall of King Harald Bluetooth of Denmark . Among the exhalted guests are King Styrbjorn usurped king of Sweden and some survivors of the notorious Jomsvikings . A Jomsviking veteran retells his account of the momentous events after their last battle and Orm fights a duel with a disgruntled guest.Orm goes home to settle in Sweden becoming a landholder but his adventurous days abroad are not yet over ",4
"This book so rousing and delightful bogs down depressingly in the middle half . The Border Lands section is a terrible slog . Otherwise spending time with Orm and his sweaty friends is the most fun I 've with a book in ages . ",3
"Here we have another highlyrated book which I could not finish.As others noted it begins very strong . But it never progresses nor develops into a story which becomes involving . The characters are unidimensional . They generate neither sympathy nor joy and they are stuck in a storytelling style which is framed in the act of recounting a multiyear adventure where the same things keep happening The Vikings go ashore in strange places to pillage . They then hightail it on the sea before they are caught . Sometimes they escape sometimes they are captured and enslaved . Rinse repeat.Drama complications character development Nonexistent . Humor Rare regardless of what the other reviews promise . Nevertheless it 's the nondynamic style which truly kills it.I usually give up on boring books if they do n't become very promising by the 25 % mark . I stuck with this one until I 'd finished 30 % because it was unusual and intermittently interesting at the beginning . But there are too many good books to discover rather than stick with something tediously written delivering diminishing returns.While thick it is a very shallow book which might make a good adventure movie for kids or the extremely undemanding . ",1
"The Long Ships by Frans G. Bengtsson offers a glimpse into the ideals and attitudes of Viking life at end of the 10th century . The Epic takes the readers into the Kingdoms of Spain England and Russia as it follows the adventures of Orm and his fellow adventurers . I particularly liked the attitudes expressed as the new religions were confronted . It illustrated how religions are altered to fit the needs and existing attitudes of the new adherants . I agree with the other reviews and wish the book were republished so more people could enjoy it . ",4
"Bengtsson has done a spectacular job of bringing the days of Viking to life . In the past I 've enjoyed reading translations of many sagas from around the era this describes . There 's nothing like an original source of course even in translation . But for a fictional tale I found this a lively and clever invention . It makes the most of the cultural shifts under way as Christianity made its first uncertain inroads into the north but also takes advantage of the Vikings ' wide travels downward toward Moorish Iberia and inland toward modern Russia . These offer wide scope for adventure swashbuckling humor wild coincidence and a bit of understated warrior philosophy.And throughout Bengtsson throws in asides that had me rolling . For example one recent convert to Christianity had also been under Muslim command in previous years including religious observances . So when he crossed wires and announced There is no god but God and Christ is His prophet it seemed a natural if humorous enough slip not that the priests took it in that spirit.I ca n't comment on the original but I found this translation easy to enjoy . It comes across as natural and reasonably modern but without losing the thousandyearold flavor of they story 's setting and certainly without losing any of the incredible factual research that went underlies the fiction . This book was recommended to my by someone with an uncommon knack for picking books as gifts and proves that she has n't lost her touch . I was sorry to see the last page arrive . wiredweird ",4

"It 's probably no accident Alistair MacLean 's literary career rose to widespread prominence at the same time as commercial air travel . MacLean was the ultimate airplane fiction writer someone whose picaresque globetrotting adventure novels could be devoured in a single sitting.He might be remembered for thin characters and wooden dialogue but it was MacLean 's fastpaced narrative often very alive and tactile that gained him fans . Something else too he had a formula but a lot of creativity within that formula an ability to develop gripping stories by putting his goodguybadguy adventure yarns in unusual settings and situations . In that way he was a lot better than many give him credit for.Unfortunately MacLean 's mobile imagination did n't always produce great fiction which leads us to Caravan To Vaccares . A mysterious fellow named Bowman shadows a group of mysterious murderous Gypsies around the south of France . He jokingly explains his motives to his companion Cecile as being those of a vengeful layabout but what he 's really up to is left opaque.Adding to the chemistry of mood here is a group of mysterious women being held captive by the Gypsies one with weals covering her back a Chinese couple that appear and disappear at several points in the narrative saying nothing but watching everything a charging bull and a French duke of marked appetite and hauteur who may not be as much of a neutral observer as he seems.Le Grand Duc as he is called is the most interesting character in Caravan and MacLean has fun with him . Bursting in on a budding hostage situation he is told he ca n't just barge in.Nonsense . I am the Duc de Croytor . Besides I never barge . I always make an entrance.Caravan is nonsense though fun at times around the middle when MacLean gets going with a clever reverse chase between Bowman and the Gypsies . He 's chasing them chasing him . There 's a good opening too of a Gypsy 's murder which MacLean paints darkly and well.But as the story progresses it becomes harder to follow . MacLean gets caught up in the sport of playing with reader expectations . You think one thing is going to happen so something else does instead . Nearly every character has a hidden identity one has two . The back end of Caravan becomes one confusing aboutface after another winding up in a toocute tidy resolution with one character calling out Encore ! No thanks.Also weak is the Gypsy angle which is never explored in any great depth . You feel like he made the bad guys Gypsies just because it would make for good cover art.I was amused by some of this book and enjoyed its first half pretty well . But a thin setting and confusing narrative really brought me up short . I had no problem reading the book it 's MacLean and something to make a flight pass quickly . But Caravan To Vaccares is the kind of book that gives airplane fiction a bad name . ",1
"Caravan to Vaccares is a wellplotted espionage tale set in Europe against the backdrop of a wandering gypsy caravan.It 's not without humor and it 's a fast moving story . However the book lacks the characterizations of Maclean 's earlier books especially those dealing with World War II.The books he produced after this novel seem hastily written . Pick this one instead of Seawitch and Way to Dusty Death.Recommended especially for Maclean fans . ",2
"Hey folksIt may sound like a clich & eacute but I really did grow up reading MacLean 's stories . I was in elementary school when he first published H.M.S . Ulysses and I was captured by it . When he followed it with Guns of Navarone it seemed he switched from his naval story to more of a thriller genre . It did not matter I liked everything he did . By the mid 1980s I suspect MacLean had more novels made into films than any other author to that time.I have to admit I did not find this book quite as good as so many of his others but it is still a fun MacLean story . The shortcomings I find in this book are mainly in the credibility of the Bowman and Le Duc characters . They do stretch credulity a bit too far and Le Duc seems more like a tongueincheek Ian Flemming character . In spite of this however this is still an enjoyable MacLean story . I just finished reading it for the third or fourth time since 1970 and I still had a thrill reading it.Best wishesDave Wile ",3
"Alistair Maclean 's Caravan to Vacares opens with the pursuit to the death of a man somehow connected to annual Gypsy caravans to France . The scene then shifts to a restaurant where two young Englishwomen on holiday are seemingly by chance paired with a older French nobleman and gourmand and a younger man named Bowman who claims no occupation at all . Maclean takes his time filling in the clues that connect these two events and this results in the somewhat unusual pacing of Caravan.At the heart of the plotline is a smuggling operation by the Gypsies that has attracted international law enforcement attention but Maclean devotes most of the novel to the adventures of Neil Bowman . Bowman turns out to have both very unique job skills and the unfortunate knack of drawing murderous attempts on his life . His pairing with one of the young Englishwomen provides Maclean with the opportunity for a rather chaste romance and some sharp repartee between the two . The two must overcome various obstacles including a nearly fatal encounter in a bullring while stringing together the clues that will solve the case . As with any Maclean novel very little is as it first seems . Unlike most Maclean novels the twists and turns of the story are a little harder to follow than usual.This novel is highly recommended to Alistair Maclean fans and to readers looking for an entertaining story .

"MacLean never wrote a better novel than this his first.For those who love the sea and yet respect her fearsome savagry HMS Ulysses satisfies . Brilliant character development superb technical detail.HMS Ulysses is a good novel more than that the book pays tribute to both the Royal Navy and the Merchant Marine and homage in equal measure to all German British American . It reminds us that brave men sailed the North Atlantic and that courage knows no boundaries.The book follows the fortunes of a fighting ship whose crew is slowly selfdestructing after months of convoy duty in the North Atlantic . They are offered the prospect of a break in the Mediterranean if they can complete one final convoy to Russia through the murderous North Atlantic and thereby atone for a mutiny that has left two people deadTheir voyage and ultimate atonement tests the mettle of all on board and challenges the base assumptions we tend to make about the inherant goodness of Humanity . It will leave you pondering how you would have responded under similar circumstances and perhaps may leave you less than satisfied with what you learn about yourself.As a tale it compares well with Noel Coward 's wartime movie In Which We Serve . MacLean paints his tale with prosaic pictures that stay in your mind more persistently than any film could . The final image of the HMS Ulysses with battle ensign flying stays with you long after you put the book down.MacLean 's book reminds us that things like this happened every day once . It is a reminder of the gallantry of a generation that is fast disappearing . ",4
"Probably one of the best ever WWII naval novels . The writing made you feel you were part of the crew living with characters like Valerie and the Kapok Kid . Not only the crew but you felt you were part of the ship and all that happened to her . A book you could n't put down nor one you wanted to put down . ",4
"One of this author 's best books . I have read the book three times in the last fifty years and each time the appalling conditions suffered by men on warships and merchantmen alike jumps out of the page . The conditions and tactics experienced by all the men involved are superbly drawn by MacLean . One of my very favourite naval books . ",4
"I wanted to like this book but I could not . Maclean seems to have an encyclopedic knowledge of life aboard a cruiser but the naval strategy that drives the book seems nonsensical . Go read C.S . Forrester 's The Ship to see a better handling of life aboard a ship in battle . SPOILERS But the real problem with this particular book is that almost every single character is killed off . They either have a spectacularly gruesome death or die in an act of suicidal bravery or more likely both . How much of this can you take as reader ? There 's not a single bright spot in this whole book . Every time you think the mood is lifting with some character redeeming himself by an heroic act he is either blown to smithereens or frozen to death within a page or two.There 's not even any logic to it all . The idea that the Admiralty would sacrifice an entire convoy just to draw out the Tirpitz is stupid . The goal of the Admiralty was to get convoys through not sink German warships . It 's the convoys that would win the war.I think Maclean was on some sort of medication when he wrote this . It 's a complete downer from start to finish . ",0
"This novel has been inexplicably compared to Nicholas Monsarrat 's post WWII naval classic The Cruel Sea . Although a fan of MacLean 's I could not get beyond the first 65 pages . ",0
"I would rate this higher if I could . There are n't in my opinion enough superlatives to do this stirring Naval story justice . It 's the story of the heroic H.M.S Ulysses and her crew who are ordered to undertake the escort of a convoy to Russia across the merciless and dangerous North Atlantic . For a crew that is at the end of it 's tether after months of battle it 's almost beyond belief.It 's a story of survival for both the Ulysses and her crew against insurmountable odds . A story of men who have been pushed beyond their mental emotional and physical limits who do n't at first realise that they will be called upon to give even more.It 's a journey fraught with difficulty battle against enemy air attack roving UBoats harrying the convoy at every opportunity . Then there is the harsh and unrelenting environment cold inducing frostbite angry seas freak waves unrelenting storms exhaustion.The writing is descriptive you can almost feel yourself aboard the rolling ice encrusted decks of the Ulysses . There is a wonderful cross section of characters who are well fleshed out . It 's a stirring heroic story that will stay in a reader 's mind . ",4
"What a glorious end to a great ship and wonderful crew . Alistair Maclean masterfully mixes the glories of warfare with the utter waste and senselessness of such conflicts . ",4

"H.M.S . Ulysses was famed author Alistair Maclean 's very first novel a raw emotional and thinlydisguised account of a British warship on the Murmansk Convoys of World War II . The convoys carried war material to the Soviet port of Murmansk in the high Arctic under the guns of Nazi planes and ship operating out of occupied Norway . Between the frigid weather and the Nazis convoy losses were extremely high.The warship of the title suffers the disgrace of a mutiny aboard ship after too many days and nights on the convoys . The British Admiralty short on escorts sends the ship and crew straight out again on a voyage of redemption.Maclean 's service in the Royal Navy during World War II included time on the Murmansk convoys he populates the crew of H.M.S . Ulysses with the kind of battleweary men he served with and their portraits ring true . These were men with no illusions about themselves or their chances for survival and no loyalties save to the ship and their shipmates . Among the most memorable is Captain Vallery the Commander a dutydriven almost saintly man slowly dying of tuberculois but unwilling to abandon his crew . His sacrifice is only one of many portrayed by Maclean an ordinary seaman 's refusal to leave his post under fire even to save his own life is made believable and memorable.H.M.S . Ulysses and its crew will strive to the very end few readers will be unmoved by the penultimate scene of the book . This book is highly recommended to fans of Alistair Maclean and to others looking for a firstrate reading experience . ",4
"With HMS Ulysses his first novel Alistair MacLean established himself as a writer with a flair for action humor and pulsepounding plots . He showed a penchant for capturing the heroism of men in tough spots the cold of icy environments and the crash of the waves on the high seas . He gained fame through books such as Ice Station Zebra The Guns of Navarone and Where Eagles Dare but some of his later books seemed to devolve into predictable affairs.HMS Ulysses still stands as a remarkable first novel and as a classic of war on the sea . With nailbiting scenes and teethgrinding suspense the story shows the fight for survival of men aboard a ship . I miss the straightforward storytelling of dear Mr. MacLean . I sincerely hope his books remain with us to be passed to the next generation . ",4
"I loved this book when I read it years ago and carried the memory of it . However on rereading there 's a dated feel to the writing probably due to our changed needs and perceptions of modern books . It is still a gripping and very sad war story . The Murmansk convoys and the men who served on those ships should never be forgotten . And the fact that the book is written by one of those men has impact . Read and remember but do n't expect to feel good at the end . ",3
"MacLean 's account of the desperate fate of a wartime convoy to Russia is his magnum opus . A detailed study of the human condition in the most extreme circumstances imaginable.Puts modern day complaints about hardship into stark perspective.Everyone should read this to understand the generation who fought in WW2 .

"This is MacLean as I love him writing about the cold sea competent men and miserable circumstances.I am going to tell you all sorts of plot points on the theory that this book is 20 years older than I am.We start with an abortive mutiny .

They are pretty sure that they do not want to do this again . However the ship is sent out again under the auspices of the kindly overworked doctor the kindly stoic captain and the kindly admiral . The whole book could really be titled HMS Ulysses and the Terrible Horrible NoGood Very Bad Convoy . In only a rough semblance of order here are SOME of the things that happened .

Admiral goes crazy Admiral dies of frostbiteamputation Bad apple saves the engineer who gave him a chanceReally it was like a microcosm of horsemen what with the war pestilence TB starvation and death .

It was just the sort of adventure book I love full of hard luck and people pulling through anyway.Amazingly some few battered survivors lived to tell the story . ",3
"This is a gripping tale of survival on the high seas during World War II .

Now they must contend with ever present dangers like Nazi Uboats and Luftwaffe attacks not to mention equal or greater danger from the angry ocean . As the crew realizes stricken ships and their crew can rarely be rescued because the other ships must keep moving or share a similar fate . Of course how long could a sailor survive in those frigid waters anyway ? Among the memorable characters are Captain Vallery an ill but dutydriven man and more than one ordinary seaman that define duty and bravery . Readers feel as if they are there aboard the ship as they dare angry seas fog and everpresent danger of Nazi Uboats surface ships and Luftwaffe . This was the first novel by Alistair MacLean 19221987 a worthy fastpaced naval thriller.For those that do n't know the Murmansk run brought vital war supplies from the USA and Britain to Soviet Russia but it involved a hazardous sailing trip from Britain and up around Nazioccupied Norway . After reading this book as a teen I met a veteran of those deathdefying runs and his face expressed many memories of his harrowing experience . ",4
"What exceptional story of naval combat ! Alistair MacLean gives us the best of his work . The story is that of a Marine convoy comprising warships and vessels civilians merchants the departure of British coast to Russia . However packs of Uboats attacked the convoy without respite . In the cold snow the misery of war these episodes glaze your blood.25 years after reading this book I remember many vivid passages . A book of great emotion . ",4
"At first I found reallyhard to follow this book since there were many specific terms of the naval language English is not my native language . However the adventures and the endurance of the crew really made the book fascinating and emotionally intriguing . The non happy ending is another peculiar feature of the book.I really enjoyed reading the book and I would recommend it to anyone . ",4
"A staggeringly good book that has stood the test of time . I bought this in 1973 and regularly reread it . The quality of the writing measured by its flow and and the atmosphereimages it generates jumps at you from the very first page with the meeting and showdown in Scapa Flow.The characters are very well drawn even Commander Orr whom we meet in person for just a few seconds but one empathises with him from the descriptions of his actions and his signals throughout the book . One image that will remain with me is of the Stirling in the last quarter of the book . Whyhow can I become so emotional about what normally would seem to be an inanimate object ? It can only be due to the quality of the writing.There 's been discussion about making a film . The time to do that was several decades ago dare one say when the world was filmed in black and white . My suggestion is to read this book then watch 'The Cruel Sea ' . I ca n't imagine the present generation of 'Hollywood ' actors conveying the stresses and resolve of Alistair Maclean 's characters and we certainly do not need whizbang CGI special effects . This is a book about gritty determination and strength of character those of us who have never served in the Armed Forces should learn a lot of life 's lessions from it . ",4
"I just reread HMS Ulysses after about a 30 year hiatus . I do n't think anyone has capture the desolate cold and terrorfilled world of the Arctic Convoy run from Halifax to Archangel like MacLean . It is a classic unforgetable photograph of a brief period in history when men with undaunting courage loyalty and almost superhuman endurance put their lives at risk in unparalled sacrifice . ",4
"MacLean 's first novel this is easily his best . It is a little different than his usual adventurethrillers . This is a serious book about the naval war of World War II . The North Atlantic convoy runs saw some of the highest casualties during the war and MacLean puts the reader squarely in the middle of that icy Nordic hell . What happens when men are pushed far too far makes for some of the most gripping reading around . ",4
"MacLean 's HMS Ulysses is a classic book of man against man but more importantly man against the sea . Set in the brutal Murmansk Run this book is an account of the men of a ship marked out from the rest of the Royal Navy by a resistance to discipline . The crew is rebelling against mindless authority but is still ready to do its duty along the lines of the great Mutiney of 1797 when ships of the Royal Navy effectively deposed brutal and mindless officers but always maintained that it would up anchor and fight any attackers . The men of Ulysses strike me as linear descendants of the sailors fighting Napoleon 's fleet.There is a great cross section of British society in the officers and men of Ulysses from aristocratic flag officers to gentleman rankers in the lower rates . Petty tyrants and officers one would gladly follow anywhere . MacLean has included them all and made it work to perfection in his tale.THe constant theme is not the brutality of war or men killing each other but the constant battle with the sea in all its many forms . MacLean 's attention to detail gives an almost 'you are there ' quality to his writing . The reader feels he is right there on the bow of Ulysses as it gets underway for one more run to Murmansk to being on the bridge in her ultimate engagement with the German Navy . You can almost feel the bone breaking cold whenever you are placed out on deck . MacLean puts you right in the middle of it.If any of MacLean 's books deserve to be made into movies this is one that is long overdue.I found this book to be one that I did n't want to put down . I felt the charecters were all extremely well developed men that were almost real . I do n't know if MacLean was in the Royal Navy during World War II but reading this book I certainly get that impression . This is a classic in Naval literature . ",4
"This was Alistair Maclean 's first book and what a book to have written.A ship has to make a run to Murmansk during the height of the Second World War battling dreadful seas and the marauding enemy . On board there are a crew who are wornout and on the verge of mutiny . There is the Captain who is deathly ill . Conditions could not be worse.This is a tale of great bravery under the worst of circumstances . Maclean using a third person narrative tells the tales of a number of characters well and although at times he becomes a little melodramatic he writes a novel that is justifiably regarded a classic of the sea.It is a book that starts off a little slowly but builds up to a dramatic ending . ",4
"In his other work MacLean is an adventurespy writer . The stories are interesting some of the work and dialogue cliche'd.H.M.S Ulysses is different . Much different.I had an uncle who commanded an escort in the North Atlantic and went to Murmansk at least once . His view of the book which he recommended to me was that it was perfect in every detail.While there is the suggestion that MacLean puts together everything that could happen to a convoy and happened to some or many of them at one time or another into one story the fact is that it remains perfectly feasible that the convoy is hit by unbelievable Arctic storms air attacks submarine attacks and a surface raider.Some books write of cold but if you read this book you will be cold . Some write of fatigue . If you read this book your eyes will burn and your face will feel as if it 's sliding off your head . Some write of despair . If you read this book you will understand going on and on despite there being no hope simply because that 's what you 've been doing.MacLean 's characters make mistakes . The admiral orders a tactical turn which results in several ships being torpedoed . He realizes that his tactics are old and predictable . The Germans set him up because he was not sufficiently aggressive with himself . An officer orders guns to fire before the tompions are out and several men are killed . This is the way it is . War involves among other things a sharp and determined enemy who will mess you up and use yourself against you.Kipling refers to the drowsy second 's lack of thought that costs a dozen dead in a poem referring to adolescent naval officers in WW I . These are men who should be hospitalized but instead are forced to operate on overdrive every moment of every day with no relief in sight.In other books you will read of the immense tonnage of war materials brought to the USSR during the war . The numbers stagger the imagination . This book explains the cost . Good men . Good men all . All gone.Read this for entertainment . Read it to know how much you owe to men you 've never heard of .

"My grandfather was a Master Mariner qualified in both steam and sail and he was also a captain on these Murmansk convoys on a merchant vessel . There was no armour plate for him or rapidfire Oerlikon guns just a few outdated machines guns and the selfish hope that it would happen to someone else . He could not outrun the bombers or the torpedo a little zigzagging was the most he could manage and pray that his colleagues in the destroyers and other warships would look after them and that his engineer would keep the steam pressure up.His enemies were the German Navy and AirForce and the incessant Arctic weather . There was no hiding place or port of respite the supplies had to get through the ammunition oil guns and tanks the bricks and mortar of war . If the merchant ships sank soldiers were left unable to fight or planes could not take off these thoughts were always in the sailors ' minds . It was always the sacrifice of the few for the good of the many.The crews of these warships were the forgotten heroes toiling in the cold damp dark chambers of these warships stoking the boilers minding the pumps carrying the ammunition knowing that in the event of a leak the hatches would be sealed above them and the would drown or suffocate whilst they were separated from torpedoes and gunshells by a thin layer of steel instant death was a second away . The admirals and captains got the fame and credit but it was paid for by the flesh and blood of the ratings and those marines who volunteered to serve aboard.This book just tells it like it was . ",4
"The HMS Ulysses was built for one mission escorting convoys from Scotland to Murmansk in Russia to deliver supplies Russia needs to keep the Wehrmacht on the run on the eastern front . By 1943 the tide of the war had turned against the Axis on every front but the Atlantic . Worn down by the arctic storms by constant attacks from German subs dive bombers and cruisers by outbreaks of TB and the constant threat of the mighty Battleship Tirpitz Ulysses is a ship coming apart at the seams . The only thing holding the crew and ship together is there respect for its young and ailing captain and the desperation of the allied war effort . Their superiors in Admiralty would gladly supply less outdated escorts with more experienced crews or replace their undersized and outgunned escort jeep carriers with fleet aircraft carriers if that were available . But disintegrate the ship does under attack by uboats Hipperclass cruisers Condor bombers and the ceaseless assault of the Arctic . McLean does a superlative job taking both crew and vaunted ship apart . While he does n't glorify war he does n't stoop at taking cheap shots at those who lead the wareffort either and those who made critical decisions leading up to the tragedy of convoy PQ17 are given their due . do n't worry if you do n't know a thing about PQ17 McLean gives aperfect intro . Neither does McLean stoop to gory effects . Ulysses neither glorifies war nor condemns it with cheap tactics . The horrors of war are enough for that and McLean 's prose do that sort of like Private Ryan at sea . ",3
"I 've always been a great fan of Alistair McLean books with this being one of his best . I love the classy look of these Heron Editions and would highly recommend them ! ",4
"I read it as a teenager and was deeply impressed my first grown up book . So I read it for the third time now 67 years old and it has lost nothing of its coldness and horror . Living in Iceland I might get a still better understanding . ",4
"No words can describe this Master story telling . This was the beginning of MacLeans career and showed his tremendous skill . You will not just read it once but many times and you will laugh and cry each time . ",4
"I know I 'm the odd person out here because virtually all the reviews are favorable & amp some consider this work a classic but frankly I did n't like this book . And mind you I like war novels & amp have read many of them . This book is unrelievedly gloomy & amp depressing & amp gets more so as the book goes on . There is way too much description & amp not enough conversation . Contrary to what several reviewers said I found the character development weak to nonexistent . There were some interesting characters & amp I would have liked to know more about them but the characters took second place to endless descriptions of the weather & amp damage reports . I plowed through it because I thought it was my duty to do so but really I found this book disappointing . ",1
"I 've read several of Alistair Macleans books seen the movies of his famous Guns of NavaroneIce Station Zebra and the others but I 'd never come across this his first novel . Thought it would be interesting as my father had been in the Royal Navy during WWII and did North Atlantic Convoy runs similar but not quite as cold as the Artic Convoys described in HMS Ulysses to supply Russia with much needed medical and military armaments.From the very begining of the book to the end it was gripping I devoured it.The constant tension hardship and vigilence the weakness and courage of each character was awesome not a word I frequently use but this story is awesome.We follow the H.M.S.Ulysses on her last Artic Convoy before promised deployment in the Mediterranean . Nothing goes as planned despite the senior officers capabilities . The unrelenting cold poor nutrition disease and psychological stress just keep on coming . The characters are plausable fully realized and capable of truely heroic actions while being vulnerable and very human . No amount of planning training or experience is possible for the unexpected that they find in this harshest of conditions.It 's not an easy read but I think it 's his best novel I 've recommened it to all my family and friends.I know this story and it 's characters will stay with me for a very very long time .

"Alastair Maclean 's books tend to run along formulaic lines the good guy good humouredly taking a fearful beating the bad guy snarlingly getting his eventual comeuppance . Whether it 's a Formula One race track an island in the Barents Sea or a submarine beneath the polar ice cap the pattern is unshakeable . Not bad you understand but familiar.This book however is completely different . Mr Maclean served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War and took part in several convoys similar to those described in this book . His experiences have coloured his writing and given this book an immediacy and a depth that the others lack . This book serves as a tribute to the men that lost their lives in the fearful Arctic Convoys of World War Two a critical theatre of war that was largely forgotten . ",4
"The book 's title refers to the first circle of Hell in Dante 's Inferno . This is the least oppressive level of Hell . The prison camp described in this book offers plenty of food to the prisoners no backbreaking physical labor and a warm bed . Most of Stalin 's prison camps are located in Siberia where the prisoners freeze and starve . What accounts for Stalin 's leniency ? The prisoners are scientists working on top secret projects like a telephone for Stalin 's use that ca n't be tapped and a system of identifying anonymous voices on public telephones by the voice prints similar to finger prints . In Stalin 's evil country you are not innocent until proven guilty . You are guilty as soon as you are arrested . One prisoner was put in jail because his neighbors wanted his family 's apartment and made up an unsupported lie about him . They got the apartment and destroyed his life and family . Most of the prisoners were WW2 vets POWs returning from Germany . They were n't welcomed home with appreciation and honor . They were lured home by lies and immediately imprisoned.There are many great characters . You 'll remember Nerzhin and his wife and wonder how things will work out for them . You 'll remember Rubin the sincere communist caught in the web of the system he believes in . You 'll remember Innokenty Volodin in trouble for doing a good deed as innocent as his first name . When you read a mediocre book there are no characters to remember just a predictable formulaic storyline and a group of people and events you find hard to believe . This is a rare opportunity for you to be a fly on the wall halfway around the world observing life in a Russian prison camp . The reason I give it only 4 stars is because I like happy endings and resolved problems . This book would make a good movie . There 's plenty of room for a sequel which has n't been written where we can find a satisfactory ending for some of the characters . Stalin the insane sewer rat died eventually and was denounced by Khrushchev so maybe in time these people were allowed to live out the rest of their lives in freedom . ",3
"I was first introdced to Solzhenitsyn 's works when I was a freshman in high school far too many years ago in a little town . The book was the Volume 1 of The Gulag Archipelago . It was really an eyeopener for me in so many ways given that it was the first really serious book that I 'd read.I believe that Solzhenitsyn is the best writer of the 20th century or at least he 's the top writer I 've read so far and I 've read a lot of books . Maybe that 's influenced by my early exposure but I do n't think so I find his works just as compelling now as I did then.The First Circle is one of his most accessible works that is you can just jump in and start reading and probably one of his best . A very compelling story his portraits of the various vile creatures of the Soviet government have been shown to be quite accurate and the way the various plots intertwine and are resolved is wonderful.The First Circle gives great insight into a culture totally foreign to most US citizens as the book 's a mixture of spy novel guide to life in a Gulag camp and brief introduction to Soviet society of the 1950s . A depressing place to be sure but fascinating . Well worth reading . ",4
"This book will absolutely challenge your political and spiritual ideas no matter what they are ! I was brought to my knees in gratitude for the freedom we have in America after finishing this book . A true miracle that it ever got published with all the KGB attacks and threats . A MUST READ ! ",4
"This immense story amazingly spans only a few days in the lives of several people unduly imprisoned by Joseph Stalin 's secret police . Unlike the senseless horror of the gulag The First Circle involves the incarceration of select and highly skilled prisoners in a relatively privileged Soviet prison which is really set up as a research laboratory where these skilled inmates are exploited for their expertise . Here after they 've been arrested under any number of false pretenses they are forced to invent and develop elaborate electronic devices which will help in the detection and arrest of any other subversives . The main gadget that they are called upon to produce is a phonoscopy a device that will be able to accurately identify a person by examining recorded conversation.Right from the opening tense chapters Solzhenitsyn once again had me in his grip . For me he is the master at capturing the foreboding sense of loss of freedom . It is palpable in some ways worse than outright murder because you know that whatever happens to his characters they are going to have to LIVE through it they are n't even afforded the luxury of dying . At one point he used the phrases trampled yearnings & amp soaring passion in one sentence and it stuck with me and I feel it summarizes what his characters face here in TFC . In ch.34 the protagonist Gleb Nerzhin is musing with a fellow inmate on the hardships of imprisonment and he concludes that of all his deprivations by far the worst is the loss of freedom to be with his wife . She is allowed a visit once a year and even then he is not allowed to kiss her . Hearing this his cellmate Gerasimovich concludes that there is probably only one path to invulnerability to kill within oneself ALL attachments and to renounce ALL desires.This book looks deeply into the process of passivity that creeps into and consumes the life of the imprisoned . Also there are times when it reminds us of the resiliency of the human spirit in the midst of numbing regret and longing . I am thinking of the unforgettable scene of Rubin following the guard toward the end of ch.67.There is a passage in ch.84 which I think wonderfully capsulizes what Solzhenitsyn is telling us here in TFC Unfortunately for people and fortunately for their rulers a human being is so constituted that as long as he lives there is always something more that can be taken away from him . Even a person imprisoned for life deprived of movement of the sky of family of property can for instance be transferred to a damp punishment cell deprived of hot food beaten with clubs and he will feel these petty extra punishments as intensely as his earlier downfall from the heights of freedom and affluence . To avoid these final torments the prisoner follows obediently the humiliating and hateful prison regime which slowly kills the human being within him.This is not a happilyeverafter book . We may be able to deny ourselves the luxury of exposure to Solzhenitsyn 's themes but one thing we can not deny is the fact that his books are based upon things that actually happened in history . Because they did . And they do . Here is one of the finest writers of the 20th Century and this is his masterpiece . ",4
"The theme of this book is not prison camps it is nothing more narrow than life itself . And it is almost as rich in characters and stories within stories here Solzhenitsyn is very like Tolstoy as life constancy in love artistic integrity the whimspy of fate literacy in Medieval Novgorod the prison in the Count of Monte Cristo snow how to sew the law of unintended consequences.A few major abiding themes run like threads throughout the book providing unity First the life of the zek the prisoner in Stalin 's camps . Second loneliness not just of prisoners longing for a woman or lost loved ones or of persecuted wives trying to make lives for themselves but ultimately of each person . Every conversation carries a different meaning for the people involved . The author gets inside of peoples heads in an amazing way from the janitor Spiridon to the Best Friend of CounterIntelligence Operatives Joseph Stalin himself . Third and on a deeper level integrity both artistic and moral.Fourth and I do n't know if this was the conscious intent of the author or not the book reminds us of the unity of Western civilization . Aside from mentions of Tolstoy Dostoevski Pushkin and Lermontov which I might add also describes the company Solzhenitsyn belongs in with honor the book is honeycombed with references to the great thinkers and artists of European civilization from the ancient Greeks and the Gospels to Dante the Holy Grail Bach and Beethoven . The Marxist Rubin even quotes Luther . Primarily no doubt this is a reflection of the fact that the prisoners in the sharashkas the topsecret scientific work camps were educated men unlike say the hero of his shorter novel One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich . The contrast Solzhenitsyn draws to their wellpaid Neanderthal captors is just one form of the irony that is his most distinctive and powerful stylistic weapon . But even the Neanderthals including Stalin himself are portrayed not as cardboard villains but with insight and imagination . These references also remind us that as much as Solzhenitsyn has been accused of being a Slavophobe as if that were an insult the Russian culture he loves is an integral part of Western civilization . This iconic dialogue of the ages similiar to the works of great Chinese painters also adds another layer of delight to the book.The final and greatest thread that unifies this work is the idea of achieving humanity of becoming what a person ought to be of heroism . The prisoners are poets eccentric and philosophers though there are also scoundrels and everyone is tempted that way beaten down by life and the forces of disolution within trying to preserve their souls or civilization from the barbarians who are their masters . In describing the simple heroism of some of his characters Solzhenitsyn achieves brilliance . In my opinion First Circle is the greatest of his works and one of the most powerful pieces of writing of the 20th Century at least . And it is not about the Gulag primarily it is about what it means to be human and the choices we all face.Aside from the characters and stories many of the scenes are wonderful again like Tolstoy of Rubin standing in the courtyard at night in the snow when he hears the train whistle of the party at the prosecutor 's house of the arrest of the diplomat . If life is sometimes too strange for fiction and it is there are also pieces of fiction that seem truer than life . First Circle is a marriage of style and substance made in heaven or at least the highest circle of hell.author Jesus and the Religions of Man ",4
"Maybe the fault is with the translator or maybe it is because the author is really a mathematician but i found this book leaden and uninspiring . The prose are workmanlike to say the least . The dialogue is stilted and would sound at home in mouths of Dostoyevsky 's or Turgenev 's creatures.Aside from the hero the characters and their voices are undifferentiated . The women are two dimensional like figures constructed from formulas of femininity rather than real women drawn from life.The same is true of Solzhenitsyn 's play of ideas . One theory trotted out after another . The characters who orate them as simply mouthpieces for the author 's erudition . As didactic as a textbook . All that 's missing is footnotes . Of course it was not possible for the publisher to refine and polish the text in collaboration with the author as all the great novels of the 20th C were so we really ca n't expect it to live on the page as do the great novels of the 20th C. Still I ca n't help but think Solzhenitsyn 's Nobel was for his politics than his prose . Is he really the equal of his contemporary honorees Kawabata Beckett Boll or Neruda ? The great power of The First Circle is its insight into Stalin 's terror . But there are many other books on this theme many of them much better . Koestler'sDarkness at Noonsprings first to mind . Nadezhda Mandelstam'sHope Against Hope A Memoiris the undisputed masterpiece of the genreand the has the benefit of being all true . Every page of that wrenching memoir is as soul searing as as as a poem byAkhmatova another victim and survivor of the terror . There are even academic books written with more style and feeling than The First Circle.Stalin The Court of the Red Tsarfor instance . And the works of Bruce Lincoln Sunlight at Midnight St. Petersburg and the Rise of Modern Russia who was a superb writer as well as historian.I know that Russian is near impossible to translate yet there are so many works of grace and power available to us in English . With so many great and truly moving books about the horrors of the Soviet Revolution Stalin 's reign and life in the camps and asylums I can not recommend this lumpen tome . ",0
"Where are the all the cybercommunists calling this book lies as they do Robert Conquest 's The Great Terror ? If you enjoy the human spirit squirting away from under the totalitarian heel then you 'll love this book which is packed tight with erudition and acute observation . ",4
"Like Solzhenitsyn 's first literary work the novella One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich his first fulllength novel The First Circle is an autobiographical work based upon his experiences as a political prisoner of the Soviet regime . The title is an allusion to Dante 's first circle of Hell in The Divine Comedy that being the circle reserved for virtuous pagans especially the ancient Greek and Roman philosophers who because of their paganism were denied entry to Heaven but because of their virtue were not otherwise punished.The novel is set in Mavrino a place which can be considered part of the First Circle of the Soviet penal system . Mavrino a former stately home now converted to a sharashka or special prison is a very different place to the Gulag described in One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich . It is not situated in Siberia or some other remote part of the country but in the Moscow suburbs . The prisoners who are mostly intellectuals especially scientists engineers or mathematicians are adequately fed and enjoy good working conditions . They are put to work on technical projects of use to the Soviet military or to the MVD the organisation which was later to become the KGB.The novel is unusual in that there is no single main character . One of the prisoners the mathematician Gleb Nerzhin is said to be an autobiographical character based upon Solzhenitsyn himself but several other characters are given equal prominence . Instead we are introduced to a wide crosssection of the prisoners some of the guards officials and free workers in the prison as well as a few outsiders . What can be described as the main plot is set in motion when Innokenty Volodin an official at the Soviet Foreign Ministry makes a telephone call to a doctor friend warning him not to give samples of a new drug to a French colleague as he fears that such an action could be construed as espionage by the authorities . Unfortunately for Volodin the call has been recorded by the secret police and a copy of the recording is sent to Mavrino where some of the prisoners are already working on a project to invent a system of voiceprints which will enable an individual to be infallibly identified from a recording of his voice.The main action takes place over only three days December 25th27th 1949 but there are numerous flashbacks which Solzhenitsyn uses to fill in the background of his characters . We learn that few if any of the prisoners have committed serious crimes most are either guilty of trivial offences or else have been framed by the authorities normally under the notorious Article 58 of the Soviet Penal Code which defined counterrevolutionary activity and which enabled Stalin to imprison as enemies of the people any opponents of the Communist system or of his rule . Solzhenitsyn himself was sentenced to ten years imprisonment for some unflattering remarks he made about the big boss in a private letter which was intercepted by the military censors.The main philosophical theme of the novel is the moral dilemma facing the prisoners . They are acutely aware that they are much better off than the prisoners in the regular Gulags but some have moral scruples about working for the system that is responsible for their suffering especially as many of the projects they are working on are designed to help the secret police track down and capture other dissidents . The book ends with several prisoners including Nerzhin and the physicist Illarion Gerasimovich being transferred to the much harsher regime of the labour camps after they refuse to cooperate with the authorities . Contrasting with their attitude is that of another prisoner the philologist Lev Rubin who is a key worker on the voiceprint project . Despite his imprisonment Rubin remains a convinced Communist and supporter of the Soviet system who carries out his work enthusiastically . It is his research that leads to the arrest not only of Volodin but also of his totally innocent colleague Shchevronok . The voiceprint system is not as foolproof as Rubin had hoped and he is forced to admit that he can not be certain which of the two men made the fatal telephone call . To be on the safe side therefore the authorities arrest them both.This does not necessarily mean that Rubin is the villain of the novel indeed he is said to be based on Solzhenitsyn 's friend and fellowdissident Lev Kopelev . On a personal level Rubin is intelligent cultured and humane . Solzhenitsyn 's quarrel is not with the man himself but rather with the ideology he represents and with the end justifies the means mentality which that ideology fosters . Rubin believes that anything that furthers the interests of the Party will also further the interests of mankind so if the Party 's interests require that men be murdered tortured or unjustly imprisoned then murder torture and unjust imprisonment even his own are morally justified.Indeed there are remarkably few villains in the novel apart from reallife individuals such as Stalin and his brutal Minister of State Security Viktor Abakumov . Stalin is briefly but memorably depicted as a paranoid and selfpitying megalomaniac . Although Mavrino has its fair share of brutal guards and venal stoolpigeons Solzhenitsyn reveals a certain sympathy even for the officials in charge of the prison such as the Head of Research Colonel Yakanov confronted with the impossible demands of his superiors who in turn are placed in an impossible position by the demands of the Party leaders . Even Abakumov lives in constant fear of Stalin.During my youth in the 1970s and 1980s Solzhenitsyn was a much talkedabout author in the West although or perhaps because his work was banned in Russia . He was hailed on the political Right and also by some on the nonCommunist Left as one of the Soviet Union 's most prominent dissidents . With the end of the Cold War however the position was reversed . Although his works could now be published in Russia interest in him in the West began to wane his conservative Russian nationalism his adherence to the Orthodox faith his support for President Putin and his trenchant criticisms of Western materialism made him an unlikely ally for many of those Westerners who had once feted him . Reading The First Circle for the first time made me wonder if we had in fact feted him for the wrong reasons for transient political rather than artistic ones . Although he was indeed a strong critic of the Soviet system he was more than that . Like others among his works the book is a powerful testament to the power of the human spirit to meet hardship and oppression with stoicism and dignity . ",4
"This novel is set in what passes for the best of the worst Research duty for exGulag inmates who know what misery really is . Working on idiotic deadlines set in response to Stalin 's quirks the prisonerscientists live in a world of denial and unreality akin to Dilbert on crack . A worse fate befalls their jailermanagers who are free agents of the government and must justify repeatedly failing to meet the ridiculous deadlines that their bosses set out of fear of offending The Boss which typically ends in either immediate execution or in joining the ranks of those in chains.Some things that stood out as I read this book were the universality of the bureaucratic mindset avoidance of responsibility inertia as a policy stonewalling and turfmanship all in place of actual achievement or progress in any meaningful way . Another thing is the prevalence of a falseaccuser culture where anonymus denouncements can destroy the innocent quickly without explanation or even a trace . Given the state of our own society today and the riskreward calculus that favors the accuser this trait appeared even more ominous to me as I read the book . The denial that gripped some of the inmates either wholly Rubin or partially Nehrzin in the beginning and others about why they were in prison reminded me of The Matrix in that they were dreamwalking through life in a mist of MarxistCommunist mumbojumbo rationalizing their fates as random chance a mistake the failing of the system even but almost never as an understanding of their suffering being inherent in the System itself . As Nehrzin awakes to this to a degree and the author may be semiautobiographical in his sketch of this character like himself a decorated artillery officer imprisoned over virtually nothing he opens his eyes to the existence of the matrix of lies false theory supporting false gods etc . that has fully ensnared Russia and all within her power hostage not only to Stalin 's perversity creeping madness and hurbis but to a system that is itself a reflection of all of these characteristics too . The xenophobic search for American spies undermining Motherland security under every bush the rewriting of history to support the current lies and the occasional mind that breaks free by rejecting those lies as Nehrzin did starting in his youth reminds one of Ayn Rand 's We the Living.Echoing 1984 the older prisoners remember things as they were before the official history filled men 's minds . Things had been different than they were being told better materially and spiritually . The prisoners themselves were frequently veterans those who had done the most for the State reaping an unlookedfor reward like Belisarius blinded by a jealous Justinian left to beg in the streets . The theme of war and survival is a thread that binds the veterans either prisoner or free to each other . A bond of another kind exists between the inmates and their women the latter mostly loyal giving up their youth and the possibility of starting a family waiting for a release that may never come sustained by the rare visit that bureaucratic stonewalling and trickery tries to prevent their love provides a flicker of hope in the ashes of their ruined lives where even being suspected of marriage to a political criminal was enough to make earning a living an impossibility since the State was sole employer.Something else that seemed relevant to America today was the culture war that Yaralov an exprisoner now running a research lab as a Colonel remembers while pondering his posible return to zek status from his youth . He gave up the love of a Christian girl because while the Orthodox Church was legal in the 1920s it was not politically correct . As an ambitious young man with a future Yaralov was torn between his woman and his career . As the Church was chased out of the public square it suffered from remembered abuses of thise in its ' hierarchy although those failures to meet the standard ignore the origin of the standard in question the Church itself . The sellout of a certain medaeval Metropolitan to the Tartars used as an example by Yaralov in telling his betrothed why he will not side with the Church becomes a metaphor for bureaucratic sellout applied by her to Yaralov when he chooses the System over what they both know he knows as the truth.Solzehenetsyn 's account of life within the highest reaches of the Soviet PrisonIndustrial Complex is both a fine story in its ' own right and a warning to us that we can travel the same path if we have already not begun to do so . It is also highly literate filled with allusions to literary and historical figures from the full scope of the Western Canon in which Russia shares and contains very little in the way of anger a remarkable achievement for one who emerged from the bowels of the Gulag . While anger is largely absent satire abounds especially comments by those on the outside about the social origin of others in a supposedly classless society.This long book is well worth the time invested in it as it is a work of rare and tragic beauty.Lloyd A.

"InOne Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich Solzhenitsyn contrived a day for Ivan Denisovich that served to inform readers of the principal aspects of life in a Stalinist Special Prison Camp in Siberia . Along the way he included much about the GULAG system how prisoners came to be there and their prospects of release . That was ambitious for a novel of rather less than 50000 words but Solzhenitsyn 's objectives were fully achieved aided rather than hindered by the limits that he set for both subject matter and time scale . In The First Circle Solzhenitsyn looks again at the life of Section 58 i.e . political prisoners giving himself this time three days just before New Year 1950 to describe a small scientific development and engineering facility on the outskirts of Moscow where political prisoners with appropriate skills were obliged to work long hours on projects such as a scrambler for Stalin 's telephone . Taking just three days and only one such prison again help by containing the scope of the novel . Nevertheless The First Circle is more than five times as long as One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich and has a cast list so large the twoandahalf page listing provided with this translation of most of the character 's names their roles and relationships is a definite asset.Only near the end of the novel is the mystery of the title revealed . A prisoner remarks Mavrino the name of the scientific Special Camp is the best the highest the first circle of hell . It 's almost Paradise . Unfortunately the prisoner who speaks is at that moment being transported back to a labor camp.Besides telling us about Mavrino its inmates and staff and their work Solzhenitsyn paints in much of the background . Thus we spend time with the wife of one of the prisoners as she struggles to subsist in Moscow so as to be near her husband . We also meet the family of one of the free workers at Mavrino who comes and goes on a daily basis with a minor diplomat arrested on the eve of a posting to Paris and with Stalin himself as he works into the night alone in his Kremlin office . As a sort of flashback there is a visit by Eleanor Roosevelt widow of the late President to a Soviet prison shortly after the end of WW2 . Of course what she is shown is contrived to appear humane clean and a relatively happy place for the inmates but is quickly changed back to reality the moment she is gone.As with One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich Solzhenitsyn is telling us of his own experience as a political prisoner incorporating also the stories of some of those he encountered whilst imprisoned . The plot of the novel such as it is serves primarily as a device on which to hang that information . It is the power of the individual stories that gives the novel its strength . ",3
"The First Circle is a deeep look into the hearts of people subject to nearabsolute power . There is a quality of Kafka more than Tolstoy . The power is so distant . But then Solzhenitsyn takes himself and us into the mind of Stalin himself . This is the weakest part of the book . He makes sounds which he imagines to be Stalin 's as having Stalin think of going to Church like Christians everywhere . One never feels inside Stalin . It seems almost a childlike view of the dictator . In many ways it is as onesided though not as propagandistic or overtly phony as the many studies of Hitler . Ten years ! That 's no sentence . Thirty years.One can see the horror of arbitrary power but not look into the soul of its possessor . There is an immense suffering implied by the men driven away on the meat truck the one who says they are leaving Hell and the other who says No ! We are going there now . There is more reality in the suffering of a man who cares only for family . It is tempting to compare this book with Les Miserables by Victor Hugo . I think Hugo 's picture of victimhood is less realistic more Romantic than Solzhenitsyn 's . The First Circle is a book that ought to be read that much I can honestly saythough I feel Solzhenitsyn bit off more than he could chew . It would have taken a Shakespeare to have told the story as powerfully yet with more realism . ",3
"Solzhenitsyn has written for the benefit of the rest of us a work that recreates the madness that was life under Stalin . The First Circle is a story about what happens when the talents of a nation are wasted because those in power happen to be incompetent men that tends to be generally the case except New Zealand . At the heart of it it is a testament to the power of a free market to value resources and direct them to where they are most valued.Well no not really . Solzhenitsyn is not a capitalist at heart and his work does not disparage communism . It is a nonpartisan look at a cross section of society that had to suffer the loss of lives loved ones and youth . It is about their hope in spite of the circumstances surrounding them.Solzhenitsyn 's earlier work _One day in the life of Ivan Denisovich_ made Soviet society realize the genius that was in their midst . The First Circle cements Solzhenitsyn reputation as one of the greats of modern Russian literature . This book deserves to be in your collection.Trust me you will not regret reading this . A definite must read ! ",4
"What does a gulag for the learned elite have in common with an American corporation ? Far too much . I read this book years ago and wish that I could find my copy again . Every engineering education should commence with a reading and discussion of this most engaging book alongside Tracy Kidder 's The Soul of a New Machine . Kidder covers the exterior of the engineering process in an American context of a specific time . Solzhenitsyn though goes to the deep essential tension of creativity commanded to flower on a schedule in the arid fields of rigid institutionalism . ",4
"The best part of this book was the portrait of Stalin . It 's hard to write about historic figures whether it 's Lincoln Hitler or whomever they usally end up sounding wooden or cliched . Yet here the author gets into the head of Stalin . Reading it I felt yes that must be exactly what Stalin thought and felt like.The rest of the book is fine too but Stalin remains the character I remember most . ",4
"What a wonderful story ! Starts as classic pirate romance novel sailor who is ready to get what he wants and maiden who does not want the sailor . Almost like The Taming the Shrew . Even after the maiden is abducted I still thought that it 's all part of the sailors plan for taming his wife to be . That 's when the first twist comes into the story . The story is full of twist and turns and the minute you think you know what will happen next it might go that way or not.It 's a story full of love and passion fear and grief trust and hope . It is wonderfully written nice tempo nice fluidity . Reminds me a lot of Barbara Erskine books or should it be the other way around since Lion Triumphant is written almost 40 years ago and Barbara Erskine first book was published some 30 years ago . But the way how Philippa Carr mixes real historic events into her novels are very enjoyable experience.It is good change from contemporary and modern romance novels . ",3
"A swashbuckling seafaring romance during the time of Elizabeth1 when England was renowmed for her Navy and taking on the might of the Spanish Armada.This is a very dated romance now and the hero Jake Pennylon left a lot to be desired in his actions and justifications for his pursuit of women and sons . No way could this be considered a PC romance . His long suffering wife Catherine certainly was n't a pushover by any means and managed to hold her own.Still it was an engaging romance with some excellent historical detail and a list of characters that were interesting .

"Some things about this book were predictable which almost made me not want to waste my time reading it . But I enjoyed the history that was interlaced in the story and the main character is very relatable . There 's really not much else to say about this book . It was n't amazing but it was good . ",2
"Love Ms. Carr 's style of writing 1st person so you really feel as if you are living the story . Romance danger mystery this book has it all ! A must read ! ! ",4
"This is a beautifully written historical romantic thriller . It challenged me in more ways than one but kept me turning the page struck not only by the violence of the Spanish Inquisition and the reversion to Protestant rule under the reign of Queen Elizabeth in England but also main character Catherine 's life during this period . It is a gripping novel that delves into the barbarism of people who murder rape and seek revenge under the guise of religious doctrine and superiority . Following Cat through her tumultuous life finding love losing love and not appreciating love until it was taken from her was a difficult process at times . It seemed that no one person could go through the trials and tribulations of life and continue to fight while remaining sane.The most disturbing part personally was the total dislike of the two leading men in Cat 's life Don Felipe and Jake . I hated them both . Then I loved them both which was unsettling . Both men were so dissimilar in their mannerisms upbringing and religious beliefs yet they mirrored each other in their quests for revenge and ability to justify their evil immoral actions through misguided reasoning . Both were excessively arrogant and believed they alone made the rules and decisions in their lives and dictated events around them to achieve their desires . They also both loved a woman who fought back vehemently and despite her hatred of the men she grew to admire and love those parts of each of them that were redeeming and worthy.Ms . Carr 's knowledge of the violent history of this period creates a feeling of almost two novels in one providing an amazing setting to explore the strength of women during a time when women had no authority and very little worth past producing heirs . An exciting tale that had me glued to the page and eager to read the next book in the series . ",3
"I have read this book many times and have enjoyed it each time . I first did not realize it was a series of Daughters of England I now enjoy reading them all . ",4
"I never realized that Phillippa Carr is Virginia Holt who is also not her real name . This is a bit darker storyline than Holt 's gothic . There is violence and manipulations and acceptances . This is n't a typical romance and you 're really not sure who to be rooting for . But overall I was engrossed and engaged and enjoyed it ! ",4

While traveling abroad in Turkey he was introduced to the Chief of the Secret Police . Colonel Haki told him about finding a body and Charles asked to visit the mortuary for the experience . Intrigued by the history of this Dimitrios Charles decided to follow the trail and act as a detective . Dimitrios escaped Smyrna in August 1922 and went to Sofia Belgrade Paris Lyons and other places . The police knew of him but ca n't prove anything . Then his body was found in Istanbul . Charles Latimer traveled to these places to try to learn something . One unforeseen fact is that it is dangerous for a literary person to get involved with criminals they do n't appreciate the interest shown in them !

But he continued his journey without any fear.Chapter IX tells how a spy gained the friendship and confidence of a clerk in a government ministry . The clerk needed the money after he lost at a rigged card game . Peters told how he smuggled heroin to France in a coffin but that could n't be done regularly .

Their last meeting ends with rough justice . Charles Latimer decides to set his next mystery in an English country village . The ending seems unreal forced by the need for Latimer 's survival . ",3
"John Pearson the author of The Life of Ian Fleming and the Authorised Biography of James Bond recommends that this is one of the classic Spy Stories which Ian Fleming strove to emulate . Read it and realise why . ",3
"My husband wanted this book and to my knowledge has yet to read it . The story sounds rather grim but I '' probably read it before he gets around to it . ",4
"The novel which inspired Graham Greene John le Carre Alfred Hitchcock and Ian Fleming who described it as It opens with Charles Latimer a mystery writer navely accepting an assignment to discover who ended the life of criminal mastermind Dimitrios . In doing so he gets drawn further and further into the murky corrupt world of the deceased a man for whom war offered so many opportunities he had no objection to helping start one . As our narrator crisscrosses World War II Europe reconstructing the life and death of the great manipulator he quickly learns that everyone who knew Dimitrios is even less savoury than was the man himself . By now he knows he 's been set up and that he 'll be lucky to escape with his life but what he does n't know is why.This is a taut gripping espionage thriller with lashings of intrigue paranoia and doubledealing which has held up well this past seventy years . Containing certain parallels to today 's uncertain times I feel this novel may well be set for a revival.A definite recommend for people who enjoy character driven tension . ",4
"A tip from Tory Education spokesman Michael Gove led me to sample Eric Ambler . He is one of the finest and most neglected thriller writers of the 20th Century.The Mask of Dimitrios is perhaps his best known book . It is a spare stylish thriller that takes place amongst the seedy bars and crepuscular hotels amidst the dangers of 1930s Europe . The protagonist Charles Latimer is not a professional spy . He is a former university lecturer now a writer of detective stories who is interested in the world around him . He is also something of a connoisseur of food and drink ensuring he always has an appropriate aperitif before dinner.He comes across the mysterious Dimitrios when Mr Haki procures a dossier about the infamous criminal whose body has been dredged out of the Bosphorous . Thinking he can garner material for a new novel Latimer retraces Dimitrios 's steps across Europe and uncovers several former acquaintances . Things are not what they seem and Latimer realises through unravelling several false facades and shifting alliances that loyalties are not always reliable and alliegances can shift easily.The Mask of Dimitrios is not simply a corkscrew plot thriller . Nested in the spare and elegant prose style are a wealth of pithy reflections and ruminations on life from the political events of the era such as 1922 GrecoTurkish war to an analysis of drug addiction to memorable pen portraits and images of the 1930s the gas lit theatres and dingy hotels Ambler 's prose does far more than tell a story.The Mask of Dimitrios offers a window into the anxieties and mores of the 1930s better than most histories of the period . An era when As Ambler puts it late on in the book 'The logic of Michaelangelo 's David Beethoven 's Quartets and Einstein 's physics had been replaced by that of the Stock Exchange Year Book and Hitler 's Mein Kampf ' .

"This book was made into an excellent film starring Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre . Never to my knowledge available on DVD but still out on VHS on Amazon .

"The story and characters of a story set in ancient Atlantis is spell binding . I bought a copyfrom a second hand store in the 1970s and felt inspired one dark night to find it in my over stuffedbook cases to reread it . It was damaged and so I ordered another copy from Amazon Books . I am amazed at how fresh the story is and how it seems prophetic about ourcurrent global struggles compounded by environmental issues of pollution and global warming fraught of latewith many tidal waves earth quakes and volcanic eruptions etc that disrupt international travel . The book seemsprophetic too about the corrupt practices people are becoming aware of in religious scientific political and media institutions . The book shows the materialism and weakness of modern society where welfare hand outs or a lush sensual materialistic way of life keep the populace subserviant but also weak with no sense of ethics or morals in their conduct towards others . Taylor Caldwell dreamed of this story with herself as principal character an Atlantean princessempress in a life time lived in Atlantis . During this lifetimeAtlantis supposedly sank into the sea due to misuse of nuclear power that had fallen into the wrong hands of young vigorous but dangerous powers.It is an enthralling read and seems as if channelled and prophetic . ",4
"I found this book at an exchange in a local library and am a big fan of Taylor Caldwell . The writing is extraordinary especially for a 12 year old . I find it too parallel to our present circumstances . ",4
"I have always loved Taylor Caldwell 's novels and love the subject of Atlantis but this book was n't her best . They say she wrote it when she was thirteen years old ! It was an okay book . ",2
"A 12 year old girl Taylor Caldwell prodigy wrote this but did n't publish it until many years later . I had read several of her books so was prepared somewhat for the experience . I recommend it for any age and gender . ",4
"I was amazed by a great novel especially through the eyes of the novelist as a precocious 12 year old . That in itself blew my mind . And it is a great read ! ",4
"This book was quite a threat to read indeed . It is detailed description of a different culture that disappeared eons ago . It is said that this was the first book of Taylor Caldwell who was once one of the most famous writers . ",4
"Taylor Caldwell wrote this book when she was only 12 years old even though it did n't get published until she was much older with the help of Jess Stern I was so impressed with her ability to tap into that Era Although many people think it never was I do ! ",4
"I first read this book when it came out in the 70 's . I have a first edition hardback copy still signed by the author . It is a remarkable book . Whether she wrote it when she was ten or a hundred does not negate the fact that Taylor Caldwell was a marvelous story teller . ",4
"I have read most of Taylor Caldwell 's books and this is by far my favorite . Probably because the subject of Atlantis is so intriguing . I just finished my third read of this book and it felt fresh and new again . I never reread fiction but this book does n't feel like fiction . What it feels like is an autobiography and as it turns out that 's what Caldwell believes it was.Written when Caldwell was only 12 years old the Romance of Atlantis was sent by Caldwell 's father to a publisher friend who said that there was no way a young girl could have written the story and claimed Caldwell must have plagiarized it . Many years after becoming a famous writer Taylor Caldwell learned of past life regression through a journalist Jess Stern and soon with his help published this remarkable book.What is amazing about this story is how real everything seems . I see ancient Rome Greece and our own modern society reflected in Caldwell 's story . The main character the empress Salustra is so real that at times she 's heroic and at others she 's a product of her society as much as her degenerate people . When Signar the Emperor from the far north frozen country comes to take over her kingdom Salustra falls in love with him even while knowing she must have his put to death . We see the Vikings in Signar 's people a lusty strong people as wild as their environment yet still able to produce an atomsplitting bomb.I highly recommend this book . It 's one of the most intriguing thoughtprovoking suspense books I 've every read.When I Dream ",4

"Over the years I 've come across references to Anthony Powell 's 12volume series Dance to the Music of Time as being a towering achievement of 20th century English literature and I remember vaguely that some decades ago I checked out one of Powell 's volumes from my local library the time then being when I went to the library and found books and a quiet reading atmosphere as opposed to today with the library being heavily digitized and the ambient sound filled with patrons seeking help on how to navigate the electronic devices that comprise the collection . At the time I had just finished reading and adoring C. P. Snow 's Strangers and Brothers series and I was hoping to find in Powell an author akin to Snow one who could absorb me into the lives of people from a society I only superficially knew and then largely through its literature . I was sorely disappointed in Powell his prose was longwinded complex and the plot moved slowly if at all . I put the Powell book down and after these many years I think due to its ready availability on Kindle and its near giveaway price I thought I would give Dance to the Music of Time another try this time starting with the very first volume of the series A Question of Upbringing.Set in the period from the end of WWI to about 1921 and within what I imagine to be upper very upper class English society A Question of Upbringing introduces four students in a English public school whom Powell will follow through the remaining 11 volumes of Dance to the Music of Time until after WWII . It did n't take me long to realize the extent to which I had changed and how what I long ago thought was at least boring I now viewed as fundamental to good and enjoyable literature the extended and complex sentences beautiful in themselves the leisurely pace of the narrative with much of what happens being the subtle changes in the observations of the characters and the universality on a human level of what they experience even though the exterior circumstances of their lives reflect a world that passed at least a lifetime ago . I credit Powell 's genius with giving meaning to what happens to his characters . Immediately after finishing this first volume I enthusiastically started reading book 2 A Buyer 's Market . ",4
"I have read many of the twelve volumes a couple of times and each reading leads to new treasures . Powell is a superb writer with a compassionate but realistic view of upper class England in the years from 1930 to 1960 . You can start with any of the 12 but it is better to start with the first book . Prepare yourself for a literary feast ! ",4
"With A QUESTION OF UPBRINGING published in 1950 the English novelist Anthony Powell began his ambitious 12volume series A Dance to the Music of Time which follows the narrator and his social circle from the early 1920s until the early 1970s . As the novel opens an old man named Nicholas Jenkins reflects on Poussin 's famous painting where four figures representing the Seasons dance to a lyre played by the personification of Time . A human life muses Jenkins is such a dance with partners disappearing only to reappear at later times.Encouraged by this metaphor Jenkins ' reminisces begin with his school days in the early 1920s . Studying at an unnamed institution probably Eton Jenkins introduces his roommates Stringham a melancholy soul from an aristocratic family and Templer scion of a businessman and a bit of a rebel . These three young men form a tight band and laugh at Widmerpool a buffonish boy always on the margins of their society but ambitious and intent on making a name for himself . The plot of A QUESTION OF UPBRINGING is rather simple as Jenkins proceeds from school life to a summer abroad to learn French and then into the university . Though the paths of all four main characters diverge after school Jenkins meets up with his peers again at odd moments until a rather dramatic separation marks the close of this first volume of the series.A Dance to the Music of Time has been compared to Proust 's In Search of Lost Time in its firstperson narration and ambitious scope . To a degree the comparison is fair . However Jenkins is nowhere near as introspective as Proust 's narrator . Although Jenkins often talks about how the events he recounts impacted his life sometimes he seems to almost step out of the frame and dispassionately depict the events happening around him . Also Powell adds a great deal of humour although much of this is deadpan to an almost Edward Gorey degree and will not appeal to everyone.In fact the aristocratic concerns of this series will put off a lot of readers . Powell has sometimes been attacked as a snob simply because he finds the lives of England 's upper class to be a worthwhile setting for his series . But the decline of this world is an epic process and has within it a great deal of dramatic potential even if we find these people 's privilege odious . This decidedly middle class American reader enjoyed A QUESTION OF UPBRINGING very much . Jenkins ' look back at his formative years has spurred me to consider my own . The novel is quite realistic in many ways indeed in later volumes there 's an element of roman a clef about it . Powell 's characters are universal archetypes we all know a Widmerpool or a Templer but they are never twodimensional and have a convincing dimension to them.All twelve volumes of A Dance to the Music of Time have been reissued by University of Chicago Press in four handsome trade paperbacks . If you think you 're going to go the distance that 's a better investment than older editions of the individual volumes . ",4
"I had never heard of Powell or his twelve book symphony until a discussion about the mechanics of the Alexandria Digital Library brought him to light . Although the recommender had n't listed Powell as something I 'd care for one of the participants in the discussion who knew of First Impressions thought it might be something up my alley . Based on this first book I 'm afraid that the machine wins.A Question of Upbringing introduces you to the main characters of Powell 's magnum opus the narrator Jenkins who one never really gets a handle on because he spends more time describing the others than ever going on about himself Templar the womanizer and layabout Stringham privileged and haughty and Widmerpool the odd man out with drive and ambition but no class . One meets them at boarding school and follows them through college in this first volume but what happens is never as important as what one thinks is happening . As a narrator Jenkins is obtuse to the point of frustration never quite describing the situation but using plenty of words to not do so . Every time I thought something was going to get interesting the novel would shift to some other scene.The blurb writers compare Powell to Proust but I can safely say that A Question of Upbringing is much more interesting than The Remembrance of Things Past . A comic masterpiece though ? Not in this first volume . The book I have has the next two in the sequence and I will likely go ahead and give them a try but based on the first soiree I must dance to some other fiddler . ",1
"If a bit over written at times this first book in the series is a fine introduction to one of the great architects of sentences ",2
"This is the first volume of Powell 's highly regarded Dance to the Music of Time sequence of books and it offers a smooth if rather unexciting read . The story evolves around a young Englishman in the 1920s his school friends their families and some of their adventures growing into adulthood in the post World War I era . The book offers a wonderful sense of time and place although the main character utilizes a strange detached narrator voice . He 's present as events unfold but he 's never really a part of what 's happening . He just observes reports and discusses the various people involved.The characters in the book are interesting in an English drawing room kind of way reflecting the strong class struggle that dominated society back then . The novel is well written and offers an excellent portrait of a specific time and place although readers of modern thrillers and suspense novels might find Powell 's work a bit slow . ",2
"A man reflects upon his encounters with schoolmates friends and family as he grows up enters university and starts to find his way in upper class 1920 's English society offering detailed thoughtfully drawn descriptions in a kind of measured somewhat nostalgic voice . I found this welldrawn glimpse into another time and another society quite fascinating but if you do n't like books where nothing much happens but observations of life this may not be your cup of tea.This is the first book of a somewhat intimidating 12book series but I thought it stood pretty well on its own and was worth reading even if I do n't end up finishing the entire series .

"Once more I 'll observe that the pricing this time from the rapacious University of Chicago Press why ARE they taxexempt ? is exploitive and unjustifiable . You can buy the four movements = 12 books for roughly $ 68 . Or you can buy the 12 volumes in eform for roughly $ 75 . Yet the ebook costs nothing to ship nothing to print no dead trees no ink and in fact U Chicago had no editorial costs . No wonder reading books is dying out . It 's the ripoff publishers and wretched copyright laws that will have killed it.The series is wonderful I 've read it through 3 times as well as individual novels at various times . It 's a masterpiece . ",4

"After all the outstanding reviews of Powell 's work I decided to see what I was missing . Well after reading the first installment of this 12volume epic I 'm left with two questions1 . How did this man ever get this first novelette published ? 2 . Why should anyone care to read beyond it ? I encountered perhaps one quiet moment of smiling in this dull novel where nothing ever happens and a lot of the worldweariness of the English upper classes where the smallest details of home dress speech gesture action not that there 's much of it are judged wanting by one or another of the characters . It 's always about class and prejudice . Sigh . The author provides no reason for the reader to care about any of his characters.The introductory paragraphs promise great things with a solemn nod to the muses and occasional epic tags occur with libations and ritual movements but it 's all a tidy bag of nothing . Rather like Graham Greene but without the nastiness . Henry James does this kind of thing well while engaging the interest and emotions of his reader Powell could have learned from him.The next time I want to read about the English upper classes leading lives of silent desperation cloaked in ennui I shall turn to P.G . Wodehouse God bless him . ",1
"I 'm currently working my way through Proust and I 'd heard Powell 's multipart novel compared . I found it excellent but only superficially like Proust.The story such as it is involves Jenkins relating four specific times in his youth . Many characters are introduced and the focus is on them everything we learn about Jenkins is pretty much in relation to those around him unlike Proust . Despite the relative lack of action I found it almost compulsively readable the literary equivalent of popcorn but much more filling . Powell 's dry wit and talent for characterization makes him a delight to read . ",4
"This is the first volume in Powell 's mammoth work running to 12 volumes . These were published between 1951 and 1975.This first volume starts with Jenkins at his public school and his his two friends Stringham and Templer . It runs for four chapters the school a holiday visits to his friends homes and then Jenkins first year at Oxford.Characters introduced here leave clues to how their lives may develop and intertwine with each other in later volumes.It is a reflection of the boys life a chronicle of their time set in the early 1920sthe attitudes the behaviour and of Britain 's place in the world.Its great to read it just flows along very detailed but it is never boring it just draws you in to a world that no longer exits and never did for the majority of people.This was brilliant and I am excited about reading the following volumes .

"A Question of Upbringing by Anthony PowellAnthony Powell 's A Question of Upbringing is the first part of his mammoth twelve novel epic A Dance to the Music of Time . He writes with wit humour and not a little sarcasm describing a quintessential Englishness that perhaps was never representative of the society and has arguably disappeared . He wrote this first volume in 1951 and though the book starts with a London scene from that era the majority of the book deals with the characters ' school and university experiences and recalls a time passed.The main character is Jenkins . I will follow the author 's lead and use surnames only for males surnames plus titles for married older or otherwise unavailable women and Christian names for eligible women whether they be of a certain class or prone to wear flowery dresses while standing next to post boxes in the street . As his friend Stringham discovered even some of the surname plus title women at times can prove highly eligible.The book 's form is both simple and intriguing . It is so effective we almost miss the ingenuity of its construction . There are just four chapters each in excess of fifty pages and each focused on one particular episode . We have school a social gathering a holiday in France and college undergraduate life . Powell 's writing has such a lightness of touch that we forget how intensely we are invited to analyse the circumstances of each chapter and how penetratingly we discover the characters ' lives . There is considerable innuendo much gossip and usually piles of money along with social status and influence wrapped up in every household.The quintessence of their Englishness like characters in the novels of Evelyn Waugh arises out of their apparent inability to question or perhaps even notice their privilege . It 's a state they inhabit without either reflection or gratitude so much taken for granted that it lies beyond doubt its achievement apparently assumed not expected . School means one of the better public schools . Going up to university assumes Oxbridge as a right though Powell tinges this with the perennial blight of the English upper classes intellectual paucity by having several of his keen entrants decide not to complete a degree . One assumes that many of the others will take thirds before assuming their company chairs or ministerial portfolios . The army figures large in family histories always at officer class of course and so does the City where one can always become something . Even Americans however can be described as having millionaire pedigree on both sides an economic status that presumably compensates for what is otherwise a palpable lack of breeding . When family members do not assume expected and assumed heights they are referred to in hushed tones the words black sheep perhaps not politically or at least socially correct even then.But if this really was a quintessence of Englishness it was a pretty rare ingredient . Maybe one or two per cent of the population went to the right school . Only about five or six per cent attended higher education of any sort let alone a university one went up to . Neither Sandhurst nor corporate board rooms were populated by the masses . They still are n't ! And so this was a quintessence of separateness of rarefied heights in an extended class system and certainly by the 1950s some of these peaks had been scaled by other aspirants using new climbing techniques eschewed by the incumbents of years.And so A Question of Upbringing reveals its duality . It 's a tale that celebrates a time lost a nostalgic peek into a remembered adolescence where a hand placed apparently carelessly and always momentarily upon that of a member of the opposite sex remained a daring highpoint of teenage years.Nostalgia is always tinged with loss however . Early in the book Powell describes the school thus Siltedup residues of the years smouldered interruptedly and not without melancholy in the maroon brickwork of these medieval closes beyond the cobbles and archways of which in a more northerly direction memory also brooded no less enigmatic and inconsolable among watermeadows and avenues of trees the sombre demands of the past becoming at times almost suffocating in their insistence.And how about this for a presumption of affluence It was a rather gloomy doublefronted faade in a small street near Berkeley Square the pillars of the entrance flanked on either side with hollow cones for the linkmen to extinguish their torches . And we notice we are in a different age when Powell has his lads pick up two girls off the street to joyride in a new Vauxhall . Without a suggestion of tongueincheek or indeed relish he can write that The girls could not have made more noise if they had been having their throats cut.When I first read Anthony Powell I could not get past my ingrained hatred of this class and its powerassuming wealthinheriting inhabitants . It was a country that was not mine . I come to it now a little wiser and a little richer myself richer in experience at least and now I can appreciate the irony that my previous naivety ignored . I now look forward with some relish to the next eleven episodes . A Dance to the Music of Time is certainly a masterpiece to be revisited . ",3
"Typically this short novel shall we say novella is included as the first part of Anthony Powell 's twelve part project A Dance to the Music of Time . Putting aside any financial arguments about why one may be better off purchasing the latter project instead of this lone excerpt from it A Question of Upbringing is nonetheless an engaging worthwhile read that bodes well for the remainder of this epic work.The story focuses on a year in the life of three students in an English boarding school capturing several incidents that characterize the lifestyle and that provide enough random details to fill in the back stories and probably futures of these characters . One of the boys is a libertine in the making displaying both a love of women and a disregard for authority . One is a young man with family connections adventurous yet cautious and bound to make a name for himself in the hectic London scene . The third boy the narrator is the most timid and unsure of himself constantly evaluating the actions of his peers and trying to find his own place in the world.Powell 's writing is excellent displaying an extremely dry wit that brings much humor to a rather staid and tradition bound culture . The short novel is essentially a series of set pieces an incident at school a weekend in France a tea party involving eccentric school intellectuals that paint a complex and involved picture with the broadest of brush strokes . It is truly a masterful work that seems effortless and encourages the reader to immediately jump into the second book to discover where Powell is headed after this strong beginning . ",3
"Marcel Proust 's great novel sequenceIN SEARCH OF LOST TIME was published in England in twelve volumes between 1922 and 1930 . English novelist Anthony Powell pronounced Pole was surely thinking of Proust three decades later when he began his own twelvenovel sequence under the rather cumbersome titleA DANCE TO THE MUSIC OF TIME . It is taken from a painting by Poussin details of which are reproduced rather unattractively on the covers of the fourvolume Chicago edition . No doubt I shall be reviewing each threenovel set as I finish it but I thought I would begin with the question of what the first novel in such a sequence looks like and whether it can stand on its own . My quick answers it is quite fun and considerably less pretentious than the overall title but also very episodic you need to look beyond the book itself to get much sense of a through line.Proust opened with the narrator bemusedly lying in bed recalling his childhood . Powell begins his with a group of workmen repairing a street in an English winter fog . The setting though unnamed is clearly the surroundings of Eton College England 's premier boarding school . We are introduced by the narrator Nick Jenkins to his two roommates the cynical aristocrat Stringham and the wealthy Templer already proving himself something of a ladies ' man . Emerging out of the fog on a training run is an older boy called Widmerpool whose awkward intensity has made him the butt of college jokes . The first of the four long chapters may seem strange to American readers but it is familiar to me from my own days at a similar school and though apparently consisting of quite minor events such as a practical joke played on the boys ' housemaster it nonetheless sets up the interplay of characters quite beautifully here and throughout with Powell 's wonderfully sly humor.Subsequent chapters show Jenkins on an extended stay with Stringham 's family spending a summer in France where he once again bumps into Widmerpool and in his first year at presumably Oxford an episode that comes to a head in an almostdisastrous outing in a fast car driven by Peter Templer . The most significant character in this chapter though is an older professor called Sillery who makes a habit of inviting young men to tea and injecting himself into their lives with the ultimate motive of building a network of contacts in the outer world that will serve as the web for this avuncular spider . So he finds Stringham a job with an influential politician and he leaves Oxford . The book ends with the three friends moving out along divergent paths and several other characters introduced in the last pages who will presumably become important later . It is a curiously unsatisfying end for a standalone novel but an auspicious beginning for a series . ",3

Also mentioned is a slightly odd character named Widmerpool who Jenkins meets up again later in the book when he visits France to improve his language skills .

"This is deft clever deeply felt but reserved English prose kind of a combination of Evelyn Waugh Marcel Proust and some very expensive very dry champagne . It will make you tipsy even if Nick Jenkins the firstperson narrator and your host at this party which follows its characters from the 1920s to the 1950s sometimes drives you mad with his cool basilisk reticence . I know he 's there to tell you about other people but when he casually drops the news that he got married with barely a glimpse of the wife and no hint of the courtship it gets somewhat irksome . But not enough to subtract a star . Take this book on its own terms . It 's a masterpiece . ",4
"My first and continuing impression is that Anthony Powell wants to be Charles Dickens with barely a modicum of either his talent or his insight . Not the best use of one 's reading time . ",1
"A Question of Upbringing is snapshot memories of the narrator 's life in the transition between public private school and university in the years immediately after World War 1 . The people and their world are privileged moneyed but not necessarily wealthy . The memories are in moreorless chronological order related from the perspective of an older and wiser man . It 's superficially straightforward and plotless in the conventional sense . The tone is faintly satirical not broadly comic . The approach is observational almost like a collection of essays on character and situation . In that sense it stands alone but you know going in that it 's the first volume in a long series . This wo n't be to everyone 's taste . I enjoyed it though I reserve judgment on whether it 's part of a great work of literature.The Kindle version was mostly free of typos one missing space between two words was all I noticed.Note to the reviewer complaining about price If it costs too much to suit you do n't buy it . If enough people do n't buy it then the publisher will get the message . The Kindle version of this book costs about half what the corporate giants are charging for comparable incopyright backlist literary fiction and roughly 80 percent of current mass market paperback prices which accounts for the difference in cost of printing distribution and storage . I find the price quite reasonable . ",3
"I found the book dated and mannered compared with how young people think and behave now in senior years of high school and at university . Its prose is also somewhat convoluted and stiff compared with current literary styles . I doubt if I will bother to read any of the subsequent volumes . ",2

Years later Jani 's beloved Eleanor becomes ensnared by a strange man and Jani is determined to save her . This brings Mister Adam Gascoyne back into her life.This was the first novel by Brent that I read and it remains my favorite . ",4
"I love Madeleine Brent and wish there were more books out there like hers ! This one is especially good . While a little slow to start the story picks up and I could not put it down . I was so sad when it ended . Jani and her friends are such loveable characters and the novel really made me feel good as cliched as that is . There were times when I laughed and cried while reading this book . Highly recommended ! ",4
"Before I discovered Madeleine Brent 's books my favorite author was Victoria Holt and I absolutely always said that I could n't imagine another author ever topping her in my favorite 's list but I have to admit that I was wrong wrong wrong ! ! And I am hardly ever wrong just ask my husband ! ! Anyway you ca n't go wrong with any of the Madeleine Brent books and my two favorites and it is very very very difficult to pick a favoriteare Merlins Keep and The Golden Urchin the Golden Urchin being my favorite book of all time ! ! How I wish Hollywood would wake up and make some movies based on these books by Madeleine Brent I know they would become beloved classics ! ! Read all of the Madeleine Brent books and you wo n't find better prices than those on Amazon.com Happy reading ! ! ! ",4
"Though written in 1977 its values are timeless and its historical value intriguing . I agree this should be a movie . As for the writing at no time does the author intrude . Jani is a well written strong and believable charactor which one instantly likes then falls in love with . Very well written and entertaining to read . Madaleine Brent is a jewel to have shared this story with us her readers . ",4
"I read this book when it first came out . That has been some time ago . However I find that this author stands the test of time . What is so surprising is that after all these years I find that Brent was really a man . The characters are well developed the suspense is great and the story holds your interest till the end . I have since reread quite a few of the author 's other books and find I am enjoying them as much as I did then . If you want a good entertaining read with interesting locals and some surprising endings pick up a Madeleine Brent . ",4
"I always enjoy Madeleine Brent books and this one was missing for several years . I 'm glad to have it back . ",4

"I own all nine of Brent 's books and each time I reread them they captivate me all over again . New readers may not know that Madeleine Brent is a pen name for Peter O'Donnell who was better known for his Modesty Blaise series . All the great traits of the characters in the Brent books both men and women can be found in Modesty Blaise series as well definitely worth collecting . On a side note Kirkby 's Changeling was the British title for Stranger at Wildings . ",4

"It has n't been very long since I 've become aware of Allingham and Marsh 's contributions to the mystery writing era in which Christie and Sayers dominated . After slogging through the first several Allingham entries decided to switch off for a while and tackle some more later . For me her stories have been so encumbered with difficult and now obscure British dialect as to wear one out trying to mine the story . This first Marsh entry was thus quite refreshing with its entirely more readable aspect and simplicity of language . While it is somewhat redundant in its oftrepeated English country house weekend format it is an encouraging start to the writer 's series . I sincerely look forward to succeeding editions . ",3
"James Saxon gives a royal sendoff to Ngaio Marsh 's very first Roderick Alleyn mystery originally published in 1934 . Russian spy rings could be dealt with then as somehow detached from anything Soviet no sound Englishman need be suspected of association with the rather laughable group and well to say more would be revealing too much . Nothing else about the book is dated since it is in the classic mold as it was being modified by Agatha Christie Dorothy Sayers and Margery Allingham among the fine British practitioners . I enjoyed reading this fledgling Marsh effort written ten years previous to my first acquaintanceship with Alleyn which occurred during WW2 through Colour Scheme . I should think this archetypal country house mystery would be required listening for any Marsh fan since in addition to meeting Alleyn for the first time we also get to meet the quite young and naive reporter Bathgate portrayed as few reporters have been in mystery stories . New Marsh readers will not be quite as enthralled as the villain of the piece is not entirely unpredictable and the Russian element is more a diversion than an intrinsic element of the plot . Still and all it is an admirable first effort which is as I have pointed out given a first rate performance by the expert James Saxon . It should be an enjoyable few hours for any classic mystery fan although not up to the standard Marsh later set for her works . ",4
"You would think that people in murder mysteries would n't go on weekend trips to remote mansions and definitely would n't play murder games . So guess what happens in A Man Lay Dead the first of Ngaio Marsh 's Inspector Alleyn mysteries while it feels a bit bythenumbers at times it 's a genuine brainscrambler.To spice up a weekend party at Sir Hubert Handesley's 's estate the guests decide to play Murder which goes wrong when they stumble across Charles Rankin 's corpse with an antique dagger stuck in his back . There are a few motives floating around but the missing Russian butler seems to be the guilty party just because he 's suspiciously missing.But Inspector Alleyn from Scotland Yard is n't quite sure about the murder especially since the motive seems rather flimsy . And he must unravel a tangle of alibis motives illicit romance ! The knife ! and odd clues before he can discover who is responsible for Rankin 's murderCountry estate + a pair of attractive young things + hearty squire + suspiciousquirky foreigner + a handful of other random people + a Scotland Yard Inspector = one generic murder mystery.This was not only Ngaio Marsh 's first mystery novel but her first novel period and as a result A May Lay Dead is rather paintbynumbers as a mystery story . However you can see the flickerings of unpolished greatness under the surface and the second half of the novel is where she really starts to blossom both in prose and in plot.Marsh unspools the plot at a pleasantly leisurely pace filling it with sunlit English countrysides and comfortable old manorhouses . And she sprinkles said plot with a fair number of red herrings quirky humor Ethel the Intelligent and Florence the Farsighted and halfformed motives although not as many as you 'd expect . And while her prose is pleasant but unexceptional in the first half of the book Marsh hits her stride about halfway through Impossible to see behind the shadowy face of the detective into the pigeonholes of his brain.Alleyn himself is a rather likable and promising detective we do n't know much about him personally just yet but he 's depicted as a cultured high society man who has somehow ended up in Scotland Yard . Marsh makes him intelligent and clever but does n't make him TOO perfect when confronted by a surly kid with evidence he does n't know what to do.A Man Lay Dead is a solid if slightly generic start to Ngaio Marsh 's classic series and by the way she improves in the second half you know that better is yet to come . ",3
"This is not my favorite Ngaio Marsh novel . One of the things I like about her later books is where they break from the more classic chamber mystery form . This her first book while still being very readable and enjoyable is much more in the line of the tried and true formula . The characters are as always interesting and welldrawn the red herrings are sufficiently misleading . Solid all the way around . ",3
"It always takes time for me to settle into the pace and style of these old mysteries from a time and place I 've never experienced but this story is worth it . It 's very wellplotted and anyone can identify with the different characters . ",4
"A preposterous tale that can only be excused by the fact that it was the author 's apprentice work obviously to Sayers and Christie . The situation is wholly generic murder done under cover of ` The Murder Game ' and all the suspects have castiron alibis . The murderer 's is clever rather than convincing but even this is undone by the complete absence of clues . It is not however the central murder that damns the novel but the sheer badness of the extraneous elements . The facetiousness is embarrassing Alleyn and Bathgate are at the nadir of their ingenuousness giggling coyly like a pair of schoolgirls while the passages with grubby brats are irritating in the extreme . The final straw is the intrusive and irrelevant Russian element which badly dates the tale indeed the preposterous bratsvotorture scenes are reminiscent of Walling and Wallace at their worst . The previous owner showed his disappointment by scribbling Cyrillics in the margins . ",1
"An classic English style murder mystery from before WW II . If you like classic British style murder mysteries from the classic era this one is for you.An Inspector Roderick Alleyn murder mystery . Sir Hubert Handesley is having a country estate party with a twist a murder mystery . Invitees include Mr. Bathgate Charles Rankine etc . The difference is that a real murder is committed . That certainly was not planned.The author is very good at her craft and keeps the plot turning and twisting to keep one from guessing who is the killer . Well done classic murder mystery . ",3
"Great plot great characters and beautifully crafted . The author is an historic landmark of the genre and she is st her best here . Love it for its period detail . ",3
"This is a book which is part of one of my favorite series . Ngaio Marsh is an excellent writer . I always enjoy her books . ",4
"This is a pretty good book up till the time he explains how the murder was done then it just defies belief . I wish she had just left the Russian gang thing out completely as it just sounded too melodramatic for a mystery novel like this . I 've read many of her books that are a lot better in every way . ",2
"In 1934 Ngaio Marsh gave us the first of a series which for lovers of the English cozy deserves to be known better than I think it is . This the first in the series gets things off to a great start . True this may not be Ms. Marsh 's best crafted pure mystery she got better with time and the plot here is so much a paradigm for the genre that it is at least now a cliche . But Roderick Alleyn arrives on the scene as an interesting and believable centerpiece with enough of an enigma about him to make us want to know more . I have read a half dozen others before coming to this one but wish I had started here . ",3
"Until now I had never read anything by New Zealander Ngaio Marsh . Shall I ever again ? Well yes especially when I feel in the mood for a ` classic cozy ' and I mean that quite literally . This is Detective Inspector Roderick Alleyn 's first mystery . He has to be the most shrewdly charismatic of all the sleuths created during the Golden Era of mystery . In its most classic sense A man lay dead takes place at an English country house . A party of five guests arrives for a weekend at Frantock Sir Hubert Handesley 's residence . Quite the tycoon Handesley distinguishes himself in party planning and antique weapon collecting . One of his guests Charles Rankin brings with him not only his dull journalist cousin but also a very old and priceless dagger of Mongolian origin . Upon perusal by Sir Handesley and the other guests during cocktails the weapon appears to have a bloody past it is believed to have been savagely used by some secret Russian organizations during the time of the Bolshevik revolts . Needless to say after seeing the specimen Sir Hubert 's mouth waters his Russian butler disappears mysteriously his only Russian guest a Dr. Tokareff starts acting weirdly then ever and Charles Rankin is stabbed in the back with the weapon during ` The Murder Game ' which was supposed to be the entertainment of the weekend . Thus the innocently planned party becomes quite eerie its guests more tense than ever even though they all appear to have castiron alibis.This first novel is somewhat general at times but two thirds into it I could n't put it down . I found ingenious the way Marsh would not give away whodunit right up to the last two or three pages in the book . Alleyn keeps everyone on their toes during a constant guessing game and even though at times he may appear disconcerting to everyone else involved including the reader he is very much in control of his ideas suave as ever . I did find however that the Russian element in the story was pushed a bit too much . Even though the dagger does have a bloody past it has really nothing to do in the end with the actual solving of the crime . In bringing on a complicated background of Russian espionage Marsh confuses the reader with so many new characters and plot twists . In the end it all goes back to the beginning literally to Frantock where Alleyn in a most dramatic display of his powers of persuasion taunts the murderer into self discovery . I very much enjoyed reading the descriptions of the English country settings and the way the game is planned perhaps I shall try it for my next party ? No dagger mind you and I look forward to more Inspector Alleyn mysteries where due to Marsh 's love of the theater everything has quite a dramatic development . ",2
"A Man Lay Dead is the first appearance of Inspector Roderick Alleyn . Alleyn is Ngaio Marsh 's handsome creation who went on to star in over 30 novels and short stories . Marsh has often been overlooked in the mystery genre but in my opinion she is one of the very best . Her wit characters and tight storytelling make all of her books very enjoyable to read . The murder may seem to be a little difficult to solve yourself but as you get used to Marsh 's tools and style you quickly catch on and start to think like her hero . I highly recommend this book as a great introduction to Marsh 's wonderful world . ",3
"This is a classic country house murder mystery and the first of the Alleyn mysteries . I really think Marsh is at her best writing this sort of English countryside whodunit . A weekend house party leads to a body with a ceremonial dagger thrust in its back . In the house there are blossoming relationships some mysterious Russians a secret brotherhood and Alleyn is called in to investigate . The result is a fastmoving and satisfying mystery . ",3
"This is a great introduction to a delightful series set in the classic English manor house.. Marsh takes her reader along not letting one know the how and who under the last few pages . It 's the beginning of a wonderful friendship between Alleyn and journalist Nigel Bathgate . The series definitely improves over time but I always like to begin at the beginning . Personally I prefer Marsh to Christie maybe because I 'm a procedurals fan . Whatever your preference there are interesting characters effective red herrings the classic reveal all of which result in a very satisfying read . ",3
"Our library mystery book discussion group read this first mystery by Ngaio Marsh this month . Consensus was it has many fun elements authentic 1930 's setting plot of murder mystery game in English country home fairly likable detective masterful writing and somewhat dramatic plot . However we agreed it could have been improved with fewer stock characters the detective and other characters fleshed out more a more believable plot less theatrical toning down of Russian sideplot more clues for reader to ascertain who the villain was and more suspects.It 's evident that Marsh is talented as a wordsmiththis book does n't have a firstbook feel with awkward prose . We were glad we read the book and some of us want to sample some of Marsh 's later books to see how her talent developed . I love the authentic 1930 's setting from someone who lived during the time and can accurately portray the feel of the times which is why I love reading these Golden Age mystery authors such as Marsh Sayers Allingham and Christie .

"When a house party is interrupted by a murder Alleyn must wade through a revolutionary plot as well as a web of secrets to find the killer.Good enough police procedural although Alleyn is not your typical bythebook policeman . Not exceptionally involving but it kept me reading . Marsh irritated me with the hidinghisfindings routine though . ",2
"Marsh is still feeling her way a bit here and Alleyn her Scotland Yard inspector hero is n't quite who he 'll be a few books further on but it 's where we first meet him and it 's well worth a read . My biggest objection is the price . This is an digital version of a novel from the 1930s and it 's about the cost of a paperbackI 'm separated by circumstances from my complete set of secondhand Marsh paperbacks and I 'm probably going to end up buying replacements I can read on my phone at scandalously high prices . How much is the Marsh estate actually getting anyway ? Very little if anything I expect . I suppose that this is better than the books being unavailable but if they were $ 1.99 each in this form I 'd have bought the lot already . ",2
"3.5 stars Taking place at an English country estate during a house party weekend Ngaio Marsh 's first Roderick Alleyn mystery written in 1934 forecasts the later success of her successful thirtytwo book Alleyn series . Invited to the home of Sir Hubert Handesley where they will participate in a murder game the houseguests know that one of them will be chosen to be the murderer and that she will select and murder one of the other guests . In this case however when the gong sounds and the lights come on they discover that one of the guests has actually been murdered.Written in the tradition of Agatha Christie Dorothy Sayers and Margery Allingham this closed room mystery draws Inspector Alleyn of Scotland Yard into the case . A character who at this point has yet to achieve the unique characteristics which eventually makes him such a popular detective Alleyn interviews the guests and staff and surprisingly draws guest Nigel Bathgate the cousin of the victim into the investigation of the murder . As Alleyn and Bathgate investigate subplots involving an antique Oriental dagger an anarchist Russian secret society a grisly murder in London and the romantic attachments of the victim unfold.No more realistic than other mysteries of the period this one like those follows a formula with surprising discoveries which strain credulity at the same time that the author is tempting the reader to solve the case . Much is made of the floor plan of the estate and the alibis of the guests but ultimately the solution depends not on logic but on information which the author does not give her readers until the conclusion making logical deduction impossible here . Still the novel is fun to read as a period piece a mystery which calls to mind a longlost way of life with all its superficial pleasures and amusements . n Mary WhippleVintage Murder Roderick Alleyn MysteriesNight at the Vulcan Roderick Alleyn MysteriesBlack As He 's Painted Roderick Alleyn MysteriesFalse Scent Roderick Alleyn Mysteries ",3
"A Man Lay Dead is a tight wellwritten and fun little murder mystery . It is n't a very long book and reads quite fast so it serves its purpose well as a quick and cozy getaway to 1930s England and the crime that seemed to run rampant there in the world of detective fiction.The setup is deliciously wicked . A group of people gather at an old country estate for a game of Murder . Someone is secretly selected to play the murderer and then at some point during the weekend has to pick a person to kill not for real of course . Well someone takes the playacting a little too far and a man does indeed end up laying dead.The characters are delightful representations of 1930 's stock murder suspects and they are all welldrawn by the author . The protagonist DetectiveInspector Alleyn is quite an allbusiness kind of man but his character develops remarkably and naturally well as the story unfolds . Some of the tedious things he does earlyon make sense by book 's end.This was a very enjoyable mystery . I only deduct one star due to its rather superfluous nature it 's not a classic of the genre or anything however in my opinion it does everything a detective story should and in the best possible way.Short sweet and highly entertaining .

"When beginning to read a series that unfolds various episodes in the lives of a group of characters even in mystery series where the individual books are standalone works one often wants to begin at the beginning . A MAN LAY DEAD however is an instance of a book not only at the beginning of a series but at the beginning of its author 's career when Marsh was still experimenting with the craft of writing mysteries as well as working out how best to deploy her chief investigative character Alleyn of Scotland Yard . His rank varies over the course of the series but here he 's already rather distinguished and in his very late thirties or early forties . He 's a character who will not age much over the next fifty years of his career.The basic plot of A MAN LAY DEAD is fairly simple Nigel Bathgate a young reporter is accompanying his welloff cousin Charles Rankin to a country house party wherein the main entertainment of the weekend is to be a Murder Game which of course features a real corpse sooner rather than later . Since the local police force is fairly small and has a few people off sick they promptly turn the case over to the Yard and Alleyn takes over the investigation . The fact that some of the chief suspects ordinarily live in London does n't seem to be a factor . Bathgate is essentially the viewpoint character throughout without use of Alleyn 's point of view as in later books and Marsh introduces some rather strained bits of business at times to ensure that Bathgate can be an eyewitness to parts of the investigation that realistically he should never have been allowed to see let alone participate in . Alleyn is an interesting but rather remote figure in this story.The country house setting has about a dozen servants looking after a household whose official residents total two as far as I can tell Sir Hubert a fanatical weapons collector with a hobby of giving parties and his niece Angela who is Bathgate 's romantic interest . She 's a demonic driver and looks very good indeed compared to the female guests who are both hangerson of Nigel 's cousin in one way or another . The other members of the house party generally give an impression of being stuffy andor affected at first sight while few of the servants have many scenes . Marsh in later years tended to develop supporting players more than she does here.Considered as a puzzle the story has at least one weakness which is that Alleyn has information about the motives of some of the suspects that is n't given to the reader . However since the evidence about how the crime was committed and of the characters ' movements is provided the reader has enough to work with to attempt a solution.Considered in terms of portraying a police investigation I do n't think Marsh has been particularly realistic . On the one hand Alleyn effectively puts the entire house party under house arrest by instructing them not to leave the house until the inquest not for example just making themselves appropriately available while on the other hand the house is n't properly locked down and one of the servants manages to get away completely and does n't seem to face any consequences for having fled the scene once he is located . Alleyn messes around with forensic work rather than letting his fingerprint expert just do his job and ask for everyone 's fingerprints but on the other hand abets some illegal search and seizure at another point . As well as the standard reenactment of the crimeconfront the murderer scene Alleyn involves civilians unnecessarily in another bit of hunting with live bait that goes badly wrong.In terms of human interest that turns this into a story rather than a simple puzzle and supplies red herrings where necessary I had thought Marsh 's second book ENTER A MURDERER was overly melodramatic in spots . I spoke without having completed this book which combines some fairly believable personal relationships with incidents that try the reader 's credulity . One amazing subplot amazing as a descriptive not a compliment is that the murder weapon is a symbolic weapon of a Russian secret society . The reason I 'm not being complimentary about this is that the society is introduced without really being made to earn its way it could 've been really interesting and colourful but fell flat . Marsh does n't seem to have put much effort into consistently working out what she did use with it it 's a Russian society but uses Mongolian weaponry and the first member of the society we learn about is Polish without any sense of how all those elements are supposed to fit together . This kind of undeveloped gimmick is n't at all typical of what I 've read of Marsh 's later work so if a reader began with this book the reader might get a very inaccurate impression of her typical style.Drivein totals Three love affairs at least one including the viewpoint character . One secret society with ceremonial sacred weapons and some torture . One kidnapping episode . Some rather prejudiced attitudes among the characters mostly antiforeign sentiment with one noticeable ethnic slur . ",1
"Ngaio Marsh created many lovely cozies after her debut but I think that A Man Lay Dead remains my favorite . In this book Marsh establishes Inspector Roderick Alleyn as the irreverent clever fellow we 've grown to love . Those new to Ngaio Marsh should definitely start at the beginning . ",4
"which does n't mean that you should n't read it since even Marsh 's books that are n't quite up to the mark are still very good reads . I found the method of murder to be a little too clever for something that was not necessarily premeditated . Everything else though characters motives weapon etc . are in perfect order . AND you get to meet the muchfeatured minor character Nigel Bathgate the gentlemanjournalist who comes closest to what one might call Inpector Alleyn 's Watson . ",3
"Ngaio Marsh 's A MAN LAY DEAD is the first of the Chief Inspector Roderick Allyen of Scotland Yard series.A house party game of murder turns deadly when a guest is stabbed within a short space of time . It 's up to Roderick Alleyn to sort out all the conflicting and false stories to uncover a clever killer.A perfect beginning for this long running series with subtle false clues to confuse the most astute of readers.Ms . Marsh is one of the best from the British Golden Age of detective fiction.Nash Black author of CARDS OF DEATH ",4
"The first of the Inspector Alleyn and the first Ngaio Marsh I 've read . I read it quickly in a morning but did n't enjoy it less because of that . It 's a classic country house murder mystery where some not very nice person gets done in in a spectacular manner . As usual there are a host of suspects all with motives any one of whom could have done it except each have an alibi . The good Inspector painstakingly works his way through the clues and red herrings the snatches of overheard conversation and the dropped buttons until he reaches a conclusion . The clues and red herrings may not be quite as cunning and inexplicable as they are in Christie and Conan Doyle but they 're clever nonetheless and designed to catch the reader out . Recommended for anyone who enjoys a good whodunnit where the culprit is eventually revealed at the end . ",2
"This 1934 entry pretty much has it all a large English manorial estate a weekend party where The Murder Game is being played out a Russian doctor whose specialty is ancient weapons and of course a murder.Inspector Roderick Alleyn is called in when a man who was the recent recipient of an ancient and valuable Russian knife is murdered . And his good friend was a weapons collector who wanted the knife at all costs.But another weekend guest a quirky Russian doctor desires the knife for yet another reason it 's morally property of an ancient and dangerous Russian Secret Society.There was also some hankypanky going on between the victim and another man 's wife the jealous husband and the victim 's mistress both being guests at the scene and they thus become murder suspects.In any event said knife becomes an effective murder weapon as this elite group plays The Murder Game . A young investigative reporter who 's there as a guest also becomes a suspect but ends up helping Inspector Alleyn to solve the crime . There is also a subplot concerning the covert and nefarious activities of the Russian Secret Society in England.This is a good one VERY cozy ! My highest recommendation . ",4
"I have read most of Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers so it was inevitable that I would eventually find Ngaio Marsh . I am saddened that she is almost unknown here in Australia as her writing really extend the murder mystery genre . This debut is thoroughly enjoyable as a typical English manor murder mystery although her subsequent novels really show off her skills . ",3
"The first Alleyn mystery is very much in the country house upper crust murder mode . Marsh had n't quite figured out how to present Alleyn he 's a bit more highstrung here than in her more accomplished period and he relies more on amateurs than he does later and her later murder solutions were generally less absurd . Her prose style is by and large as crisp and competent as it is throughout her career.The Kindle version by Felony & Mayhem is mostly clean of typos I noticed one incorrect word and 34 places where no space followed a comma or period nothing worth reporting .

"Alistair Maclean weaves as good a tale of intruige and unexpected plot twists as anyone and he did it better in the 1970s than anyone . When compared with today 's similar action adventures by authors such as Tom Clancy however Maclean 's come up only slightly second best.Even with that being the case Maclean 's books and WHERE EAGLES DARE in particular are worth a look.In this book set during WWII not long before DDay an American general who is one of the chief planners for DDay is shot down over Germany . British intelligence decides to send in a topflight group of agents to try to rescue him from an impregnable castle fortress in Bavaria . The leader of the group Smith is accompanied by 5 other British agents and an American Shaffer not to mention a woman who is part of the endeavor known only to Smith.Smith is completely British including his humor while Shaffer is completely American including American humor.This is a fast read at only a little over 200 pp . quite a bit shorter than the 400+ pages of Clancy 's works . The dialogue is good the plot development and its twists and turns are great . There is not a lot of depth of character development just enough to carry the story but the action and suspense make up for it.As you probably know this book was made into a movie starring Richard Burton as Smith and Clint Eastwood as Shaffer . The movie is quite faithful to the book including dialogue directly from the novel . They kill fewer people in the novel than in the book Shaffer and Smith both come across as being more gentle still coldblooded but gentle than in the movie.Keep an eye out for Shaffer 's falling for Heidi something that does n't happen in the movie.It 's a good fun summer read.4 stars.Be careful out there ! Alan Holyoak ",3
"I seldom read the same book more than once but the books by MacLean are an exception from that rule . You can have them in the shelf for years and every now and when you dust your books you will start to look at one of them . Before you know it you have finished of three or four of them . I ca n't recall any other author having the same effect on me . Today I just finished The dark crusader after reading When eight bells toll I think I 've read those two books three times by now . The MacLean books I rank to be among his very best are Where Eagles Dare Fear is the key Ice station Zebra H.M.S . Ulysses Circus The last frontier The golden rendevouz The satan bug The guns of Navarone and Puppet on a chain . The following books are also worth while reading Force 10 from Navarone When Eight bells toll Night without end South by Java Head Bear Island The dark crusader . Alistair MacLean mixes suspense spy stories heroism plots characters of good and evil and humour like noone else . Thinking about it its obvious why I keep coming back for the same books over and over again . If you buy and read them you will agree with me . If you already have them you know what I mean . Let me end this review by saying Thank you Alistair MacLean for having written so many good books ! Finally if you like Alistair MacLean you will also like the books of Desmond Bagley the earlier books by Jack Higgins and Dennis Lehane . ",4
"Like Louis L'Amour and other masters of the potboiler Alistair MacLean styled himself as more of a yarnspinner than a writer . Actually he could write some awfully fine prose but even some of his most celebrated work have more than their share of clunky narrative . Take his 1967 novel Where Eagles Dare.During World War II an Allied commando team drops down in southern Germany to infiltrate the Schloss Adler a mountain fortress occupied by the Gestapo where an American presumed to know all about the upcoming DDay landings is being held . It soon becomes clear that some members of the team are less committed to the mission 's success than others . Even the team 's leader Major Smith is telling less than he knows.The mountain fortress itself as well as the funicular that provides its only point of access make for a sensationally dramatic backdrop as MacLean follows his characters furtively grappling and clinging and dodging and sweating every German guard who lingers too long in one spot for an extra puff of his cigarette.There are some great action moments too wellrendered by MacLean 's taut prose The knuckles of the hands gleamed like burnished ivory . And then suddenly there were no hands there just the suspension arm and the empty wire and a long fading scream in the night.But the book is also burdened with some of the worst dialogue in the MacLean canon especially involving the comedy stylings of Smith 's American ally Lt. Schaffer The Alpine Corps ! If I had known this I 'd never have come alongWhy did n't someone tell Ma Schaffer 's nearest and dearest ! MacLean 's attempts to make Schaffer a slangy Montanan fall painfully flat and the humor between him and Smith is never better than strained.There 's also some business with a Nazi helicopter . Yes the Germans did develop a helicopter in 1936 but it was a prototype and never mass produced . If MacLean had to go and put an anachronistic toy in his Nazi fortress at least he could have done something interesting with it.The 1968 movie seems to skim away the dross of MacLean 's book and delivers slambang entertainment with Richard Burton as Smith and Clint Eastwood as Schaffer keeping the repartee to a believable minimum . It 's interesting to see how MacLean treats human life more respectfully in the novel at one point Smith even endangers the mission by going off to rescue an unconscious Nazi guard too close to a growing fire . The higher kill count of the movie with Schaffer blazing away with his machine pistol is more mindlessly entertaining but it 's nice to see MacLean saves the truly nasty fates in the book for those who deserve them.The best parts of the book are featured to better effect in the movie Watching Burton as Smith play his hand with the Nazi commanders is to see one of the 20th century 's finest actors at his hammy best . But you have to credit MacLean for devising such a scene and as it appears in the novel much as it did on the script you ca n't say Where Eagles Dare the novel fails at being entertaining . If only it were a touch more plausible . ",2

Failing that to kill him.This is a joint AmericanBritish spook operation so those doing the dirty work find out that all is not as it seems . ",3
"This is such a good book . It 's exciting and funny in places . The fight atop the cable car and the car chase with a bus through the mountains can be read over and over again without ever getting old . ",4
"Alistair Maclean 's novel 'Where Eagles Dare ' is a great adventure story that takes the reader back to the desperate days of World War Two . The story centers around a crack British commando team infiltrating a Bavarian stronghold to rescue a highranking American officer . From start to finish this is riviting fiction . Maclean 's protagonists are the kind of characters that make you want to cheer and the plot contains enough twists to keep you guessing right up to the end . The movie version of this novel which stars Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood is one of the the most faithful film interpretations of a book ever made . Read the book and then see the film ! ",4
"Alistair MacLean proves himself to be an accomplished storyteller despite not being in possession of classic literary writing skills as demostrated in his taut adventure thriller Where Eagles Dare . Noteworthy was how closely the movie based on the book stuck to the plot.A group of commandos who had recently been chained to desks is mobilized by the British high command for a clandestine mission behind enemy lines . A group of eight lead by British espionage officer Major Smith has been airlifted to the Bavarian Alps to rescue American Lt. General Carnaby who is being held by the Nazis . The general is imprisoned in Gestapo headquarters in Schloss Alder the castle of the eagle atop Weissspitze Germany 's second highest peak . The general is purported to be an important orchestrator of Operation Overlord the Allied invasion of Europe.Major Smith an agent previously assigned to Italy is aided by American Lt. Schaeffer a young but wily OSS officer . Together with the rest of the group they must penetrate the formidable defenses of the heavily garrisoned Schloss Adler before the general can be made to talk.In a plot replete with surprises and startling twists MacLean leads his heroes through a veritable minefield of problems the least of which being a harrowing cable car ride to the top of the wind buffeted mountain . While the dialogue between characters is at time ridiculously contrived the fast exciting pace of the novel more than makes up for that . MacLean proves to be a master of the double and triple cross in this engaging book . ",4
"Growing up in the UK my reading material was an eclectic mixture of Enid Blyton children 's adventure novels Ian Fleming and John Gardner espionage tales and Alistair MacLean wartime escapades . It was in this environment that my love for well crafted tales of suspense adventure and espionage was fostered and nowhere is this more apparent than in the MacLean thriller WHERE EAGLES DARE.Second among my favorite MacLean works my alltime favorite being WHEN EIGHT BELLS TOLL the storyline for WHERE EAGLES DARE was faithfully recreated for the 1960s movie with Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood not surprising really since MacLean adapted his own novel for the screen.A group of British Commando 's along with an American Ranger parachute behind the German lines in World War 2 . Their stated mission the rescue of an American General who has been captured by the Nazi 's and taken to a mountaintop fortress.Of course like many I had seen the movie several times before finally settling down to read the book but settle down I did and what a ride MacLean treated us to . The action is well described with whiteknuckle realism and MacLean 's complex and intricate plotting is both well structured and compelling . For those unfamiliar with either the book or the novel there is also a nice twist that to this day has me marveling at its pure ingenuity.Okay so the dialogue may not be the best but I for one do not read MacLean novels for their dialogue.For adventure novels MacLean is the master as much as Agatha Christie is the Queen of the whodunnit . I wish that the entire series of novels would be reprinted for a new generation to enjoy . ",4
"Not a page turns without a member of the British commando unit making a quip . The humor is so dense that even one of the characters remarks on it ! And the military behavior of the British commando unit specifically the behavior of the unit 's leader Major Smith is so laughable that it boggles the mind . In one passage Major Smith played by Richard Burton in the movie remembers that he tied up a German radio operator in a room just above the room he has set on fire to cause a diversion . Well even with Alpenkorps soldiers just yards away searching for the British and the whole fate of the mission in great jeopardy Major Smith even to the consternation of Lieutenant Schaffer played by Clint Eastwood in the movie runs back up to the room where the tied up German radio operator is and unties him ! It would seem that the World War II Alistair MacLean wants to impart to us was a kinder gentler World War II where chivalry still ruled military conduct IT DID NOT ON EITHER SIDE OF THE CONFLICT ! Another thing that annoyed me was the disrespectful way in which Lieutenant Schaffer refers to Major Smith his superior throughout the novel 'boss ' . However the character of Lieutenant Schaffer can be excused for such insubordination since MacLean unintentionally gives us a character devoid of any intellectual rigor to put it kindly . Particularly squeamish is Lieutenant Schaffer 's imbecilic spur of the moment decision to marry and spend the rest of his life with a British agent he 's just met in Germany ! The screenplay for the movie also written by Alistair MacLean is by contrast a far superior product . MacLean excises from the movie all of the ludicrous quips and the equally ludicrous military blunders committed by the British commandos that are found in the novel.Avoid the novel at all costs ! Watch the movie instead ! ",0
"Where Eagles Dare may be author Alistair Maclean 's best known novel thanks to the exciting movie version starring Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood . The novel in this case is even better than the movie.Eight Allied agents parachute into the snowy Bavarian Alps deep inside Nazi Germany . Their hastilyorganized mission is to rescue a captured American general from a practically inaccessible castle before he can be tortured into revealing the plans for the DDay invasion . Their nearly suicidal mission is made infinitely more complicated by the quick discovery that someone on the team is a traitor.What follows is a succession of hairraising white knuckle adventures as the team struggles to enter the castle rescue the general identify the traitor or traitors and escape Germany . Where Eagles Dare is Maclean in his prime providing a challenging and suspenseful plot whose last twists come in the very last scene . The dialogue is brisk sardonic and occasionally humorous . The team leader Major Smith and his deputy Lieutenant Schaffer are the archtypal buddy team easily outdoing their counterparts in the movie.This novel lacks some of the emotional punch found in Maclean 's earlier novels such as The Guns of Navarone but excels in MacLean 's clear mastery of his craft as a entertaining storyteller . The descriptions of Bavaria add the necessary sense of place to each scene wellsupported by a tautly drawn supporting cast of characters.This book is highly recommended to fans of Alistair Maclean and to those looking for a very enjoyable reading experience .

"WHERE EAGLES DARE was my first Alistair MacLean novel and while it certainly kept me engaged and even suffering shell shock by the last page it was when the smoke cleared That I was left a little disappointed.Action thrillers by their nature stretch credulity and count on the reader being willing to suspend disbelief but at a certain point WHERE EAGLES DARE went over the top and became simply too unbelievable . I place the tipping point in Chapter Seven when Smith and Schaffer descend from the minstrels ' gallery into the den of Nazis and Nazibankrolled double agents . Smith bluffs his way through a delicate and tense situation masterfully if even too easily and from that scene forward Smith takes on the traits of an invulnerable superspy bigger than James Bond Derek Flint and Matt Helm.The suspense was considerably dampened in the latter half of the book compared to the opening six chapters . Earlier scenes leave readers wondering whether Smith can really pull off this impossible mission especially with unidentified and murderous traitors in his midst . The scene in Zum Wilden Hirsch and the train depot come to mind as gripping ones where I really thought Smith would be caught especially after he blunders by implying he 's related to Heinrich Himmler and later leaving behind a warm radio set . Compare those episodes to the scene near the end aboard the Alpine post bus that with Smith at the wheel becomes a rolling fortress . I groaned when the pursuing Nazi Tiger tank 's 88millimeter shell crashes through the back of the bus flies the full length of the interior and out again above the winsdhield and Smith and Co. hardly break a sweat over it.The book was clearly written with the film adaptation in mind . The entire novel unfolds like a movie with an emphasis on vivid action sequences and MacLean certainly knows how to create suspense with words with the iconic cable car sequences testimonies to that . Mary and Heidi are wholly irrelevant in the book and I suspect were included only to meet Hollywood 's demand for a leading lady and a romantic interest . The Nazi baddies such as Kramer Weissner and especially the randy Brauchtisch had all the menace of Colonel Klink and Sergeant Schultz . In fact the German soldiers as a whole were straight off the set of Stalag 13 less interested in winning the war than in haunting weinstubes warbling Lili Marlene while getting blitzed on Steinmechers of dark beer.I have not yet seen the film adaptation but I picture it in circa 1968 terms as a bigscreen production of what could have been Christopher George 's invincible RAT PATROL in The Schloss Adler Raid . Striking similarities to that shortlived series include an American and an English soldier teaming up to topple like tenpins bumbling Nazis and leaving explosions in the receding background as they make another skinoftheirteeth escape . I do n't know whether MacLean was drawing inspiration from primetime television though I strongly suspect he saw GOLDFINGER as the closing scene aboard the plane bore unmistakable parallels to the conclusion of that James Bond classic .

"Another excellent thriller written by Alistair MacLean in his prime . The film with Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood closely follows the novel.MacLean 's tale of Allied commandos breaking into a heavily guarded German fortress is often dazzling and always suspensful . It 's only after the reader has finished the last page and closed the novel that he may wonder about the plot . There are to be diplomatic a few holes in it . Not as awful as the plot in The Dirty Dozen but It 's doubtful this operation would have ever been approved by the Allied high command . But the author makes you believe in it while turning the pages.The writing is superb . While a little suspension of belief is needed Eagles is an excellent World War II tale . ",4
"Alistair MacLean is one of my favorite novelists and this is my favorite novel by him . The setting is World War II and a team of seven or is it eight doubleagents are sent to rescue a kidnapped actor who is assumed to know something from a castle in a mountain accessible by cable cars.This novel keeps you guessing at the edge of your seats . The ending is the best one I 've read by MacLean I find his endings to be a weakness as a whole . ",4
"Classic book interesting to read the differences between the book and film . Great story characters and just plain entertaining . But could not get the music score out of my head . ",2
"This author makes his living on plot twists . Just when you think you have it figured out there is a new course . The story is a good one and very well told . The author has his historical facts correct which is important in this type of book . I would like more to a story the editors in the 70 's must have been paid per word they cut as it seams most books of that era are a little on the short side . That aside this is a good yarn with a good story . ",3
"Alistair MacLean has written an entertaining behindthelines World War II adventure . LikeCasablanca it only works with some willing suspension of disbelief by the reader . It 's a small effort with the large return of an enjoyable read.Lieutenant Schaffer is the only American assigned to a British commando team led by suspiciouslynamed Major Smith . The eightman team parachutes into the Bavarian Alps to rescue a captured American general . The general apparently knows far too much about the plans for DDay and they have to get to him before the Gestapo can begin interrogation . It soon becomes clear that somebody on the team is a German agent.The story is enjoyable with a number of plot twists and surprises . Of course real German soldiers were n't as blankly unimaginative as many of the ones in the book . Some of the helpful coincidences are a little hard to swallow too . But the holes are n't so big we ca n't drive around them . The story works well enough . Themoviemade from it is pretty good too . ",3
"I enjoyed this book very much . Having already seen the film made it even better . Highly recommend this book . ",4
"This is a classic MacLean novel . Lots of action lots of plot twists set in WW2 with a girl named Mary.If you have seen the Clint Eastwood movie prepare to be surprised . The movie was a terrible translation of the book even though MacLean was the scriptwriter . Or maybe the book was an improved version of the movie I 'm not sure which was written first . In particular the Eastwood character is a coldblooded killer while in the book he 's a happygolucky guy with a big heart and a crush on a helpful barmaid.As with all MacLean books the point of view character lies to the reader about his real motivation and hides crucial information until the very end of the novel . This makes the novel something like a cross between an action book and a mystery.The classic image from the novel is the fight that takes place on the top of a cable car in the icy Alpine winter . But the big surprise is that by the end this British commando team has been inserted deep into Germany and yet they do n't kill a single German soldier in the entire book . Very different than some other action novels including some by MacLean where the body count piles up quickly and the protagonist has a very itchy trigger finger . ",3
"This is simply one of those ca n't put down thrill a minute will he wo n't he ? classic books that have us reliving WWII . Bullets wizz double agents crawl out of every hole and you are never quite sure of the outcome . Brilliant I am so glad Maclean wrote thirty odd thrillers I wo n't be running out for a while ! ",3
"Surprisingly hard to come by nowadays this novel was written in parallel with the fantastic film in a similar way to '2001 A Space Odyssey ' but with much more action . It makes an interesting companionpiece there are some subtle differences in detail and tone and whilst the book has plenty of action the destruction is n't quite so overthetop . Best of all you can pour over the famouslytortuous plot at your leisure without having to pause and write down a little flowchart showing who is pretending to be who . On the downside you do n't get the fantastic soundtrack or Clint Eastwood 's mildlypeeved grimaces as bullets zing around his head . Although he will forever be associated with 'Eagles ' MacLean was more of a cold war thriller writer than a warthriller writer and the book is an odd cross between straightforward WW2 action and a John Le Carreesque spy thriller meaning that the book is doubly dated but still great fun . ",3
"One of Maclean 's finest novels . Full action thrills and wry humour . ",4
"this is one of the best thrillers i have ever read . i started it after dinner and did n't stop til i finished it at 5 AM . my brother did the same thing . as good as the best of the ludlums The bourne identity the gemini contenders . the movie was very well done too with richard burton and clint eastwood .

"I expected to enjoy this book since I love military and suspense novels . However I soon realized that this book was n't what I thought it was . The dialogue is truly awful unless you enjoy comic book tough guy language . The heroes use flippant humor when they are in grave danger not just once or twice but continuously . I almost stopped reading it was so annoying . And a Brit writing American slang dialogue for one of the characters is almost as bad as an American writing British dialogue . It just does n't sound quite right.The plot although certainly creative just was n't believable . Maybe this type of novel is n't meant to be believable but it sure is something I like to see . And there were n't just one or two instances of these improbable plot elements . They just kept coming and coming . For example an escape from their German captors based on a brilliant improvisation . In another instance an impersonation of a double agent based on unbelievable luck gullibility of the SS not generally known for this and a few convenient added elements that seemed just too good to be true.Now I should say that this type of book might appeal to a teenage boy . I think I would have enjoyed it at that age . But as an adult I would look for better writing and a more realistic plot . If you are looking for something in the way of a 20th century military novel I would recommend the following authors Jack Higgins James Webb Tom Clancy Patrick Robinson Herman Wouk James Jones Larry Bond Dale Brown and Anton Myrer . _The Eagle has Landed_ _The Caine Mutiny_ and _The Hunt for Red October_ are among the best of these novels that I have read . Jack Higgin 's books are probably most similar to MacLean 's with exciting plots and heroic characters but with more realism and better dialogue . ",1
"I read all of MacLean 's books when I was a kid and although Where Eagles Dare is not his best it is easily his most exciting . I remember being up at 4 a.m. unable to stop reading.Unusually this is MacLean 's only book in which he wrote a screenplay first then based the novel on his script that 's why the film seems such a faithful adaptation . As a result the book is shorter and leaner then many of his novels and it definitely works for the story . The suspense never stops building the action sequences especially atop the cable car are some of the best he 's ever written and the characters have a very entertaining repartee between them particularly Smith and Shaffer . Where Eagles Dare also features some of MacLean 's sexiest female heroes not always present in his books.The Guns of Navarone had a greater scope and deeper character development H.M.S . Ulysses was harrowing gritty and deeply humanistic Ice Station Zebra had a plot with more twists and doublecrosses but Where Eagles Dare was MacLean 's alltime actionsuspense fest . ",3
"I read this as a thirteen year old boy and enjoyed it . A reread twenty years later gave me a different perspective . MacLeans dialogue between his characters is comic book variety at best . There are also a few glaring errors that I am surprised that his editor did not pick up on two of note Shaffer supposedly from Montana is credited with a MidWest accent ? ? Montana is far west not 'mid ' west . Secondly Nazi helicopters ? This is just plain sloppy . MacLean should have known much better.This one belongs on the bookshelf of a teenage boy . For a better read of MacLeans better works I reccomend HMS Ulysess and Bear Island . The characters are far more credible and provide a better story by far . A poor effort by Mr MacLean . ",1
"It 's inexcusable for this book to be as bad as it is when the author is clearly a very able writer and capable of coming up with some lovely twists . It showed promise but some of the things MacLean asks the reader to accept just stretch credulity too far . The plot has holes the good guys are crammed full of contrived and tedious bravado and most infuriating of all to me the hero continually endangers his soldiers and his mission through an utterly inexplicable refusal to kill nazis . I really hope the movie is better I 've yet to see it.It 's not without its charms . You may be able to enjoy the way the hero cleverly improvises his way out of one predicament after another if you can make yourself forget that many of the predicaments are directly caused by his own astonishingly stupid decisions . You may find it possible to get your money 's worth out of this book by just numbing yourself to the silliness picturing Clint Eastwood and accepting it as a quickread thriller that will make I promise absolutely no demands on your intelligence . But I could n't do it . Not recommended . ",1
"I had read most of Alistair Maclean 's books back in the 70 's and 80 's . Glad I decided to get the rest of his works . I had forgotten how much I enjoyed his thrillers ",4
"This is an unusual setting for Alistair MacLean to use . I have n't read a good western for many years but this is a very good story . The many twists and turns in this story keep one riveted to the book from the very first line to the last . As with most Alistair MacLean books I would only recommend this one if you have the time to read it because you wo n't be able to put it down once you start it . ",4
"The other reviewer is right . This is a Western thriller written by an Englishman . It 's a very exciting story . The gunfight as the train winds through the mountains can not be put down . Read the book before watching the movie . ",4
"Love this movie with Charles Bronson and Jill Ireland . So reading the book . Not bad . Still like Louis Lamour and Zane Grey better . This is a good story . ",1
"Master action adventure author Alistair Maclean goes away from his usual World War II setting using a 1870 's Western theme for his 1974 novel Breakheart Pass . While not written with the intricate plots or character descriptions of his earlier work the book contains enough misdirection and intrigue to keep you guessing . Maclean 's writing style is which he displays an erudite command of the English language gives us small bits and pieces of information slowly advancing the plot.Breakheart Pass involves a perilous winter railroad journey through the Nevada territory in the midst of a frightful blizzard . Aboard the train are Nevada governor Fairchild and his niece Marica along with U.S. cavalry colonel Claremont and two carloads of troops . Joining them are U.S. marshal Pearce and the governor 's aide and Pearce 's old army buddy Major O'Brien . Pearce a venerable lawman and Indian agent was transporting dangerous murderer and gunman John Deakin . Their destination was the remote Fort Humboldt nestled deep in the Nevada mountains . Their trip was a mercy mission as a cholera outbreak in the fort had decimated the troops who were in need of relief and medical supplies . Dr. Molyneaux a tropical disease expert was accompanying the aforementioned entourage.As the journey continues we slowly learn that all is not what it seems . Maclean has meticulously obliterated the lines defining exactly who were the good guys and who were the bad . A nefarious plot had been hatched and the train passengers were mostly all integral parts of it . As the story winds down the cunning deviousness nature of the plan is finally revealed . ",3
"Breakheart Pass is famed British storyteller Alistair Maclean 's crack at writing a western novel . The plot concerns mysterious events on a train traveling to a remote U.S. Army Fort in what may be the Nevada Territory of the mid1870 's . The riders on the train a collection of soldiers politicians and lawmen are not who they seem nor is the situation at the distant Fort as advertised . Fans of Maclean will recognize the usual plots twists thrillpacked finale and sardonic dialogue.Maclean is less successful capturing an authentic tone of the frontier West . His characters are a foreigner 's view of American stereotypes . The leading character the mysterious Deakin is not a particularly interesting protagonist and the plot is unusually contrived and difficult to follow for Maclean . The story still manages to be interesting and even entertaining but it is not up to Maclean 's best efforts.This book is recommended to fans of Alistair Maclean . ",2
"When I first read this I was surprised because Alistair Maclean had written Cold War thrillers novels located in Arctic locales some contemporary novels and some with World War II in the background . This was his first and only venture into the American West.Always thought this was one of his best novels . After this the author sadly began to decline . But in Breakheart Pass his prose was still sharp and so was his plot . As in many of his novels his characters are on a ship or outpost or in this case a train and a number of mysterious deaths occur . Clearly one or more of the characters are killers.This was made into a movie with Charles Bronson and it 's one of the few MacLean books that Hollywood did n't screw up . That 's probably because MacLean wrote the script and it adheres closely to the novel . A very suspensful tale . In his prime there was no one better than MacLean . The novel is a fitting tribute to the old West . ",4
"Alistair Maclean 's only western . Written with excellent pace suspense created very early and as always with the old master the right combination of romance tension and action all on a train headed for a lonely fort somewhere in the wild west . ",4
"By the mid 70 's Alistair Maclean had begun to decline in his writing lapsing into overblown plots and cliche 'd characterisation . Perhaps he realised this since this book is quite a change from his usual naval fiction and Cold War thrillers . 'Breakheart Pass ' is set in the American West of 1873 and the action centres on a train carrying relief troops for Fort Humboldt which has been affected by a cholera outbreak . On board are a varied bunch of Cavalry soldiers and officers a US Marshall Governor Fairchild of Nevada and his niece and various individuals a doctor a preacher taking up residence at Humboldt . Also on board is John Deakin a criminal being transported to Humboldt to be executed for murder arson and robbery . Of course since Deakin has a sardonic sense of humour contempt for authority figures and cracks lots of chivalrous oneliners at the Governor 's niece you know in an instant that he 's the Maclean hero and that there 's much more to him than first thought . Predictably mysterious things begin to happen aboard the train unexplained disappearances tragic accidents sudden death and acts of sabotage . We know Deakin can not be responsible but if not him then who ? ` Breakheart Pass ' is far from Maclean 's best book . It has a similar lighthearted and selfconsciously silly feel as say ` Caravan To Vaccares ' the interactions between Deakin and Marcia Fairchild mirror the somewhat cheesy backandforth between Neil Bowman and Cecile Dubois for example . But it does have a couple of advantages over other Maclean books published around this time.Firstly there is actually some suspense and surprise in how the story unfolds . The whodunit factor played a major role in Maclean 's early classics but in many of his later books the villain was easily identified . Here there is a reasonably large cast of characters all of whom are plausible suspects but none of whom have an obvious motive . Drawing threedimensional characters was never a Maclean strong point here though since they could all potentially be a goodie or a baddie there is a bit of depth and mysteriousness to many of them . There are also some nice twists as the plot evolves as the motive for stopping a train of Cavalry troops is not immediately obvious.Secondly there is quite alot of action compared to Maclean 's later yawnfests . Setting the book on a speeding train in the Wild West gives Maclean a chance to throw in all manner of gunfights jumping from train rooftops Indian attacks blowing up of tracks and some good old fashioned fisticuffs . In fact once the plot has been established it 's pretty much action all the way . While it 's not the heartpounding suspense of Maclean 's best work it sure beats the boring talkiness of most of his later books.So ` Breakheart Pass ' is not Maclean 's best but it 's definitely not his worst either and the unique setting and style makes it distinctive within Maclean 's catalogue . Probably not the best place to start begin with his classics from the 50 's and 60 's but there 's still enough spark there to keep this an engaging and exciting read.3.5 stars ",2
"My first exposure to Allistair MacLean is seeing the movie adaptation of Breakheart Pass . Years later I picked up another of MacLean 's novels and thought it reminded me of the movie . Then I found the book version and read it.Breakheart Pass is MacLean at its best . The ending may not be the strongest but compared to his other books it is better than the norm of MacLean wrapups.This is an adventure a thriller and a mystery set in the old west . It keeps you guessing when you 're not at the edge of your seat . ",4
"When I was a kid I read every single one of MacLean 's novels and this was the one I found hardest to put down ! With a plot involving a Pinkerton agent on board a train in the American West it is somewhat different from other MacLean novels but just as authentic and exciting ! If you 're a MacLean fan it 'd be well worth your time to track down an edition of this overlooked gem . ",4
"This book from 1974 was quite a departure for Maclean this his only book using the West as a background . His suspense novels circle the globe but none were to be set in the American west such as this one . His approach is good one and adds something to our vision of the west . Actually that vision turns out to be quite good in its approach even if a bit typical . While not entirely formulaic the novel does follow certain acceptable lines but to be able to read the story and then to watch it unfold before your eyes in living color on a DVD is excellent indeed . I read a lot of westerns Both the novel and the movie have several differences it is true but both are good in my opinion with the screen version coming out a little ahead . Maclean wrote them both so it was as he wanted it I suppose.Having read the book a few times since that summer of '74 and seen the movie several times as well I find both quite enjoyable . I have both the hardcover and the DVD You may find either to your liking and enjoymentalso . ",3
"Unfortunately I found this novel to epitomize trite stereotypes of the fading Wild West . The author is an Englishman who wrote the book from England . His observations and character developments are over the top and clearly based on the stereotypes of Western Americans that were widely circulated in Europe.It was really tough to get past the first chapter . ",1
"A highly enjoyable quickpaced book . MacLean has more hits on his list than misses and this is near the top of the hits . You ca n't trust anyone on board the train to be telling the truth even the hero . Great setting as the train chugs its way through the mountains less enjoyable once the destination is reached but we do n't spend all that much time there . Truly getting there is more than half the fun . ",4
"Fun escapism in print and in the film version . McLean is a master of the action genre where tension is maintained simultaneously across a number of points of view . ",4
"172 pages of dense smallish print . Very deceiving little paperback . A spy thriller written in 1966 . Somewhat exciting but not very . Mostly plodding I thought if wellwritten . Some beautiful descriptions . Takes place in Bangkok which I have been to but only the river there is something I remember . Certainly not street names which Hall uses a lot . Well plotted could n't find a flaw anywhere just went on too long for me . But I will admit that this genre has never had much appeal to me so that may be my problem . Quiller in Bangkok trying to protect the Person a huge English dignitary probably meant to be Prince Phillip but that is my own interpretation who is coming on an official state visit . Possible Spoiler Alert So Quiller is all set up to shoot the assassin halfway through the novel and he does only to find that the killer was a decoy and the Person has been abducted . To be held for a swap with a Chinese being held in Durham who has memorized a whole lot of English data on new laser technology which would be terrible for the Chinese government to get hold of . Anyway you get the picture . So the last half Quiller is trying to get the Person back . My husband loved it . Maybe a guy thing . ",2
"Yes'The Quiller Memorandum ' got all the hype and awards as the first in the series but was far from a perfect midsixties espionage novel . Adam Hall got all the ingredients right in this second installment The Nineth Directive . The pacing is taut the plot is quite developed for its day . The action is wellscripted and the local color is used to great affect . He sews up most of the loose ends nicely.The Queen 's consort never identified by name is on a diplomatic mission to Thailand and Quiller is sent to protect him . Things do not go quite as planned and Quiller must use his imagination to rescue from the jaws of failure what appears to be a doomed mission.Do not be put off by reviews of this novel as a 'moldy oldie ' . Quiller novels are period pieces like Jack Higgins thrillers or Le Carre 's novels of the day . Study up on 1960 's sociopolitical history to get the maximum benefit from the stories . If you 're expecting techno babble look elsewhere . If you enjoy disengaging from current events and taking an actionpacked ride to the height of the cold war you can not go wrong with the Nineth Directive . ",4
"This is one of Hall 's Quiller espionage novels and the cool thing about this one is that it is set in Bangkok back in 1966 when the novel was first published . Like other novels in the Quiller series this is fastpaced full of crisp dialogue and well written . Even tough it was written over 45 years ago it still holds up very well . An espionage classic . ",4
"THE NINTH DIRECTIVE was Adam Hall 's second book featuring the secret agent Quiller and it 's one of his best . This mission has Quiller traveling to Bangkok Thailand to stop an elite assassination team from killing an important British person never named but implied to be the Queen 's Consort . Quiller is able to identify the ambush point along the parade route but things do not go quite as he had anticipated . ",4
"I found The Ninth Directive so delicious I read it slowly a chapter at a time.I read the first book in the series The Quiller Memorandum years ago and enjoyed it . I wo n't wait so long to move on to the third book The Striker Portfolio.It 's great that this is back in print . It ought to be an eBook as well . Highly recommended . ",4
"What started as quite interesting turned out to be rather mundane . Quiller superbrain and second in worldimportance only to The Person fails to foresee what most readers would have guessed from the beginning . Never once does he suspect that when everything goes everso smoothly something may not be quite as it seems . When I bought this ebook I was thinking of The Quiller Memorandum which I remembered as very good . The Ninth Directive did n't come close to it in my mind . ",1
"If you have never read the Qiller books from Adam Hall now is the time to start . Qiller is a niche an acquired taste a flawed man with a strong selfdestructive streak . However I think the strongest part of a Quiller novel is the writing . Up front it is sometimes flawed . Sometimes clunky . But Hall a nom de plume ' uses techniques that are unique . He sometimes runs on and on with no punctuation driving the reader at a blinding speed . He will intentionally leave you confused . He frequently just stops . Picking up the story at a later point . Really interesting attempts to explore form . Violent . You get the feeling that the sex was tacked on as an after thought to punch up the story line . It was the '70 's you know Quiller is a spy without the gadgets . This is n't deep literature . More of a tiltawhirl than a quiet garden . Always fun . ",3
"The Bureau sends Quiller to Bangkok to protect an important British official who will be visiting Thailand . Quiller approaches the job in his usual efficient albeit grouchy style but finds himself outsmarted at least for awhile.Quiller is a welldefined character independent even antisocial perhaps suffering from a perhaps justified superiority complex . The other characters are more like caricatures but the enjoyment of this novel comes from the intricate twisty plot and from Quiller himself as he tries to outthink his adversary . Quiller is an intellectual spy but there 's plenty of action to offset the thinking and scheming . Fans of espionagethriller novels should enjoy this . ",3
"This thriller novel kicks off with Dr. Carpenter a British medical doctor who gets orders to board the USS Dolphin in the UK . The US nuclear submarine Dolphin has a nearimpossible mission it has to cruise underneath the ice pack of the Arctic to find and save the inhabitants of Ice Station Zebra a scientific meteorological station drifting with the ice pack somewhere north of the Arctic Circle . Ice Station Zebra was destroyed by a fire but little does anyone know that fire at Ice Station Zebra was due to sabotage and that one of the survivors is a ruthless killer . Furthermore Dr. Carpenter is not what he seems to be and it later becomes evident that he has more staked in this cruise than originally suggested.What I liked about the story is how Alistair MacLean demonstrated his writing ability and mastery of the genre to create an atmosphere that gets the reader to feel that heshe is also inside the submarine and can sense feel smell and experience the conflict fear and tension on board the submarine . Definitely not as turbopaced as Matthew Reilly 's more modern thriller novel with a nearly similar name Ice Station MacLean 's book does not lack in pace but the pace is controlled to such a degree that the right amount of suspense is created and that the tension builds up as the story progresses . Reilly 's Ice Station is more about countless pages of jetpropelled action and relentless mindless violence whereas MacLean 's Ice Station Zebra consists of the finesse of expert handling of suspense intrigue and tension.Although the dialogue may be more reminiscent of the era that the book was written in this is truly still a masterpiece of the thriller genre and can almost serve as a template for thriller writers where you have a plot stripped of all the unnecessary fluff that so many modern thrillers suffer from which only serves to increase the page count and nothing much else .

"A British meterological station is in danger and those staffing it will soon be dead without help . An American nuclear sub is sent out to help them along with a doctor that is an expert in the sort of afflictions they may have developed.However this American sub also has an underlying spook mission to go along with the rescue . This hidden agenda causes a hell of a lot of problems and casualiies throughout . ",3
"The is the first of MacLean 's books I can recall reading and it 's not bad . Readers accustomed to modern thrillers that bolt out of the gate at 100 miles an hour should bear in mind this was written about 35 years ago when authors were allowed to build up tension . A mysterious British specialist boards a U.S. submarine that has been urgently dispatched to figure out what has happened to Ice Station Zebra a top secret base drifting on ice near the North Pole . After many travails the specialist reaches the burned out station and quickly figures out that one of the nine survivors deliberately set the fire and murdered some of his colleagues . The survivors all board the submarine which experiences a string of suspicious accidents deaths and disasters . The idea is a good one but MacLean 's characters are little more than onedimensional . The superbly talented specialist is carrying a dark secret the U.S. submariners are all superheroes and like a previous reviewer I was pretty sure I knew who the villain was the first time he appeared in print .

"Alistair MacLean 's 1963 Cold War thriller Ice Station Zebra opens with a British doctor named Carpenter trying to talk his way aboard the American Navy 's nuclear submarine Dolphin in a lonely harbor in Scotland . His announced mission is to organize the rescue of the crew of a British meteorological station on an ice island in the Arctic victims of a deadly fire . As with many MacLean novels neither the leading characters nor the mission are quite what they appear to be.Ice Station Zebra traces the Dolphin 's exciting run under the polar ice pack to reach the last know location of Ice Station Zebra . There Dr. Carpenter and a group of volunteers from the crew of Dolphin will dare the weather and the ice pack to find the station and rescue its stricken crew . Carpenter quickly discovers that the fire at Ice Station Zebra was no accident among the surviving members of the Ice Station is a ruthless killer who will stop at nothing including holding at risk the Dolphin to achieve his mysterious purpose . Carpenter himself proves to have a very personal stake in the outcome of the struggle with the killer . MacLean 's brisk prose and sardonic dialogue keep the suspense crackling to the very last page.By the time he wrote Ice Station Zebra MacLean had become a highly proficient storyteller . If parts of this novel seem a little contrived the wise reader will relax and enjoy the ride . This novel is highly recommended to fans of the Cold War spy story and to fans of Alistair MacLean master storyteller . ",3
"In Ice Station Zebra a British secret service agent is given the aid of a U.S. nuclear submarine to investigate the fire that destroyed Ice Station Zebra a weather research station that is also testing intelligence technology.Alistair MacLean really knows how to set up a story and characters . Within a few pages we know the gritty world of the submarine the hardbitten men who serve in her and the intense preoccupation of Carpenter the narrator who has both a professional and personal stake in discovering the fate of the ice station and the secret technology . MacLean is outstanding when he writes about jeopardy and the men and the sub are in constant danger throughout the book.I found the resolution of the mystery very disappointing and substandard straight out of an old Columbo in which the rumpled detective assembled the suspects in a room and then talked us through the unlikely scenario that made that person the murderer . It was made even worse by the fact that I guessed who the killer was on the very first page in which the character appeared.For that reason I could n't really recommend this particular book though I am a fan of the author and plan to read more of his thrillers in the future.Reviewer Liz Clare coauthor of the historical novel To the Ends of the Earth The Last Journey of Lewis and Clark ",1
"This is a story set at the height of the Cold War and it still works wonderfully . MacLean while short on fleshing out characters is exceptional at action and moving the story along at a brisk pace . Throughout this novel even though I had an idea of what was going to happen and even guessed some of the mysteries do n't want to spoil it for others I enjoyed it immensely . This is not a by the numbers espionage novel where the big 'reveals ' are the only payoffs.The story centers around a station set up in the Arctic where a meteorological station has been established but is in trouble and is sending out SOS and so the US sends a nuclear submarine under the ice to rescue them . Along the way there is sabotage harrowing fascinating moments of finding a place to break through the ice and pure adventure . I loved this part of the novel when they were trying to find the drifting station.There are surprises and of course there are people who are n't what they appear aka spies which drives the final half of the novel to a very satisfying conclusion . Particularly frightening was a fire on the sub.I studied on a sub so I found it to be very realistic and innovative . MacLean clearly did his homework.Highly recommended ! ",4
"One of Alistair MacLean 's finest suspense thrillers . It may be more well known to some readers as a movie with Rock Hudson . Suffice to say MacLean 's novel is much better in terms of plot suspense and coherence . The scriptwriters were morons they should have stayed with MacLean 's plot . The movie changes the ending and again the ending is better in the book . So if you 've seen the film do n't think everything in the book is the same . It 's not.MacLean seemed to feel at home in the Arctic . Several of his novels take place in the icy area and he always writes about it with skill . If you are reading one of his Arctic novels even if it 's July in Florida you will feel chilled until you put the book down.The characters are welldrawn the plot is firstrate the writing is excellence and the twists will keep the reading guessing . The movie theme was excellent and Patrick McGoohan had a great role as the British agent in the film but those were the only two items noteworthy in the cinema version.It 's a great cold war thriller . ",4
"Anyone with a taste for naval warfare mysteries and the Arctic in general will find this a fascinating read . I first read this book in my teens . I still return to it occasionally and never find it boring . I have n't watched the 1968 movie version of this book . ",4
"The Arctic meteorological base Drift Ice Station Zebra has suffered a catastrophic fire with several men killed and the remainder desperately clinging to survival in the frozen wasteland . As the US Navy 's latest submarine USS Dolphin prepares to make a mercy dash to Ice Station Zebra they are joined by British doctor Neil Carpenter an alleged expert in Arctic survival . But Carpenter is not all he seems and it is clear that Ice Station Zebra is not all it appears to be either . Carpenter suspects that the fire was no accident and a series of hostile acts aimed at the Dolphin convinces him that something is very far wrong . What was Ice Station Zebra 's true purpose what caused the fire that destroyed the base and are one or more of the survivors responsible ? And who is Dr Carpenter a man who abilities go well beyond setting broken bones ? ` Ice Station Zebra ' is one of Maclean 's better books written during the middle of his golden run in the 1950 's and 60 's . All of the Maclean elements are in place . The drywitted laconic characters with protagonist Carpenter clearly knowing more than what he is letting on . The workings of a naval vessel in this case a submarine instead of a ship and the men who serve in them . The Whodunnit locked room mystery set in an unusual location . And above all the realistic and detailed descriptions of the harsh bleak Arctic environment . Fans of Maclean 's other Arctic mysteries like ` Night Without End ' and ` Bear Island ' will find plenty to love here.There is perhaps a little less action than in some of his other books ` Ice Station Zebra ' is more of a descriptive piece with mystery elements than a straightout action thriller . But Maclean is able to use the slower pace of the book very cleverly . The mystery behind this Arctic research station and of Carpenter himself is revealed only gradually with Carpenter openly admitting that he is not telling all his secrets . And the increasingly serious accidents which befall the Dolphin help set up a tension that only heightens with each new disaster . The claustrophobic environment of the submarine along with the knowledge that the crew may be carrying a killer on board only adds to the foreboding.After this great buildup though the ending does let the book down just a little . While the final revelation of the purpose of Zebra and the reason for the killings is interesting enough the revelation of the guilty party is not surprising . Although there are plenty of potential suspects only a few of the characters from Zebra are well developed and so you pretty much know that the killer has to be one of them . And that old plot device where the protagonist plays dumb and lures the guilty party into making a boastful confession has been used by Maclean several times before and is a bit of a cop out really.Still ` Ice Station Zebra ' is definitely one of Maclean 's better efforts and he is back in the environment that he writes about best . Four stars . ",3

"There 's an old saying . Write what you know . Alistair MacLean is Scottish and so consequently what he knows most is how to write British characters and weirdly Germans he tends to write them fairly well . Americans ? Not so much . In fact I 've yet to encounter a believable American character in a single one of his books and the otherwise excellent Ice Station Zebra is a good example of this.In novels such as The Guns of Navarone and Where Eagles Dare this problem is limited because each of those books has only a single American in them but in Ice Station Zebra we get an entire American submarine crew and MacLean 's inability to write believable Americans becomes glaringly apparent.I do n't mean their personalities and motivations I mean their dialogue . Every time an American character opens their mouth nothing they say rings true . Everything from how they phrase things to their banter to their word choices is distinctly British . It reads like MacLean has never met any American servicemen and wrote their dialogue based solely on what he 'd experienced living in the UK . The end result is a bunch of American submariners who sound like British guys.While the novel overall is excellent suspenseful exciting etc . I think it 's obvious that MacLean bit off more than he could chew by trying to write an entire American submarine crew . He should 've just had them be British . ",3
"intriguing and it keeps on your toes till the end . Interesting when it describe the submarine and tactics . Dr. Carpenter character is very special and his relations with members of the crew are a plus to the story ",4
"This is the way action novels should be written taut interestingand loaded with realistic plot twists . Anyone writing a thriller today would do well to read this novel and realize that true writing does not require heavy amounts of sick glossy violence and unneccessary sex . Besides a crackling story the characters are smart and show a good bit of depth . It requires you to figure who the antagonist might be . One of my favorite passages is during the accident in the Engineroomtalk abut cold ! But I wo n't say anymore because I do not wish to ruin anymore of the plot . Bruce from Camaroon take a clue No one reads these reviews to be told who the bad guy is that 's what keeps them reading . All and all an excellent read ! ",4
"Ice Station Zebra an arctic meteorological station located on the ever drifting pack ice of the high Arctic has been destroyed by an equipment fire . The Dolphin an American nuclear submarine is about to set sail on a dangerous high speed mission under the polar ice cap to rescue the badly injured team . But just as one would suspect from a cold war thriller all is not as it seems . Ice Station Zebra is a good deal more than just a scientific meteorological station . The scientific team is not just a collection of scientists . One of them is a ruthless killer for which the achievement of his mysterious secret mission against the Americans and the Brits may even require the coldblooded execution of the entire crew of the Dolphin . Nor is Doctor Carpenter a British volunteer member of the Dolphin 's crew ostensibly along to seek out his brother who was part of Ice Station Zebra 's stricken team precisely what he shows to the world.As thrillers go Ice Station Zebra is certainly enjoyable but it 's a long long way from what most readers would label a compelling page turner . It 's got all the requisite ingredients to be sure murder sabotage hidden identities spies accidents cliffhangers but I think it could have been so much more . The parts of the story that took place inside the submarine were interesting and at times even exciting . But the action never reached the breathless urgent pace that was more recently achieved in other submarine thrillers such as Hunt for Red October or Larry Bond 's Dangerous Ground . The Arctic itself as an environment which can be stunning in its breathtaking beauty and is always fraught with danger and the potential for deadly accidents was never truly exploited as a part of the story to anywhere near the extent that it might have been.Ice Station Zebra is an enjoyable change of pace and nice easy brain candy reading that wo n't tax the little grey cells . It just wo n't make anyone 's top ten list of the best alltime spy vs spy thrillers ! Recommended.Paul Weiss ",2
"I have friends who found this book boring and I think I see what they mean . Ice Station Zebra does not have the nonstop action pace of modern thrillers . What it does have to an exceptional degree is vivid characterization enjoyable writing and a sustained buildup of tension that enables the reader to miss the occasional hole in the plot . Something I truly love about this book is that there is no fat on its frame no gratuitous violence zero sex no hype . In some ways it strikes me as a model for the successful thriller in its purest form with everything potentially inessential stripped away and I reread it every year or two just for the sheer fun of it .

"I have long loved the movie version of Ice Station Zebra which I first saw in my teens when the film was fairly new . I had been promising to buy and read the novel for many years now and finally decided that this year 's summer vacation was the ideal time.I honestly wish I 'd never bothered.The writing in the first part of the book is so slow I almost gave up . The characters are not believable and the situation is unconvincing and farcically so by turns.I 'm not by any means a demanding reader but in light of my finally reading the book I have to say it is a mystery to me why anyone would option it for a film . The story as written could not be filmed due to suspension of disbelief problems and hackneyed and unbelievable I know what 's going on but I 'm not going to tell you just yet behavior of the guest aboard the submarine used to keep the story going because without that it would collapse around itself.I recommend people stick to the film for the best telling of the events at Ice Station Zebra .

"This was the first work of Mr. MacLean 's that I read and it left me spellbound up to the last page . I saw the movie first but the book far ourweighed it for suspense intrigue and action . The author 's style of writing is similar to that of the Quiller novels yet he has his own fingerprint that kept me guessing how the Dolphin was going to fare out . I will be reading The Secret Ways and Circus nextI highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoy 's a thinking person 's thriller . ",4
"Whose work are we actually reading at this point ? There were already major differences in punctuation word choices and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead editions of this novel . There were further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random HouseAvenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & ShusterPocket . There are further additions still in the recent Signet Berkley and Leventhal and Black editions . For every publishing house putting out her works there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie 's words and the sound of her voice . Here the publishers at Collins dissatisfied with their own earlier efforts put still more distance between author and public with a New Ed edition . What 's the matter with these publishers ? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie ? And what will she sound like twenty years from now ? It 's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them . Please tell me I 'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed . ",4
"The plot is simple the characters memorable and the clues motives and suspects pure Christie in this wonderful mystery that takes place at an English boarding school for girls.A young prince of a Middle East kingdom is killed in a flying accident and leaves behind a valuable collection of jewels to be smuggled into England by his friend Bob Rawlinson . It is believed the jewels will turn up at Meadowbank School since not only the prince 's sister but also the sister and niece of Bob Rawlinson are all students there . Not surprisingly murder after murder takes place at the prestigious school . Everyone from the headmistress and teachers to the students and parents are suspects until Poirot 's clever little grey cells solve the mystery . ",3
"A longer novel than usual for Christie Cat Among the Pigeons deals with international intrigue at an exclusive English girls ' school . A coup in the Middle East triggers off a deadly search for missing jewels . Action converges on the school . The Special Branch and local police try to solve the string of murders among the schoolmistresses but it takes Hercule Poirot 's little grey cells to see through the disguises and subterfuge and bring all the loose ends together . The plot seemed flimsy at times and some of the attitudes expressed in the novel made it appear dated in the extreme . For a better Agatha Christie set partly in the Middle East I would recommend They Came To Bagdad . ",2
"School Escape.Cat Among the Pigeons is a mystery involving a tiny tinpot country revolution and jewellery.Poirot gets involved with an investigation at a very toffy girl 's school and he does n't really expect to get involved in international intrigue but it does n't take him long to work out something odd is going on .

"Cat Among the Pigeons by Agatha ChristieBlack Dog & Leventhal 1959297 pagesHercule Poirot Mystery45 starsSummary Meadowbank School is an outstanding school for young girls which is suddenly rocked by the murder of the new games mistress . Was she too curious for her own good ? Does it have some connection to the recent revolution in a Near East country ? Hint yes Never fear Hercule Poirot and his little grey cells are on the case.Thoughts The book opens with a four page list of the characters which I read hoping to get set for reading this . Instead it overwhelmed me and I had to just keep reading in order to be able to follow it . There are a lot of characters mostly female because the actions takes place at a fine girls ' school . The opening is very confusing as it shifts from Meadowbank to that Near East country to two females who connect both places . Headmistress Miss Bulstrode of course made me think of Millicent Bulstrode of Slytherin but luckily she 's a much nicer person and Eileen Rich is consistently described as ugly although I can not fathom why that 's relevant to the story.There seem to be long passages where nothing is really happening . I found it easy to read and I was motivated to finish it . Interestingly Poirot does n't show up until basically twothirds of the way through the book . Yet he solves it fairly easily by picking up on a few strands . I did n't solve the murder er murders but I do n't mind . I should have noticed something was up about that person but I did n't connect it fast enough . I also thought there was going to be a romance I like the little romances Christie sometimes throws in but I was wrong.Overall A fine outing although somewhat confusing and less engaging than Christie 's best . Do not begin your exploration of Christie with this . ",3
"This is my first experience with Agatha Christie . Mystery is not a genre I read a lot of but Christie is so wellknown I thought I 'd give it a shot . Many novels do have elements of mystery in them of course particularly in hiding certain plot points or motivations until the end so I am familiar with the conventions . I find that mystery like many other things in life is at its best before everything is revealed . Monster movies are always scarier when you do n't see the monster than when you do . Cat Among the Pigeons is no different . I think it has a satisfying reveal but Christie cheats a little to throw us off track.I like Christie 's writing style . She sprinkles plenty of wit and humor throughout her storytelling . There is a general feeling amongst the characters that there is a cat among the pigeons . Somebody does n't belong but nobody can put their finger on who . The reader will have their guesses of course based on evidence and hunches . Christie throws out plenty of red herrings and it 's our job to try and see past these distractions . I had an idea of who the murderer was but I was proved wrong . At first I was okay with this but as Christie revealed more details I felt like she cheated . Something happens that leads us off the trail of the killer and while there is motivation behind this something that happens it is nonetheless difficult to believe it would happen . I will leave this vague so as not to spoil anything for you.Other than this there was plenty to enjoy . The description of the workings of Meadowbank were fun to read as was getting to know the key characters like Miss Bulstrode who seems to amaze everybody even the narrator . The introduction of Hercule Poirot feels random but I guess it is necessary to solve the mystery . The early scenes in Ramat were also effective . There 's a brief moment of interesting political discussion that took me off guard . The prince of Ramat ca n't understand why his people want to rebel against him . He wants to enact welfare programs to help his people where his father was a murderous tyrant . Yet they want to oust the nice one . He 's hurt and bewildered by these developments . It 's as though his people are n't ready for a progressive leader just yet . The prince is left wondering the same thing as Miss Bulsrode why murder at all ? ",3
"For Agatha fanatics only . The plot relies on unconvincing behaviour in Chapter 1 . This book reads like a serial for Girls Crystal and I suspect it was written long before Collins Crime Club published it in 1959 . The author in 1959 was aged 69 and at the height of her fame . Did she salvage this from early efforts in her Rejects drawer and tack on Poirot in the last 70 pages ? That 's the impression I get.Nevertheless the writing is good the characters fascinating . Subtle copy editing would help . For instance when a 15yearold schoolgirl pulls up the leg of her knickers Poirot ` ejaculated ' . Modern readers please note older dictionaries restrict the meaning of this word to ` exclaim'.One thing nothing can help is the divine inspiration that helps Poirot explain everything using weird twists of logic . But does n't he always ! ",1
"I admit that I like oldfashioned books like Agatha Christie 's . For me this was not a typical Christie book which is probably one of the things I like about her so much I find that often her books are not quite what I expect them to be . In this case a coup in a Middle Eastern country a missing sack of precious jewels and murder at an exclusive girls ' school in England mix for a fun and fast read . I like the way Christie does international intrigue and it 's also interesting to see how the unrest in the Middle East of the 1950s continues today.Another interesting thing about the book is that Hercule Poirot does n't show up until the last third . As much as I like Christie a little bit of Hercule goes a long way . I often find the mysteries in the Hercule books better than the mysteries in the Miss Marple books but I do enjoy Miss Marple 's company more . So this was just the right amount of M. Poirot for me . As usual he asks his crazy questions like Did anyone notice her knees ? that turn out to be quite useful in uncovering the mystery.Something else I noticed was Christie 's wit . Interestingly I do n't usually think of Christie as in the witty category but there is a nice sprightliness in the book that keeps the pages turning . The characters are well drawn too I know there are critics who complain about Christie 's lack of characterization but the personalities at the girls ' school are very nicely drawn . Overall I enjoyed the mixing of the genres here and found CAT AMONG THE PIGEONS to be a pleasant summer read . Of course it 's not one of her very greatest like TEN LITTLE INDIANS MURDER ON THE O . EXPRESS ROGER ACKROYD but it 's not one of her pretty bad ones like ELEPHANTS CAN REMEMBER or POSTERN OF FATE.Enjoy and if you have a teenager who likes mystery get him or her into trying Agatha Christie . A great way to help teenagers become lifelong readers . ",3

"I am enjoying reading Agatha Christie for the second time and have decided to collect her books . I first read her books in the 80 's . I have been very happy with the books I have purchased through Amazon.com . I have never had a bad experience with any of the books that I have purchased through you . Thank you . ",4
"I am a great Agatha Christie fan and have all her books . I am very busy now so do not have time to sit down and reread them . It is great fun to listen to them in the car as I travel from place to place . I really can not get enough of them ",4
"I have recently decided to revisit the wonderfully entertaining works of Dame Agatha Christie . And after a more than thirty year hiatus I have found the reading as fresh and entertaining as ever . The author has an engaging style that holds the attention throughout the writing and this is certainly evident in Cat Among the Pigeons . From the first pages the reader is provided with a detailed and intimate acquaintance with the physical setting as well as the characters and this is developed and carried throughout the ensuing pages . I especially enjoyed the appearance of the indomitable Hercule Poirot in the later chapters and the cool development of his part in the solution to the mystery at hand . I have made a vow with my little grey cells to reread every one of Dame Agatha ' s Poirot collection as well as her other works . ",4
"This volume is anything but a regular Hercule Poirot mystery Poirot first appears only at 68 % into the book ! As is wellknown Conan Doyle got sick of Sherlock Holmes over time and Christie got sick of Poirot over time . She keeps Poirot 's role to an absolute minimum in _Cat Among the Pigeons_ it almost feels perfunctory Sigh if I absolutely must introduce him here he is at long last . We get to spend very little time in Poirot 's presence in this volume his input corresponds more to a Poirot short story than that of a fulllength novel . We only infrequently get to hear his voice here such as when delivering in chapter 19 the following variation on one of his timeworn observations & lt & lt It is very valuable conversation . Sooner or later if one has something to hide one says too much . > > The good news is Poirot 's presence in the bulk of the book is not really missed . Christie was 70 when _Cat Among the Pigeons_ was first released in 1959 but the schoolgirls milieu is depicted with such sprightliness and freshness of perspective that a fellow Amazon reviewer voiced the suspicion that the bulk of the story must have been written decades earlier by a much younger Agatha Christie . That sounds plausible but is ultimately irrelevant . What matters is that the action truly is exciting and energetic the dialogues are witty and everything moves along at a brisk pace . Who needs Poirot then ? Some reviewers complain of a late murder but I did not find that to be the case the first murder occurs in chapter 8 out of 25 and the second in chapter 15 out of 25 that is nicely spaced out I 'd say . It is also advertised as such right in the Table of Contents so that there is no nervousness really for the readers as to when the evil deed is finally going to happen.The most interesting strongest character in the book is that of the girls ' school head teacher Miss Bulstrode . Christie offers some nicely drawn psychological observations as to what it takes to be a good people manager to employ 21st century parlance . In exploring this subject _Cat Among the Pigeons_ is remindful of one of Christie 's masterpieces from two decades earlier _Murder in Mesopotamia_ . Here is a sample from chapter 9 & lt & lt She reminded him a little of Miss Bulstrode herself she was the schoolmistress type all right . All the same he reflected Miss Bulstrode had something that Miss Vansittart had not . Miss Bulstrode had a quality of unexpectedness . He did not feel that Miss Vansittart would ever be unexpected . > > Christie 's favourite paranoia that of utter uncertainty in life when it comes to truly knowing your fellow human beings is also very much present quoted from chapter 21 & lt & lt One never really knew she thought about anybody . > > Finally the volume is a combo of a classic British whodunnit with an international espionage plot outwardly ridiculous yet even these minimalistic snapshots of revolutionary turmoil in a fictitious MiddleEastern country called Ramat are nicely executed by Christie . Talk about plastic portrayal ! _Cat Among the Pigeons_ is a satisfying read no masterpiece but among the best within Christie 's rather weak output in the final decades of her long writing career .

"Agatha Christie 18901976 is generally thought of a mystery novelist the creator of Hercule Poirot and Jane Marplebut she varied her output from time to time writing several celebrated plays numerous short stories and occasionally turning out a novel that was more of a thriller than a mystery . Such is the case with the 1959 novel CAT AMONG THE PIGEONS which begins lightly enough among school girls attending the famous Meadowbank school in England and then unexpectedly seques to a revolution in the middle east stolen jewels a kidnapping and three murders.Although most of the story plays out at Meadowbanks the plot pivot is in the middle east where revolution threatens progressive Prince Ali Yusuf . In an effort to protect himself and at least part of his fortune the prince gives his personal pilot Bob Rawlinson an extremely valuble package of jewels and asks Rawlinson to find a way to move them to England . Rawlinson agrees and hides the jewels among the luggage carried by his unwitting sister and niece who are visiting the area but are scheduled to return to England shortly . That same day Rawlinson and the prince attempt to escape the country on an airplane but sabatoge causes the aircraft to crash and both are killed . It becomes apparent that the jewels are not among Bob 's sister 's luggage the must therefore be in the luggage of his neice schoolgirl Jennifer . To further complicate matters Jennifer is not the only student at Meadowbanks with a connection to prince Ali Yusuf his cousin Shaista is a student as well and it seems likely that the jewels will find their way to her.No sooner are the girls settled at Meadowbanks than not one but two murders occur . Fortunately Jennifer has a sharpminded school friend named Julia Upjohn daughter of a woman who worked in military intelligence during World War II . Julia soon realizes that there is a problem unravels the story of the missing jewels and after an inspired guess locates them as well . But now her own life is in danger and Julia wastes no time in going to the celebrated Hercule Poirot who produces a final solutionbut not before a third death ensues.CAT AMONG THE PIGEONS is not among the first rank of Christie 's novels although she clearly had fun writing it and writing similar novels her gifts did indeed turn more toward the intricate plotting required of her mysteries and less toward the actionadventure required of a thriller . Even so it is a very enjoyable readfor both fans and newcomers a like . Recommended.GFT Amazon ReviewerIn Memory of Floy Bennett ",3
"1959 . The year I was born . The year of classics by English cloak and dagger authors Allistair MacLean 's The Last Frontier and Night Without End and Ian Fleming 's Goldfinger . Another well known Brit also made an experiment into spy thrillers that same year but Dame Agatha Christie is better known for her mysteries.Unlike her '54 story Destination Unknown which was more espionage than murder mystery Cat Among The Pigeons tries to balance between the two genres and may be in a no man 's land that purists of either do n't care for . Another peculiarity this is a Hercule Poirot story . In the cast of characters listed in order of appearance which I do n't like because the descriptions give too much away the Belgian sleuth is the next to the last name mentioned just beneath his valet Georges . The star assuming Poirot is the star does n't appear until chapter 17 out of 25 chapters plus prologue.This is not a textbook example for writers nor does this deem to be classified as one of Agatha 's greatest . However you still have interesting characters with a plot that takes twists and turns that might catch you by surprise . I have previously seen David Suchet 's adaptation of this story which was fairly faithful except of course Poirot shows up much earlier in the movie so I did know where things were going a little more than someone who didn't.If you enjoy Agatha Christie in particular or cozy mysteries in general or you want to read something that 's not as easy to pigeonhole give this book a try .

"This 1959 novel begins in a fictional mideastern country . The country is on the brink of revolution the young prince is planning his escape he entrusts the family fortune in gems to his closest friend to smuggle out of the country . Arrangements are made shortly before the two young men are killed.Meanwhile back in England it is the beginning of the summer term at Meadowlands an exclusive girls ' school . Students and staff from all over the world are there including a princess from the mideast whose cousinfiance has just been killed . The famous gems have also found there way there . Various unusual occurances begin to take place at the school strange visitors unusual behavior among the staff and then murder and kidnapping.One of the students uncovers part of the secret and decides that she needs outside help so she contacts Hercule Poirot . Poirot of course resolves the mysteries both large and small that have been plaguing the school.There are more characters introduced in this novel than is usual in Christie 's work which makes this one of the more challenging of her work to figure out . There are several subplots woven into the action that things confusing as well . This is a departure from Christie 's usual 'cozy ' stories of village life or house parties . It is more of a thriller than her usual work some of her most sympathetic characters are killed and Poirot only appears at the end of the novel . Even so it is a very enjoyable mystery and one of my personal favorites.We are also treated to an update on the Summerhills old friends from a previous book MRS. McGINTY 'S DEAD . Mrs. Summerhill is a friend of one of the students ' parents . Poirot is delighted to hear that although Mrs. Summerhill 's house is still disorganized and her cooking is generally deplorable she makes wonderful omelets a skill that she learned from him . ",4
"After completing this fast paced character driven thrillermystery I immediately stocked up with more Christie titles . Slueth extrodinaire Poirot makes an unusally late appearance but this serves to only highten his effectiveness and our interest . Ms. Christie 's masteries include the ability to make us like and even care about characters in as little as 2 or 3 sentences . By doing this she clouds our judgement on motive deception and the ability to deduce what only becomes obvious after another classic Poirot confrontations with the suspects . This is one Christie 's best later works . ",4
"I 'm a Christie fan from way back . Having my books on CD is wonderful . They are well narrated and entertaining and I can do housework while I am listening to my favorite author . Thanks ! ",4
"Cat Among The Pigeons is a Classic Hercule Poirot Mystery . Every home library should have this collection . Books that make you think.. ",4
"This is one of my favorite books from Agatha Christie 's later years . Her grip of story telling plotting and planning is still strong . There is some humor in the narrative and amusement is provided by many of the characters.Agatha Christie tries her hand at the girls ' school setting here . Older reader will suspect that she was wellacquainted with similar settings chosen by A A Milne and Dorothy Sayers and that she had been brought up on the once popular school girl annuals . Of course there needs to be a raison d'tre behind the series of murders that occurs at the school and this is well narrated also.I have mentioned the narration several times . It is an element that helps explain this writer 's phenomenal popularity . She gets the timing right . Other writers in this genre produce more elegant prose but somehow fail in this regard.At this time in her career Agatha Christie was experimenting with narrative methods . She attempted the quick scene change method here and brings it off with skill and flair . She also at this time in her career frequently milked the situation where something was briefly glimpsed in a mirror or a familiar face briefly glimpsed at a great distance . Watch out for these occurrences as you turn the pages to reach Hercule Poirot 's final revelation of just who is the cat among the pigeons . ",4
"The title of Agatha Christie & # 8217s mystery novel Cat Among the Pigeons refers to the idea of a stranger in a group . In this case the stranger is at an elite school for girls where one of the teachers is murdered . The story begins in the fictional Mideast country of Ramat where a coup is about to take place . The young ruler and his pilot prepare to escape before being killed and the ruler entrusts some valuable jewels to the pilot fearing that he the ruler will be captured . But the pilot also is afraid and decides to hide the jewels in the luggage of his sister who is in Ramat but about to return to England . He does so but is seen in the process.The story now shifts to an elite girls school in England . A woman is murdered in the sports pavilion followed by other murders and an alleged kidnapping . Finally one of the girls discovers the jewels and brings Hercule Poirot into the case . He then tracks down the killer.I like the Poirot series but rate this story rather low for two reasons . First of all Poirot does not enter the case until more than 23 of the book is over . The fun of the Poirot series is observing and following along as he unravels a case and we are denied that opportunity here . Secondly Poirot explains things too neatly and the murderer is outed in a way that is hard to believe . It is as though Christie developed the story line for too long without Poirot and decided to just end the novel abruptly in order to stay within a page limit . If you really like the Poirot series Cat Among the Pigeons is not the best choice . ",2
"This is the first Agatha Christie I have read after my class was required to read a mystery novel written by one of the authors during the Golden Age of Mystery . I have to say I was impressed . It was a little slow at the start but it is to be expected in most of her books . Once the first murder occurs though things pick up pretty fast . This takes place in one of the best girls ' schools . But what happens when the best girls ' school has a murder ? Is it the best ? See if you can find out who the killer is ! ",4
"This is one of Christie 's best later works and it shows she can still weave intricate plots and characters together with effective ease . Great atmosphere and story with Poirot popping up almost toward the end . You 'll never see any of the final threads coming . Perhaps her most entertaining book of the 1950 's . ",3
"Agatha Christie generates a lot of really interesting plots and clever twists . This book kept me guessing and I enjoyed it thoroughly . ",4
"I first read this book when I was twelve about the same age as the main characters in the story . Some of the motivations of the adults seemed murky to me but the children especially young Julia were all spot on ! Good work writing about children as is typical of Agatha CROOKED HOUSE Christie . ",4
"This was one of Agatha Christie 's not so good books . Thankfully there are n't many but they do exist . Perhaps she should not have mixed genres spy thrillers and crime . Mind you there is n't a James Bond chase scene in the book but the opening pages takes the reader to a fictional Arab nation on the verge of a coup d etat and sees its young prince exchanging ideas with his English pilot on how to smuggle out the royal jewels.I am not spoiling anyone 's surprise when I say the deaths in this novel are connected directly or indrectly to the jewels which have ended up in a girls school by the way . The three murders all come rather late in the book and as such the revelation of the culprit by Poirot feels rushed.Yes the book is touted as a Hercule Poirot mystery although we only get to see him three quarters into the story . Since almost all of the investigation was handled by the local inspector an undercover Special Branch officer and a very intelligent girl it would have been better if they tied it all up with no need for Poirot to show up.All in all I was not impressed with Cat Among the Pigeons . Those new to her work should start with other titles as this one may turn them off Agatha Christie who was a good mystery writer actually . Her mystery novels usually ends with the reader me in this case gasping and going Damn ! She 's good.This one did n't . Nuff said . ",1
"Cat Among the Pigeons is constructed a bit differently than most of Agatha Christie 's novels rather than a single primary setting where most if not all the action takes place with Hercule Poirot entering fairly early in the story this book veers back and forth between times and settings . It starts at Meadowbank a very exclusive English girl 's school . Then it reverses in time by a few months and moves to the fictional Middle Eastern country or city ? of Ramat where the crown prince entrusts his close English friend with his most prized possession not sure if he will make it out of his country alive due to the revolution that is taking place . Then the setting moves back to the English school again where we are told very early on that the handsome new young gardner is really a special forces agent working under disguise.The point of view often shifts also between the various characters and sometimes information is given via a newspaper article or a letter.It is not until near the end disc 5 of 6 that Hercule Poirot even enters the story when one of the students at the girls ' school goes to him after two murders have occurred at the school and after she had made an astounding discovery . Poirot remains a minor character whose sole role was his characteristic summing up at the end of the book where he always summons all of the characters into a room together and proceeds to tell them the solution to the mystery giving his stepbystep process . Which was very unlikely in this case since his lack of involvement meant he had to make astounding leaps of deduction which were quite unconvincing.This makes for a very disjointed novel and weakens Cat Among the Pigeons significantly . Which is a shame because as far as characterizations go it is one of Christie 's best with none of the silly characterizations or gimmicky plot elements that she sometimes put in her other books . As one other reviewer stated much more articulately than I can it is as though with this book Agatha Christie could n't settle on exactly what type of mystery she wanted to write.As usual Hugh Fraser 's narration is excellent . ",2
"It was a fun read . I watched the movie on PBS . I loved the book . It keeps a reader engaged . ",4
"Anyone who enjoys reading Christie will enjoy this . It has all the elements and attributes of a great thriller ! Of course Poirot is a master at getting to the solution through the use of his little grey cells ! I thoroughly enjoyed every part of the book ! ",4
"excellent read with very intricate and clever plot with the usual high quality standard you can get from Agatha Christie 's book . My only comment is that Poirot comes in to the story only very late about a bit more than halfway through the book but very good nevertheless ",4
"This is definitely one of Christies best novels right up there with Death Comes as the End And Then There Were None and Murder in Mesopotamia.Yeah ok she might not be a literary genius but she definitely has genius of a kind . She practically invented this type of detective novel i 'm not counting Conan Doyle . Why ? Because i hate his ludicrous novels using the brain whilst at the same time creating great character sketches.She does n't develop her characters loads but then that is NOT what her novels are about . they 're about enjoying a great puzzle . And boy can she construct a great puzzle ! The one here is probably the bestm in that is lacks Hercule Poirot for about the first three quarters some of her best books were those which were without Poirot or Marple . through that she was able to create a good psychological detective story then bring Poirot in at the end to tie it all up neatly and provide the solution.The climax is great and probably one of her best . I read this when i was about 12 and was not at all versed in the workins of a detective novel in that it is the least likely person who did it . I just enjoyed the read and was gladly surprised when i found out the identity of the culprit . No doubt those with mroe experience would have been able to spot the killer straight away . However this remains one of her best novels and one which i will enjoy reading again and again . ",4
"Agatha Christie choses an illustrious girl 's school as the setting to Poirot 's latest mystery though Poirot himself is not a major player in the proceedings appearing for the first time well over halfway through the book . Instead most of the action centers around the staff of Meadowbank School and its tone resembles that ofthe Tommy and Tuppence storiesconsidering its emphasis on espionage and international politics.Mrs Bulstrode rules over Meadowbank School with pride and competence having established it from virtually nothing many years ago with her college Miss Chadwick . The two women now run the most exclusive girl 's school in England though unbeknownst to them events are happening on the other side of the world that will have a huge effect on the school . When a cache of precious rubies goes missing from Ramat after an uprising against the monarchy special agents across the globe narrow their search down to Meadowbank School thanks to a link between the Sheikh of Ramat 's English pilot and a young student at the boarding school.Secret international forces converge on the school leading to a cloakanddagger mystery with plenty of secret identities buried secrets hidden jewels and of course murder most foul . When an unpopular teacher is found dead in the new Sports Pavilion the police are called in but none of them have any idea as to the purpose behind such a killing . Only one thing is certain that one of the school 's staff is involved the proverbial cat among the pigeons.Setting the story in a girl 's school was an enjoyable change of pace as Christie deftly paints the interrelations between a suspicious staff and the excited girls all with their own secrets opinions viewpoints and understanding of the world around them . Though the characters are not particularly welldrawn and a few are simply names on a page the atmosphere of a school is wellhandled and lends the book an added sense of danger considering the close proximity of so many innocent lives . In many ways this is a woman 's book given its emphasis on gossip blackmail mothers and the allure of jewels.Sometimes too many things like the jewels ' hiding place and the reason behind the focus on the school are telegraphed too early and as blasphemous as it may sound I felt that the gradual uncovering of revelations were better handled in therecent television adaptation starring David Suchet as well as being better paced in general thanks to Mark Gatiss 's screenplay.Cat Among the Pigeons is certainly not Christie 's best Poirot novel . Perhaps by this time she was running out of steam not to mention struggling with her welldocumented frustration with the fastidious little Belgian . Devoted Christie fans will want to finish Cat Among the Pigeons for the sake of completion but newcomers to Christie 's work may wish to start their reading experience elsewhere say withThe Mysterious Affair at StylesorThe Murder of Roger Ackroyd .

"There was a time when I would honestly read this book about every two months . I simply HAD to be reading Cat Among the Pigeons no matter what else I was reading at the time . I would alternate between two different Agatha Christies and this one and it actually lasted about a year ! That 's my testimonial to how absolutely perfect Cat Among the Pigeons is.And what makes this book so great and worth the money ? Well for one thing Agatha did a flawless job of capturing atmosphere in this book . Ramat does n't even exist I do n't think yet I could feel myself there feel the heat practically see the opulence of the unfortunate young prince 's palace and feel the current of danger and imminent disaster present in every Ramat scene . I have no idea how she did it because she was never one to give readers a lot of local flavor . And now here is Agatha Christie making us feel the heart of an IMAGINARY CITY ! The same goes for the girls ' school . I could clearly picture Meadowbank in my mind with its lazy afternoons and young students concerned more with boys and hiding places for cigarettes than the relationship between Iago Desdemona and Othello.The characters could reach out and tap you on the nose they are made so perfectly . There are no faceless plastic people in this novel not that there always are in other Christies . I 've often mentally applied Christie 's wonderful description of Ann Shapland 's hair to other people in my life hair that fitted her like a black satin cap . And even though there is n't much else to Julia Upjohn 's physical description besides having a freckled face like her mother she forms a distinct appearance in my mind because of Christie 's description of her personality . I do n't want to give too much away but I 'll say that she 's the kind of girl that Poirot would respect.And last but never least How is the actual 'mystery ' part ? Well as other reviewers have said you will have NO IDEA who 'did it . ' I can guarantee it . Truthfully . Honestly . You will pause for a second in that wonderful AgathaChristieStupor while it soaks into your head . So do n't worry about that part . Agatha did n't miss with this book . The shock effect for this one is one of the highest I 've actually ever felt higher than Death on the Nile and actually getting up there with Roger Ackroyd and Orient Express . I 'm serious ! That 's how surprising this mysterythriller is.To sum it all up The atmosphere is great the characters are great the mystery is perfect and oh yes ! I nearly forgot ! The thrill factor is VERY high ! There is one particular scene toward the end it involves a chair that 's all I 'll say that will make you AT LEAST a little paranoid that there is someone watching you . Very creepy and very well done . That happens many times throughout this book.Cat Among the Pigeons is one of the best . To be fair it is THE best of all the mysterythrillers . Buy it and enjoy it !

"An English pilot for a Middle Eastern ruling prince just managed to hide a fabulous fortune in gems somewhere in his sister 's room just before the prince was overthrown in a revolution . The unsuspecting sister returned to England with her daughter just in time for the girl to start in Meadowbanks an & eacutelite girls school where a female cousin & fiance of the deposed prince was also arranged to attend.Several interested parties had been on the prowl searching for the gems the pilot 's efforts had not been as clandestine as he had hoped . With new girls new teachers and also a new young handsome male gardener was it a wonder that some residents of Meadowbanks felt as if there was a hidden cat among the pigeons.Agatha Christie painted an excellent picture of an English public school going about its daily business . There were staff as well as students who were trying to get use to a new environment . There was a headmistress who having successfully established the school according to her vision after years of struggle was considering passing the torch to the next generation . There were old faithfuls among the staff who were less prominent but had heard and seen much of what others missed.Meadowbanks was probably Agatha Christie 's of what an ideal school should be like.Having got the background set Agatha Christie got down to business with the first murder the victim being a rather unpopular new staff in the recently completed Sports Pavilion . Readers would have been given enough outright hints before this as to what would be of interest in the Sports Pavilion . The object of the mystery quickly turned from recovery of the gems to the discovery of the murderer.Midway a second murder almost threw the investigators offtrack and a third murder was committed before Hercule Poirot who was called in late in the game seriously got down to business.Mystery readers could find little fault in way which the authorities set about trying to find the culprit but it took bringing back a student 's mother from Anatolia to trap the murderer.All the while Christie managed to maintain a light hearted atmosphere despite the deaths in the story with occassional injection of humour and wit . She included important and interesting roles for the diverse characters from students to faculty to police to parents in how the mystery was played out . This is truly one of her most readable book .

"I absolutly loved this book . Although Hercule Poirot does n't come in untill closer to the end of the book this is in my oppinion one of the best Agatha Cristie 's and it will keep you guessing to the last page . ",4
"First let me say that Hugh Fraser does his usual great job narrating this book . If you 've listened to any of the other audio books he 's done in this series you know what I mean . If you have n't well pick one and give it a try.Now the story is a decent one with lots of Christie craftsmanship . If you 're used to Hercule Poirot from the popular BBCPBSA & E video series starting David Suchet you may be a little surprised by this story . Yes yes all his personality is there and Fraser does his voice well . The surprise is that at least 80 % of the story develops before Poirot shows up to solve it.Again absolutely fine as a mystery tale . It 's just a bit limited on the famous Poirot mannerisms due to the way the story is constructed.Update Since I wrote this review I saw the new David Suchet version of this on PBS . As expected the video version turned things around a bit and featured Poirot more prominently from the start . You will not find that to be the case in this audio book . ",3
"Once again Alister MacLean has woven a story that kept me riveted to my chair . I could not put the book down until I had read it through . MacLean was an extremely good story teller and he managed to do this without the use of sex and foul language . Quite a feat in this world today . Be warned though if you have n't the time to read a book from cover to cover in a sitting then do not pick this one up . It is truly riveting . ",4
"Alistair Maclean was a literary force of nature who influenced whole generations of thriller writers with his gripping stories exotic settings and timely plots . Maclean covered most of the major militaryadventure thriller plots decades before Cussler and Clancy in a more elegant and believable way . Maclean did n't waste words on gratuitous sex technobabble or political ramblingshis stories are all plot action and suspense.The Golden Rendezvous combines a high seas murder mystery piracy and nuclear terrorism in a gripping narrative that really goes into overdrive around the middle of the book . In typical Maclean fashion the protagonist has to overcome impossible odds physical hardships the forces of nature and the treachery of people around him to prevail . There are several trademark plot twists that keep the story from becoming predictable and the shipboard setting is very vividly described by the former navy man . While the novel may seem somewhat dated to modern readers the plotting and narrative intensity are as good as anything our current thriller writers could hope for . 4.5 stars ! ",3
"Famed storyteller Alistair Maclean wrote The Golden Rendezvous as far back as 1962 but this suspenseful high seas adventure story holds up remarkably well . The plot concerns the S.S. Campari a cargo ship converted into a highly selective passenger liner to carry millionaires around the Caribbean . A series of murders onboard bring out the detective in the Campari 's First Officer Johnny Carter who soon uncovers a complicated plot involving a stolen nuclear device a bankrupt Caribbean dictator and a shipment of gold . As a criminal gang takes over the ship Carter must somehow uncover the last details of the plot in order to save the crew and passengers . In typical Maclean fashion the ending includes a series of plot twists and heoric deeds by First Officer Carter.Maclean 's experience as a sailor informs his descriptions of life at sea aboard the Campari . Similarly his sketches of the principal members of the crew ring true . His villians look to this Cold War veteran like nasty Cuban agents of Fidel Castro but this may be transparent to younger readers . Johnny Carter 's heroic feats in rescuing the ship approach the improbable but the wise reader will let it ride in order to enjoy the story . Maclean 's dialogue is typically crisp and sardonic Carter 's relationship with the young beautiful and surprising daughter of a multimillionaire adds some nice depth to the story.This novel is highly recommended to fans of Alistair Maclean and to readers looking for an entertaining story .

"Alistair MacLean one of the premier adventure storywriters is at his best when writing firstperson narratives that put his protagonists in perilous situations and then push them to the limits of physical emotional and psychological endurance . His early novels are exciting full of cliffhanging situations and rife with clever detection in the classical sense MacLean plays by the classical detective rules placing all of the clues in front of the reader and at his most cunning daring the reader to figure out who the criminal mastermind is.But the detection and the undertones of espionage are superficial elements used to keep the narrative moving briskly along between action set pieces that pit the protagonist against impossible odds and very often against the severest imaginable environmental extremes . By these standards The Golden Rendezvous is one of his better books.It is an excellent blend of mystery suspense clever bluffs and double bluffs selfdeprecating wit action and our protagonist 's determined efforts to overcome painful injuries and antagonistic environmental extremes.A luxury cruise ship is hijacked at sea by a master criminal whose intention is not a simple ransoming of the wealthy hostages on board . Exactly what his goal is forms part of the mystery that is left for our hero the injured First Officer of the ship John Carter to ferret out . And to undermine.The Golden Rendezvous finds MacLean at neartop form . The book does not have quite the verve of The Satan Bug The Dark Crusader or When Eight Bells Toll but it comes close . Which at the high level that MacLean delivers excitement and pageturning suspense makes for outstanding adventure story reading . ",3
"All of his books are great . especially his earlier ones . toward the end of his carreer they dropped a bit . but most of them are fantastic . I read mostly all of his books . ",4
"Warning SPOILERS ! ! ! ! I do n't know what it is about The Golden Rendevous that sticks in my head . Like many of MacLean 's stories it 's written in the firstperson which lends a sense of urgency to the impossible situations the hero finds himself in . Like many of the stories there 's a beautiful girl who is n't just a damsel in distress but lends crucial help to the hero . He just would n't make it without her . And like many of the stories the bad guy is just thata bad guy with no redeeming qualities . No confusion with MacLeanyou know who you 're supposed to root for and who you 're supposed to detest not many pages in . I suppose it 's the humanity that he manages to infuse into his characters that gets me . The Golden Rendevous has some particularly appealing characters.The plot is not very involveda seemingly innocent passenger on the Campari is planning to use the cruise ship to pirate a ship carrying gold . He 's brought along a kidnapped scientist and a stolen nuclear device to blow up the gold ship after he gets the cargo . And he 's planned everything down to the last detail not realizing that a member of the crew First Officer John Carter has figured out his plan and will do everything he can to stop him . It 's a tense ride with gunfights knife fights and suicidal stunts aboard the most luxurious cruise ship in the world . The Campari is a character in itselfan incredibly opulent boat with prices even the fabulously wealthy can barely afford . How this book failed to make it to the big screen is a mystery to methe sets alone would have made it a movie worth seeing.MacLean 's heros are always likeable and John Carter is no exception . However he is not just likeablehe has some scenes that have never failed to get me . Like when he tells Miss Susan Beresford spoiled multimillionaire that her kind make him sick when they misuse their power to taunt the crew members who desperately need their jobs . Or when he sees the atomic bomb central to the plot for the first time and backs up to where it 's not visible reasoning that he 's safe if he ca n't see it poking fun at himself . When Carter helps the bad guy plan how to take the gold ship he 's planning to pirate and tells his friends he has no family only himself and has to look after all he has in the world he does n't dare tell them what 's really going on I always feel for himthey 're so mad at him . And at the end when he pops up and reveals all his clever tricks to save the gold and the scientist and get the bad guy I always feel like cheering . ",4
"Alistair Macean is my favourite thriller writer.Golden Rendouvous is a bonafide classic.Just reading this book reveals what a great plotter Maclean was and he always knew how to combine action suspense and he did n't need to write 500 or 10000 pages unlike the new writers of today.He had a sense of humour as well and i always thought his characters were colourful.Alsothough Maclean did his research thorougly his books were never bogged down in details unlike many authors today.Golden Rendevous is a must read ! go and read it and make your day !

"Alistair MacLean was one of the best adventure writers of all time . He does it all on the strength of plot style and characterization are nearly nonexistent but they are n't the reason you read MacLean books . I dare say that virtually every major adventure plot is covered in one of his novels and his influence is such that subsequent authors have paid homage to scenes of his . For example there 's a scene in Clive Cussler 's The Mediterranean Caper that 's a virtual reprise of a scene from The Secret Ways.The Golden Rendezvous is a classic ocean hijacking story where the hero is the ship 's First Officer John Carter . The ship is a converted ocean liner full of guests some mysterious and carrying some secret cargo . During the cruise the ship gets hijacked by some violent but devious criminals . Some of the ship 's officers are killed and others including Carter are wounded . Still Carter attempts to stop the hijackers . . . .This is one of the best MacLean novels written in the 1960s along with a stellar run that includes The Satan Bug Where Eagles Dare Puppet on a Chain and The Guns of Navarone . Most of those were turned into movies and in the 1970s Hollywood adapted The Golden Rendezvous into a soso Richard Harris movie titled Nuclear Terror . ",4
"This was another new Agatha Christie novel I had never read or even heard of . It was a really fun read and definitely offered a slightly different twist from the typical Agatha Christie novel . I really enjoyed it and love that it 's available on Kindle . ",4
"I was intrigued by this case and I had some idea of who the killer or killers were by the end . It is definitely one of the classic Poirot mysteries . ",3
"Twenty years before this novel opens a tragic doubledeath has occurred . Alistair Ravenscroft and his wife Margaret were found shot to death near their home . The deaths were declared suicides at the time . Now years later their daughter Celia is engaged to be married . Her future motherinlaw wants to know more about the cirumstances of the death and if the wife killed the husband or the husband killed the wife . She does not want some inherited proclivity to murder to affect her son . Celia turns to her godmother Ariadne Oliver who once again enlists the help of her old friend Hercule Poirot . Together they track down a list of elephants people with long memories who never forget past events . The officer who had been in charge of the case a wig stylist two French governesses and a family friend each remember some piece of information that Poirot can collect and assemble as he uncovers secrets long buried and brings the truth to light.This is Mrs. Oliver 's final appearance in a Christie novel and also the last Poirot book Agatha Christie wrote although readers will see him again in Curtain which she wrote during the 1940 's but was not published until 1975 .

"The intermix of farce with facts small town minds & traditions of rural England was a fun mix to wade through along with the facts as stated . ",4
"Dame Agatha Christie 's penultimate Hercule Poirot murder mystery is Elephants Can Remember . The 224 page book was published in 1971 . The story includes Poirot 's friend the mystery author Ariadne Oliver who bears a close resemblance to Agatha Christie.The book is narrated in the third person . It is always delicious fun when Poirot and Oliver join wits to defeat crime ! Plot Ariadne Oliver the famous crime novelist is attending a literary party . She meets the obesely odious Mrs BurtonCox . This grand dame informs Ariadne that her stepson Desmond is planning to wed Cecilia Ravenscroft . Desmond is the son of Kathleen Fee who was the mistress of Mrs. BurtonCox 's first husband . Fee was a wealthy actress who has died leaving a large fortune to DesmondBurtonCox wants Ariadne to investigate Celia ' background . It is believed that Miss Ravencroft 's parents committed suicide . Another theory is that Celia 's father Sir Alistair Ravenscroft killed his much younger wife Molly or she murdered him . The murderer was then believed to have killed himherself The unsolved case occurred some fifteen years prior to the novel 's action.Ariadne refers to persons who worked or were otherwise acquainted with the deceased Ravenscroft couple as old elephants . This is because Oliver hopes those she interviews have good memories like elephants ! Ariadne and her friend Hercule Poirot visit these characters hoping to learn more details about the murdersuicide . We learn of the romantic triangle involving Sir Ravenscroft and the twin sisters Molly and Dolly . Dolly has spent time in a mental institution . She was living with her sister and Sir Alistair at the time of the tragic deaths . Dolly is thought to have murdered a child in India as well as her son . Four wigs and a dog bite will clarify the crime.Though a very late Hercule Poirot novel I thought this entry in the Christie canon provides a good read . It is not one of her greatest mysteries but is a good solid read . Well done Dame Agatha ! ",3
"This a good story that was not properly edited before it was released for publication . Someone may know the circumstances around the time of its release who could shed some light on it . Christie has shown some undue repetition in her books over the years seeming to overly repeat points and perhaps would have done it more without some editing . Apparently there was little to none done here and that aspect almost ruins this book . She had the story outline in hand good characters and playing out but the relating of it was fraught with overthetop redundancy . Besides that some of the writing is actually trite and sophomorically mechanical . It 's as if she was besieged with tasks at the time had to meet the publication date and just shoved it to her publishers without time for them to work on it . Or she had someone write it or parts of it with her notes and it just went out the door that way.The story harkens back to others similar in theme that of digging up past events and involved parties to resolve an old issue the police could not at the time . They are done to bring closure to innocent parties on the threshold of their adult lives and succeeded in doing that . However each time the interesting circumstances and persons involved created a fresh story with its own uniqueness.Again this is a good tale poorly told . I think you would have to have read a lot of Agatha Christie and maybe those other similar works to wade through knowing she would deliver a good resolution . However the writing is way below the standards I have ever experienced under her name and would not have thought her capable of such a poor job . There are very amateurishly written portions some meaningless sentences and a problem with flow that it would seem impossible for Ms. Christie to have written . A good disciplined writer familiar with her works and her style could fix it . It would take a lot of work . There would have to be some cuts rewriting of the transitional flow and almost all the dialogue redone . This was obviously a rushed job. ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ",2
"Definitely one of my least favorite Poirot books . As other reviewers have mentioned the solution to this mystery is quite apparent about halfway through the novel . I sort of wanted to shake Mrs. Oliver and Poirot and ask them how they could be so obtuse and not realize the solution . The quirks our beloved Poirot typically display are all gone here all that is left is rather dry prose and a mystery that should have been shortened by about sixty pages . Having said all of that it does make for a quick read that does not require much thinking . If you are looking for a great example of a murderinretrospect book by Christie I would recommend Five Little Pigs instead . ",2
"Agatha Christies books are filled with little details that just cause her characters to endear themselves to you . This novel of hers was a great mystery to read but it also gives us more insight to the Poirot the man and not just the detective.I heartily recommend this book and the entire series to anyone who loves a great mystery well written ! ",4
"I feel really bad saying this because the poor woman was 81 and had Alzheimer 's when she wrote it but this book is horrible . No plot development no mystery tedious and predictable . I did n't read any of the reviews before I bought it because I was afraid of spoilers and because as a die hard fan I had trust in Christie 's work . But I had no idea this was her final book or that her mind was so far gone by the time she wrote it . I feel bad for her . She is truly a classic and one of my favorite writers of all time . But I really wish I had skipped this one and I recommend you do too . ",0
"Great bookI bought this book on tape by John Moffatt no ! not BY him but read by him . This book proves a theory though there 's a significant change in Mrs. Christies writing over the years the nice young lady who writes wellpuzzled crafted formula tothepoint murder mystery and the old lady who 's slightly bitter to the modern world but writes more real and cozy books about peoples lives . More relaxed and less upthight books . This book falls into the latter category . That does n't mean it ' a bad book nono ! It 's good but different from earlier works . The later books seem to be more relaxed and more about looking back and viewing things from a distance about great characters tellingnot actinggreat stories ! This book really has a realistic ring to it it has good funny characters . It 's not as British murder mystery as some of her other work but more real somehow.PS . Those of you who did n't like the book get a hold of John Moffatt 's reading he 's great ! Really makes the characters come alive ! ! ",3
"I love that I can picture David Suchet as Hercule he has his own kind of sexy Agatha still keeps us guessing . Love it ! ",3
"This must be the worst Agatha Christie book ever . It 's her very last Hercule Poirot novel and one can see that the writer is very old by now 82 . There is no freshness left in her prose it is stale predictable corny and generally trashy . As other reviewers have said the material contained here would barely be enough to sustain a short story . To make a fulllength novel out of this really is ridiculous . The book fails at what normally is Agatha Christie 's greatest strength the plot and the denouement . With dozens of pages left to go the reader knows the solution ! Unheard of in the world of Christie if for nothing else then for this the novel can not be rated higher than 1 star . However the characters and dialogs are boring and clicheridden as well so the book has no redeeming qualities either . Nothing ever happens on the 200 pages of this book no crime no mystery no real conflict among characters it 's all just endlessly boring talk talk and nothing but talk about the past . The only interesting thing perhaps is to contemplate the autobiographical hints Christie gives us in describing one of the novel 's detectives Ariadne Oliver a mystery writer . But these hints are only interesting because they throw light on our favourite writer Agatha Christie they are not interesting in themselves and therefore do not improve the book 's literary quality . It was excruciating to have to wade through the turgid prose of this book this title can not be recommended to anyone except extreme Christie enthusiasts . ",0
"Celia Ravenscroft is but a little girl when both her parents commit suicide . Never did she worry about the real reasons for that dramatic event until today when she stands on the verge of getting married to Desmond BurtonCox . Only one question suddenly seems of importance Who killed whom Celia 's father or mother ? Reason enough for Ariadne Oliver Celia 's godmother to pay a visit to her old friend Hercule Poirot . The famous sleuth persuades Mrs. Oliver to delve with his guidance of course into the past to find the persons who are like elephants the persons who will still remember the important details about this allbutforgotten tragedy.Elephants Can Remember is Agatha Christie 's next to last work of detection and the author shows clearly signs of age which is understandable since she was eightytwo years old and in failing health.Elephants Can Remember is a murder in retrospect mystery . Although Christie has proven to fully master this format see Sparkling Cyanide and Five Little Pigs she now quickly looses touch with the story . She is forced to sow the narrative together with vague memories of a series of old spinsters and suddenly even events that should easily be remembered are covered by the veil of forgetfulness . No surprise that the plot is total confusion . It is less a mystery than a scrapbook of memories . Action is less important than atmosphere which makes the story quite tedious and difficult to hang on to . Nevertheless the experienced reader will figure out the solution to this not too mysterious mystery halfway through the book . ",2
"I found this late Agatha Christie novel disappointing compared to most of her earlier works . The plot line involves a murder mystery that happened in the past . Much of the novel is devoted to unraveling what happened through conversations with various people who knew the people involved . There is so much repetitiveness as the chatty Ms Oliver talks to all those people hashes things out in her mind then tells Poirot what she was told then he hashes things in his own mind then he tells others Uh ! The same fact or theory is repeated in many places to the point of insulting the reader 's intelligence . This is so unlike Christie where every word had its purpose . Perhaps one better think of this novel as a study of human memory . Overall I give it 2.5 stars . ",2
"I have read lot of Christie and I found this book to be slower than most . It as also les interesting in that I guessed the ending which I usually do n't do . As Christie books go I wold call this one second shelf . ",2

"Detective novelist and Christie alter ego Ariadne Oliver has been coaxed into attending a literary party something she like Christie did not enjoy and avoided whenever possible . Mrs. Oliver 's experience at this one would ensure that it would be a long time before she attended another . An overbearing woman Mrs. BurtonCox manages to corner the author cross examine her about her goddaughter one of many Mrs. Oliver has managed to acquire through the years . And now that the young woman Celia is quite grown up one with which Mrs. Oliver has quite lost touch . It seems that Celia and Mrs. BurtonCox 's son are engaged or will soon be and Mrs. BurtonCox wants to know if Celia 's mother killed her father or did her father kill her mother . Mrs. Oliver was quite shocked by the rudeness of the encounter and troubled about what to do about it so she contacted her friend Hercule Poirot for guidance in the matter . Soon the pair each in their own unique way begin to tackle the problems reestablishing contact with Celia investigating the old tragedy and finding out just why Mrs. BurtonCox is so insistance on knowing the answer.For fans of Ariadne Oliver this is a particular treat giving the reader more information into her and perhaps Christie 's personal life than any previous stories . It is interesting to see Oliver 's and Poirot 's different approaches to investigation even to the point of different interpretations of what the actual problem is.This is not the cleverest mystery that Christie ever wrote nor even the best written but it is a very enjoyable one none the less and is a definite must read for any Poirot or Oliver fan .

"I enjoyed this book very much . It was well written . The plot the people all were well written . I read it in about two days . It flowed and was not hard to read . I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking a good mystery . ",4
"I read this book at 19 and discovered the delightful character of Ariadne Oliver the witty self deprecating and charming self portrait of Christie herself . Indeed I was so taken with Ariadne that I continued to read Christie in search of her . But while this story includes much of what is best of Christie a very readable engaging mystery with young love a certain tragic nobleness and of course some whimsy and humor it is a little too tragic and even somewhat laboriously worked out in the end . A good Christie mystery but not one of her top ten ",3
"Elephants Can Remember is Dame Christie 's last Poiret fulllength story according to most sources and written when the author was clearly playing the back nine . This is one of the few detective novels that even I could figure out who had done it and most of the methods long before the Belgian detective assembled the remaining characters at the scene of the crime.Some will say this is Christie 's weakest product . I have not read them all so I will not make that judgement but it clearly suffers from a worn out plot and formulaic proceedings . We all know that elephants are claimed in nursery rhymes to never forget but this seems to be a revelation to Poiret and the aging writer Miss Oliver . As Christie 's alterego Miss Oliver is suffering the foibles of age including total inability to recall anything or anyone and stress over shortcomings in one 's career such as writer 's block and fear of crowds and public speaking.In a clever construct both Poiret and Miss Oliver set out simultaneously to determine the relevant facts in a decadeold case of murder suicide or accidental death . Poiret warns all at the onset that nothing good will come from this painstaking reenactment but it seems there are always some things that daughters and odious inlaws need to know . Unfortunately for Miss Christie 's reputation she relies on a tired method of including twins in the mix so we all can see where this is going especially when it becomes clear that the late husband had been in love with both twins . ",3
"Poignant story contains more dialogue than action but does have one of Christie 's best twist endings which is also a real heartbreaker . Poirot and Adriane Oliver try to discover who killed who in a murder suicide and find out that the tragedy never really went away . A really good story for readers who like to listen to characters speak and recall their history . Plot seeking others might want to delve into Agatha 's more exciting yarns for suspense . This one is mostly about the power of memory . I found it touching and quite involving . ",3
"I know Christie was pretty old when she wrote this book so it pains me to be so negative but her age really does show . The story is n't interesting the mystery is n't mysterious and the characters are paperthin even Poirot seems like a shadow of his usual self . The exception is Ariadne Oliver who gets a remarkable amount of development for someone who ostensibly is just a side character . This is her final appearance in a Poirot mystery and she gets an excellent sendoff . The same can not be said for Poirot . This is the final Poirot novel that Christie wrote though not the final one that was published since she wrote his real finale years earlier and set it aside to be published after her death . I have n't read it yet because I can not bear to so I 'm saving it to be the last new Christie book I ever read . I just hope it 's superior to this one ! In this one Poirot and Mrs. Oliver are trying to figure out what happened to the parents of one of Mrs. Oliver 's god children . They were found shot to death in the woods but what happened ? Did the father shoot the mother or vice versa ? Was it a suicide pact ? Mrs. Oliver is asked to investigate by a woman she meets at a luncheon then proceeds to go about interviewing a lot of people she has n't seen in many years to ask questions about what was happening in the family to try and put the pieces together with Poirot who is busy talking to the police . It 's quite similar toFive Little Pigs Also published as Murder In Retrospect another Poirot murder in retrospect . The difference is that you 'll be able to spot the solution to this one miles off as I was . I can now say that about only three of her books Peril at End House A Hercule Poirot Mystery Agatha Christie CollectionandThe Mirror Crack 'd Miss Marple Mysteriesbeing the other two and sadly it does n't make for a very interesting read . More annoying still is that in this book a character writes to Poirot and tells him that in order to solve the mystery he should find and interview person X because she might be able to help them with the truth . And so after pages and pages of wasted time Poirot finds and interviews X and she KNOWS THE ENTIRE EXPLANATION TO THE MYSTERY . She is flown to England she tells her story and then the mystery is solved . So tell me again why Poirot and Mrs. Oliver were even needed ? ! That guy could 've talked to this character himself anytime he liked ! Christie also employs a method I 've seen her resort to in just one other book she has Poirot the master detective . . . hire a detective ! In lieu of actually writing plot development she settles for pages of exposition as a man shows up and tells Poirot all the details he needs to know about a specific character . And she later turns out to have no bearing on the mystery whatsoever so the entire interlude was a colossal waste of time . Normally I 'd decry this as a lazy author 's way to get out of writing an additional chapter of action but in Christie 's case I 'm charitable enough to substitute the word lazy with the word elderly which makes the choice understandable if not forgivable.On the whole I have to admit that I would n't even recommend this book to a diehard Christie fan . But if you 're dead set and determined to read everything she ever wrote then go for it . I am too so I can sympathize . Just be prepared to be bored and let down big time by this one . It 's just not up to Christie 's usual standards . Luckily she wrote enough phenomenal classic stories to be sure that her legacy would remain in tact regardless of what she published and all Christie newbies can rest assured it gets a heck of a lot better than this .

"Hercule Poirot 's friend Mrs. Oliver has so many godchildren that she has lost track of them and she has not thought of her god daughter Celia Ravenscroft for many years . She receives a visit from Mrs. BurtonCox a woman whose son wishes to marry Celia . She has a strange requestthat Mrs. Oliver find out whether Celia 's mother killed her father or vice versa . She does not reveal her reasons for wanting this information but her request sends Mrs. Oliver right to Poirot who does much of the sleuthing for her . The two friends take separate paths in order to interview as many people as possible who can remember things from the Ravenscrofts ' past . Mrs. Oliver dubs the witnesses as elephants people who will not forget important details which may help them solve the case . The mystery in this particular novel is not as difficult for the reader to unravel as it is in most of Christie 's books and that spoiled the fun for me a bit . Uncharacteristically the author reveals too many clues too early in the book but it still is worth reading . ",2

"Elephants Can Remember was one of Agatha Christie 's last mysteries in terms of rating I would rank it as slightly below satisfactory . While it is far from her best it is not quite among her very worst either.The weaknesses of Elephants Can Remember are several . First there is a marked lack of action of any kind . Elephants Can Remember is concerned with an investigation into deaths that happened entirely in the past . Therefore the whole book consists of conversations . There is never any danger or threat to anyone living so there is no element of excitement as in most of Christie 's other books.The second weakness that I would point out is that the solution of the mystery as it were becomes fairly apparent to the reader about midway through the rest of the time is spent waiting for Hercule Poirot 's amazing gray cells to figure it out and catch up to what the readerlistener already knows . The third weakness is that the solution to the mystery involved actions that I found entirely unbelievable . I wo n't expand any further than that so as to not spoil the story for anyone who has n't yet read it but Christie had a couple of characters behave in ways that were quite reprehensible but that is never called into question . Her explanation for it as it were does n't hold water.The only really excellent thing about this book is the narration . ",1
"Dame Agatha Christie wrote more than eight dozen mysteries in her lengthy lifetime and Elephants Can Remember is nearly one of the last . But the old girl had lost none of her charm or wit in a novel that came more than 50 years after her firstThe Mysterious Affair at Styles.An interfering busybody monopolizes the mystery author Ariadne Oliver a delicious sendup Christie created of herself at a literary luncheon about a 15yearold tragedy in which an old schoolmate of Mrs. Oliver 's and her husband died in what police presumed was a suicide pact . At the time of the tragedy Mrs. Oliver had been on a book tour in America so she had garnered what little information she had secondhand . But the longago deaths begin to trouble Mrs. Oliver . With the help of her old friend detective Hercule Poirot Mrs. Oliver begins to consult the elephants that is older people who like elephants can still remember what happened decades ago.Elephants Can Remember provides a delightful puzzle for readers to unravel and better yet a glimpse into the remarkably romantic Papa Poirot who is so often eager to bring starcrossed lovers together e.g.The Murder on the Links A Hercule Poirot Mystery Hercule Poirot MysteriesSad Cypress The Arcadian Deer and The Horses of Diomedes inThe Labours of Hercules 12 Hercule Poirot Mysteries . Highly recommended . ",4
"No wonder Christie is known as the queen of mystery . I have read all her books and Poirot is my favorite character . She always leads the reader into the suspenseful conclusion in such a delightful and surprising methods . Excellent reading as always . ",4
"I am on an Agatha Christie run right now . This book is a Hercule Poirot mystery . This is a story of a womanMrs . Ariadne Oliver that is approached while at a literary luncheon by some one unknown to her Mrs. BurtonCox about Mrs. Oliver 's goddaughter 's parents deaths fifteen years earlier . Mrs. BurtonCox is curious to learn the truth about the murdersuicide of Celia Ravenscroft 's parents.This was a different type of mystery that was interesting to follow . You already know who the victims are you are just trying to learn who was killed first . Who was the actual person to murder and then commit suicide . Mrs. BurtonCox is concerned because her son and Celia are planning to get married . She does n't want her son marrying some one who may decide to kill her son . As the story progresses you start to feel that there is an underlying reason for Mrs. BurtonCox 's true concerns . ",3
"I ca n't say that I have not loved any of Agatha Christie 's books and Elephants Can Remember is no exception.A very bossy woman Mrs BourtanCox confronts Mrs Ariadne Oliver a famous detective fiction novelist at a literary event and asks her the mysterious question ` Did her mother kill her father or was it the father who killed the mother ? 'The question is in retrospect of two deaths that occurred fifteen years ago of General and Lady Ravenscroft . Both shot dead but were they murdered ? Who killed who ? Was it a suicide pact ? A crime of passion ? Or A cold blooded murder ? The police had left an open verdict and now Mrs Oliver decides to take the help of her friend Hercule Poirot and solve this cold case . The case is old and the trail has gone cold with no witnesses apparent but as they delve into the past they discover that 'Old sins leave long shadows ' and that people like elephants can remember ! Every time I read an Agatha Christie novel I am wowed and each time I feel like asking her 'How did you think about this ? 'The mysteries that she thinks of and executes in her books are fantastic and work of genius . In this book also Christie displays an in depth knowledge of human nature and delivers a mystery which is unique baffling and which leaves a haunting effect on us.This book Elephants Can Remember one of the last written by Agatha Christie is as sharp and captivating as its predecessors . Mrs Ariadne Oliver 's character seems close to Christie and it seems like she is baring herself to her readers through this character . Poirot is showcased in a supporting role as compared to Ariadne Oliver which is interesting to note given his habit of self importance and his pride . The story is sad and Christie challenges the reader to solve it by not having many people to pin the murders on . But still one is unable to clear the mist of the mystery till the end ! I give this a full 5 on 5 for being splendidly written the challenge of not having many suspects a twisted crime that leaves us both sad and amazed at the levels of complexity of human nature and a story where there is love sacrifice caring jealousy execution hopelessness sadness unhappiness mysteries and finally truth and peace.This review is also available on njkinny.blogspot.in ",4
"I gave this book a 5 star rating because of the collaboration between Hercule Poirot and his colleague the famed mystery novelist . It was great fun to see Poirot and his friend untangle the web of crime and finally solve the case ! ! ",4
"It is quite obvious early on in this book that the author was advanced in years . The math is off so badly and so often whenever the subject of years comes up how many years ago did it happen ? How old is soandso now ? etc . Also the only character who remains essentially himself is Poirot pretty much Ariadne Oliver though only supposedly middleaged here is more muddled than most eightyyearolds I know . Even the victims ' ages 60 and 35 ? Pretty unusual that . If the wifevictim were only 35 why was she so worried about her advancing age ? So if the reader can get past all the muddle it is still an entertaining read IF as I say the reader is a diehard fan . I am so it was worth it to me.PARTIAL SPOILER ALERT Christie 's denouement of the crime is about as unrealistic as it can get . She really hearkens back to very early Christie in her inability to understand much less handle romantic love in any sort of realistic manner . ",2
"REVIEW Not exactly the best book to start with if you 're curious about Christie and her expertly crafted wildly plotted crime novels . Still ELEPHANTS CAN REMEMBER does have its charms and its moments of glory . The story concerns the murdersuicide of General Ravenscroft and his wife Margaret on a lonely cliffside at their house in Cornwall some twentyodd years before the book 's opening scene . Famed mystery novelist Ariadne Oliver Christie 's alterego is approached at a literary luncheon by the overbearing presence of a Mrs. BurtonCox who wants her to find out the truth behind the tragedy as it involves Mrs. Oliver 's goddaughter Celia Ravenscroft who just so happens to be engaged to Mrs. BurtonCox 's son Desmond . The reason why she wants the whole affair dug up is puzzling to Mrs. Oliver and so she pays a visit to her old friend M. Hercule Poirot who though at first reluctant decides to help Ariadne uncover the truth about the deaths . The solution to the killings is sound if trite yet no where near as intriguing as Christie 's other murder in retrospect cases . On top of that the book rambles on too much and is too leisurely paced for a lengthy novel as a short story it might have had more success . Still it 's hard to dismiss ELEPHANTS as an allout failure . It is flawed yet engaging and the sheer joy of reading along with such wonderful characters as Ariadne and Poirot makes it all worthwhile . Alas there is an excuse for Dame Agatha 's slightly below par performance after all the woman was eighttwoyearsold and in diminishing health when the book was written . ",1
"Elephants Can Remember does not read like a typical Hercule Poirot mystery . Agatha Christie 's famed detective is drawn into an old case by his friend the amateur sleuth and mystery writer Ariadne Oliver . The case involves what was apparently the double suicide of a loving husband and wife and the concern that these past actions might have left a horrible impact upon their children.The story switches between the findings of Ariadne Oliver and Hercule Poirot as they each go in search of 'elephants ' who might remember what happened around the time of the accident because after all an elephant never forgets . While there is no definite evidence as to what happened there are those who have never accepted the double suicide theory because they could n't answer the question why . But with Poirot and Mrs. Oliver working together a longunspoken truth is certain to be uncovered.Elephants Can Remember is classic Agatha Christie in terms of mystery . It 's central mystery has a unique if perhaps a little predictable twist the denouement of which is quite evenly paced and satisfactory . However this might be one novel where the time period of the plot is more glaring than others . The prose is heavyhanded at times and one does get a little sick of all the mentions of 'elephants ' . The characters are borderline twodimensional and therefore the reader does not care about them even if they are still interested in the mystery at hand . ",3
"It was with a certain sense of sadness that I read Elephants Can Remember knowing that it was the last book Agatha Christie ever wrote that featured the beloved characters of Hercule Poirot and Ariadne Oliver . Of course there isCurtain which stars Poirot and takes us to the end of his career as a detective but this had been written several years prior in order to give Poirot a proper sendoff and published after Christie 's death.So this for all intents and purposes is one of the last Poirot mysteries and certainly the last appearance of Ariadne Oliver the mystery novelist that Christie often used as a selfinsert to convey her own experiences and frustrations as an author . These would range from Ariadne 's irritation with her literary protagonist as Christie similarly held toward Poirot to her habit of eating apples while she worked to her bemusement at certain readers who would write to her in order to point out her mistakes . Here she expresses her awkwardness concerning fans that gush excessively over her work.At a literary lunch Ariadne is approached by a compete stranger and asked a question about a godchild she has n't seen in years . The woman who introduces herself as Mrs BurtonCox asked Ariadne an incredibly personal question concerning her goddaughter Celia Ravenscroft 's deceased parents was it Celia 's mother who killed her father or Celia 's father who killed her mother ? It takes a while for Ariadne to remember the circumstances that she 's referring to but finally recalls that Alistair and Margaret Ravenscroft were found shot dead near their house in such a way that made it impossible for the police to tell whether it was a double suicide or a murdersuicide.Ariadne discovers that Mrs BurtonCox 's son is engaged to be married to Celia Ravenscroft and suspects that his mother is trying to form a wedge between the two of them by insinuating that Celia may have inherited murderous impulses from one of her parents . But Ariadne seeks out her goddaughter 's permission to investigate the deaths further and wanting to know more about her parents ' demise Celia agrees . Naturally it is to Hercule Poirot that Ariadne turns and together the two of them go on the hunt for elephants.The witnesses are all elderly now and it all happened so long ago but Ariadne has faith in the elephants of the old saying and Poirot agrees believing that even little details and false assumptions may prove valuable . Together the two of them try to piece together the mystery of the past in a book that relies heavily on oral testimony and the memories of those present.As a book written near the end of Christie 's life it 's clear that she 's slowing down . Elephants Can Remember has a few recycled concepts several flat characters and is one of only two of her books thus far in which I 've been able to guess the conclusion far in advance . And trust me if I can guess it anyone can ! There are lots of meandering speeches some inconsistencies regarding the timeline and many obvious details are held back simply because they would telegraph the ending too soon . Finally solving the case has less to do with deduction than it does with finding the person who knew what happened all along.Yet there 's a lingering presence of melancholy present that makes the story more important for its context than its content . Christie knew that she was nearing the end of her life when she wrote it and so there 's an emphasis on lost love putting the past to rest and young couples looking forward to the future with hope . Likewise the fact that Christie may have been in the first stages of Alzheimer 's disease brings certain bittersweetness to the fact that the novel relies so heavily on the importance of memory.It 's rather sad to read but impossible to dismiss if you are lasting fan of the author especially since it 's clear that Christie was getting ready to say goodbye . ",2
"I reread this one recently as it was one of the first Christie novels I read as a teen . Something about it had always stuck in my mind . It is interesting rereading all her novels now and especially interesting to see the reviews of this one.Funnily enough I agree that it has several weaknesses and the fact that this is a later Christie shows . There are some points a couple of children mentioned that I thought would at least be interviewed are only mentioned no presentday action etc that make this book compare unfavourably to her better ones . Also Poirot does n't quite sound like himself in this one and if Ariadne Oliver irritates you you may want to pass anyway ! Having said that there is something quite melancholy and haunting about the ultimate resolution . If you take this more as a romantic mysterytragedy I think you will appreciate it better . ",3
"It could have been solved in half the time . But it is not and to appreciate or understand this novel readers must place it in the proper context.The problem was at first vague Ariadne Oliver was asked by a stranger if the mother of Ariadne 's goddaughter killed the father or was it viceversa . The deaths were actually some twenty years or more before . As the stranger was the mother to a man who was contemplating marriage to Ariadne 's goddaughter she could be partially forgiven for her apparent concern . Of course one of the things Ariadne did was to call on Hercule Poirot and together they embarked on elephantchase to pry for secrets from the past.Elephants can remember was published in 1972 that is 52 years after the first Poirot novel The Mysterious Affairs at Styles . Many people did not even live that long . Agatha Christie aged her characters along with the years and therefore there were cases that were different from bodies being found all over the place.Other similar novels before this whereby Christie 's detectives investigate deaths long in the past included Dumb Witness Five Little Pigs Mrs McGinty 's Dead Ordeal By Innocence and Nemesis . The common theme among them was that the investigators had to depend on memories of various people who might not even be present but from their recollections clues were found to provide either the definitive picture of the culprits or the definitive picture of the crime . What a lot of impatient readers would find irritating was having to sift through the useful information from the useless . Elephants is such another tale.Mystery veterans would probably have been able to jump to the solution before Poirot 's grand finale but would they have been able to unravel the threads in the manner necessary ? Proofs have to be gathered and evidence motivation etc were all the necessary persuasions for Elephants before they would give up their secrets.The meat and drink of this novel is more than solving the mystery of who killed who but to recapture the atmosphere the mood the aura of that time in the past and to be able to put events in their proper perspectives . Also no less important was Poirot 's being able to relate the past in its correct perspective and its impact on the present in order for persuade the elephants to give up their secrets . ",2
"When Adriane Oliver noted crime author is asked if she knows great whether her Goddaughter 's mother killed her father or vice versa she enlists the help of the great Belgian slueth Hercule Poirot to uncover the truth of a strange double suicide or was it murder from the past.Through a series of interviews often revealing conflicting views on the same events Ms. Oliver and Poirot reconstruct the sequence of events leading up to the deaths in question . Personally I enjoyed this book . Christies narrative is top notch and the solution to the mystery is neatly tied up and intuitive . I tought Christie did an excellent job of taking the reader from point A to point B and all the way to the end . Little clues were dropped along the way as well as a few blind turns . As always Christie 's characters are interesting and wellwritten . My only complaint and its a minor one is that the solution was a bit predictable . Not necessarily a bad thing . ",3
"This novel is very slow moving repetitve and it is totally lacking in charm or suspense . There was not enough material for a novel in this story . Poor Poirot ! Poor reader . Skip this one . ",0
"This novel written in the twilight of Dame Agatha 's long and illustrious career 1972 would have been better left on the cutting room floor . It was especially painful for me to read because I not long ago reread her vibrant lively and completely mystifying Murder at the Vicarage which was written in 1927 . The comparison was depressing.Hercule Poirot is teamed with Mrs. Oliver a crime novelist to find the truth of a 1520 year old murdersuicide . Mrs. Oliver 's goddaughter Celia is the daughter of the couple who supposedly entered this pact . For the first onehalf of the book we are not advanced an inch in any direction . Many people are interviewed the elephants of the title and most have vague memories of the couple as does Mrs. Oliver herself . Mrs. O 's dithering is not artlessly charming for we are as confused as she . Saddest cut of all the red herrings are not herrings at all . They are giant signposts . Rather than Poirot gracefully unraveling the mystery on the last page the reader has left him in the dust 50 pages ago . The prose has a distinctly purplish hue.According to the publisher Elephants Can Remember was originally published as Five Little Pigs . I do not recommend this book because it does not do Dame Agatha justice . There are 75 titles to choose that will far better reflect her abilities and why she earned the title Queen of Crime . ",1
"This mystery novel with 'Elephants ' in its title uses the word elephant metaphorically to identify humans with long memories . The protagonist Ariadne Oliver with help from investigator Hercule Poirot contacts such 'elephants ' to find the answers to a twelve year old double suicide or murdersuicide that being the mystery.Story has nothing to do with real elephants and no elephant ever appears in it . Enjoyable typical of Christie stories I think . ",2
"What happens when a bent opportunist finds himself personna non grata with officialdom ? He looks out for number one in highly unexpected and potentially profitable ways . Eric Ambler reprises his greatest character Arthur Abdel Simpson from Light of Day in an entirely new adventure set in the heart of Africa.If you have not yet read Light of Day definitely read that wonderful novel before Dirty Story . Light of Day precedes this book in time and is the better book by a wide margin . Your appreciation of Dirty Story will be much higher as well.Dirty Story chronicles what happened to Arthur Abdel Simpson after he used his temporary travel permit to get back into Greece at the end of Light of Day . The book opens with an interview Simpson has with the British viceconsul in Athens while attempting to renew his expired British passport . In the interview the viceconsul strips away any remaining illusions we may have about Simpson 's claims to being an honest citizen with legitimate antecedents . After describing the ugly reality behind Simpson 's many claims the viceconsul sums it all up as follows You 're disgusting Mr. Simpson . Your life is nothing but a long dirty story . To add injury to the insult the viceconsul assures Simpson that all British consular officials around the world are now aware that they should be sure not to help him.Having neither a valid British nor an Egyptian passport Simpson is at a loss for how to renew his Greek residence and work permits . He decides he has to raise the money for a flag of convenience passport from a gobetween but he has n't the money to buy one . He soon finds himself doing another dirty deed to earn the money for which he has to unexpectedly flee Greece while possessing neither money nor passport . In his usual opportunistic way he pretends to be what he is not . . . and soon has convinced others that he is an experienced soldier of fortune . This false representation leads him to being shipped with a band of mercenaries into a border region contested between two African countries trying to seize a rare mineral deposit before the other side secures it.The complications rapidly mount from there . Much like State of Siege there are multiple allegiances and the need to watch out for one 's own skin no matter how the cause turns out . You 'll love the almost tongueincheek description of the mining companies the governments of the countries and the mercenaries . In the midst of it Simpson plays a virtual Shakespearean clown 's role in trying to upset some of the various plans much like he did in Light of Day.This book is n't nearly as much fun as Light of Day . It has a grimmer darker and more serious tone . But if you love Arthur Abdel Simpson you owe it to yourself to read this book.After you finish this book take some time to recount how an objective viewer might describe your background . Compare that objective account to the way you normally present yourself . Is your selfdescription a selfdelusion or an accurate view that will be helpful to others.If you find that exercise to be a useful one go on to think about what you would have to change in your life for your history to be one that others would describe with honor and admiration .

"I decided to read this book because I had tried some current suspense fiction but was boggled by the droneon convoluted writing style . Is there no one who writes clear crisp English with interesting characters and easytofollow plotlines ? I asked myself . The answer was Yes ! Eric Ambler . I 've read most of his books but not this one . I vaguely remembered A.A. Simpson from the Light of Day.So I was pleased to discover just the sort of book I was looking for sly humor great human insight and a plot that started continued and ended satisfactorily . Thank you ! The three reviews that follow mine are excellent by the way especially the first one . ",2
"For today 's reader one of the reasons why Eric Ambler is so appealing is that he was a great chronicler of contemporary events . In the years before the Second World War he wrote about the rise of fascism . In the years immediately following the War he wrote about the domination of Eastern Europe by the Soviets . In the 1950 's his best novels take place in Southeast Asia right after the Wars of Decolonization . Looking back from the Twenty First Century Eric Ambler 's historical judgement is nearly perfect . He knew evil when he saw it and he was not afraid to point it out.Dirty Story was written in 1967 . White mercenaries were still active in Central Africa . Ambler 's usually approach is to take an average person and have them through chance placed into an extraordinary situation . To tell his story of mercenaries Ambler dusted off Arthur Abdel Simpson a middle aged petty criminal with a talent for survival . Through many mishaps Simpson ends up in Central Africa working as a mercenary for a Multinational with mineral interests in a contested border region.Ambler 's best known books are set in the years right before the Second World War . They are still read because the Second World War is an era that most readers can still identify with . The books he wrote after the War are not as well known . I have read most of Ambler 's novels and I think Dirty Story is as good as his better known novels . Highly Recommended . ",4
"Eric Ambler specialized in stories of international intrigue featuring unlikely protagonists . Dirty Story is no exception . You 'd have a hard time finding a protagonist more unlikely than the very weasellike Arthur Abdel Simpson.By birth Simpson is 50 % British and 50 % Egyptian . But by nature he is 100 % chiseler . When circumstances dictate that he leave Athens rather abruptly in order to avoid arrest Simpson finds himself signing on with a mercenary security force in French Equatorial Africa . This despite the fact his background and temperment make him utterly unsuited for such a job.Dirty Story is about a violent border dispute over mining rights between two third world nations . Be forewarned that most of the native Africans in this novel are spoken of in very disparaging and racist terms by the white characters.Ambler is a very skillful and clever writer . The narrative moves along quite smoothly and a number of astute insightful observations about geopolitics are made.This novel clearly is one of Ambler 's lesser works but worthwhile reading nonetheless .

"Arthur Simpson man without a country is trying desperately to get a passport any passportthe country is of no consequence . To do this he needs cash so he is hired to make a pornographic movie but that goes pear shaped.After his directing debut he finds himself on a ship hiding but he still has no passport . On board thanks to the fact that he is an inveterate liar he signs a contract to fight with a band of mercenaries in a African back water that is hoping to realise great mineral wealth.So even though our hero is a loser liar and not a very nice person he manages to land on his feet if not entirely squarely.Eric Ambler does not write dull stuff this is n't one of his best works but its pure entertainment from the start if you are lucky enough to find it at a garage sale grab it .

"The other reviewers are rightread THE LIGHT OF DAY first . And then get ready for a less clever but more disturbing adventure with sleezy subjugated cabdriver Arthur Abdel Simpson.The dangers in THE LIGHT OF DAY were being sent to prison for life andor being killed by angry criminals . In DIRTY STORY the danger is at least equally bad becoming stateless a noncitizen everywhere prohibited from working or living anywhere . An illustrative line is Finally we were informed that if either of us were still in the country one week hence he had better be able to swim.We get more philosophical musings on Simpson 's childhood and helpful wisdom from his late father . Unhelpful wisdom too . And our travelling companions include some people quite a bit more sinister than anyone in LIGHT including the crazy cook.In this novel Simpson does something new . Something he almost never does and which we have never before seen him do . It 's pretty satisfying . ",3
"One of the master 's best though it moves from the smokefilled alleys of prewar Europe to the uncertainties of the postwar . The two central characters are n't trying to right a wrong or uncover a secret but to get hold of a valuable stash of papers which will allow them to undertake a blackmailing operation . Can they do so without getting killed and while falling in love ? Terrific story engaging if flawed characters and a great sendup of American magazine journalism in the 1950 's ",4
"The novels he had written before the war had established his reputation as one the finest spy novelists of his time . After the war and a collaboration on several novels with Charles Roddaas Eliot Reed and a stint in Hollywood writing for movies and televisionhe returned to the novel of espionage and intrigue and proceeded to write several of the best post war books of the genre.This oneA Kind of Anger is one of the best and most entertaining .

"To read or not to read the great spy novels of Eric Ambler ? That is the question most people ignore because they are not familiar with Mr. Ambler and his particularly talent.Mr . Ambler has always had this problem . As Alfred Hitchcock noted in his introduction to Intrigue an omnibus volume containing Journey into Fear A Coffin for Dimitrios Cause for Alarm and Background to Danger Perhaps this was the volume that brought Mr. Ambler to the attention of the public that make bestsellers . They had been singularly inattentive until its appearance I suppose only God knows why . He goes on to say They had not even heeded the critics who had said from the very first that Mr. Ambler had given new life and fresh viewpoint to the art of the spy novel an art supposedly threadbare and certainly clich & eacuteinfested.So what 's new and different about Eric Ambler writing ? His heroes are ordinary people with whom almost any reader can identify which puts you in the middle of a turmoil of emotions . His bad guys are characteristic of those who did the type of dirty deeds described in the book . His angels on the sidelines are equally realistic to the historical context . The backgrounds histories and plot lines are finely nuanced into the actual evolution of the areas and events described during that time . In a way these books are like historical fiction except they describe deceit and betrayal rather than love and affection . From a distance of over 60 years we read these books today as a way to step back into the darkest days of the past and relive them vividly . You can almost see and feel a dark hand raised to strike you in the back as you read one of his book 's later pages . In a way these stories are like a more realistic version of what Dashiell Hammett wrote as applied to European and Middle Eastern espionage.Since Mr. Ambler wrote the thrillers have gotten much bigger in scope . . . and moved beyond reality . Usually the future of the human race is at stake . The heroes make Superman look like a wimp in terms of their prowess and knowledge . There 's usually a love interest who exceeds your vision of the ideal woman . Fastpaced violence and killing dominate most pages . There are lots of toys to describe and use in imaginative ways . The villains combine the worst faults of the 45 most undesirable people in world history and have gained enormous wealth and power while being totally crazy . The plot twists and turns like cruise missile every few seconds in unexpected directions . If you want a book like that please do not read Mr. Ambler 's work . You wo n't like it.If you want to taste touch smell see and hear evil from close range and move through fear to defeat it Mr. Ambler 's your man.In A Kind of Anger Piet Maas a barely hanging on journalist is given a tough assignment to find a mysterious witness to a murder in Switzerland whom no one else can find . But he is given a clue . . . a connection who may know the blonde bikinied woman .

In the process of taking on large risks with Lucia Bernardi the blonde he regains his desire to live . You 'll find yourself pulling for the two scammers as they hold their document auction.After you finish this story I suggest that you think about what would inspire you to attempt more . . . accomplish more . . . and extend yourself beyond what you think you can achieve .

"Let me start by saying that the Eric Ambler 's books are truly a work of art . I have read and enjoyed the entire series I recommend that everyone read his books . That said this novel is not among his best but still good . To be read after you have read his classic novels first . ",3
"This is typical Ambler the everyman hero the sinister but identifiably human forces manipulating events the threatened damsel the travelogue of venues . The hero a nearlyfailed journalist in this outing survives through pluck and steady thinking rather than brawn and gadgets . In his day Ambler was the antiIan Fleming closer in some ways to Le Carre but less cerebral than to the spyadventure novelists such as Fleming and Matt Helm 's Donald Hamilton.The joy of Ambler is the scale of his stories . It 's easy to place yourself in the hero 's shoes to see yourself reacting to the various threats and adventures in much the same way without having to engage in wild flights of fancy . While the villains are formidable they 're also human with understandable motives and behaviors . The hero usually earns the girl rather than having her fall instantly into heat for him . In some ways you 'll be reminded of Hitchcock . Even fifty years later these stories still work.Understand that while A Kind of Anger and Ambler 's other books were billed as thrillers by modern standards they 're nearly cozies . There are no endoftheworld tropes no megarich master villains no psychotic indestructible henchmen no fabulous gadgets a low body count no onstage sex . Ambler wrote about a version of the real world that modern thrillers often leave behind . If this sounds hopelessly quaint to you move on . If you 're in the mood for some 1960s70s intrigue that does n't involve James Bond and does n't make you work as hard as Smiley you could do worse than Eric Ambler . ",3
"Legendary author Eric Ambler achieved great success in relating well researched stories of international intrigue featuring unlikely protagonists . A Kind of Anger follows that same formula.The star of this 1960s novel is Piet Maas a Dutch born researcher for the Paris bureau of an American weekly news magazine . Maas is a self confessed neurotic whose journalistic career has gone from bad to worse . When an Iraqi colonel is brutally murdered in Switzerland his mistress a young Frenchwoman goes into hiding . It is left to Maas to find her and report back to the rest of the world the circumstances that led to her lover being killed . Once Maas comes face to face with the elusive mystery woman he abandons any semblance of journalistic professionalism . Instead of reporting the news he starts making news of his own.A Kind of Anger is a fast paced cloak and dagger tale whose protagonist is very much a fish out of water . The narrative is quite detailed as Ambler expertly describes the novel 's many interesting characters and the various mostly French settings against which the action unfolds . Recommended to fans of international intrigue . ",3
"While I usually love Agatha Christie I found this novel rather dull and quite disappointing . It was n't the typical bodyatthestart book where a mystery must be solved and that may be part of the reason I did n't enjoy it as much in addition the twist seemed to come on a bit too fast . I felt like I knew the twist but only because I think ?

I 've read almost all of her crime novels and I must say if you 're a truly Christie fan you wo n't get disappointed with this one.Endless Night was more melodramatic than the others I 've read . The murder was n't come until half of the book and even so there was n't any rapid investigation like when she writes about Poirot and Miss Marple . But the ending was surely Christie 's style ",3
"Well it is not the classical Agatha scheme and it does n't have a central character as Poirot or Ms Mapple but nevertheless is interesting the end is unexpected as usual . ",2
"Completely different from any of her other books this is the story of a psychopathic killer born to endless night . Chapter by chapter we see the desires and motivations of the character unfold . Be prepared for an Agatha Christie with no detection but spellbinding suspense that entertains completely . ",4
"This mystery is a small masterpiece . Though it does n't feature Christie 's beloved detectives Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot in fact it does n't have a detective in it at allit 's a stunning depiction of what M. Poirot is fond of calling the psychology of a murderer . This is n't a book to begin with if you 've never read any Christie but if you 're already a fan it 's definitely worth a read . Christie in her own quiet way was also quite a social commentator and this book along with some of her others written in this period will show you what she thought of the sixties . ",4
"This is truly a departure from the whodunits everyone is familiar with from Dame Christie . In some ways I liked itit is a brooding novel that sort of captures you but in some ways I felt a little disappointed with the story line since I am so familiar with her other works that are always so special to me . This novel was written in the 1960s and I feel that she perhaps wanted to distance herself from the Poirot Marple and other characters she had created in the past . If written by anyone else I would probably have given it five stars . The character development and plot are fairly good and the ending has a bit of a twist although I must say I could n't really follow the reasoning completely . Unlike her other novels this is one that I do n't feel I would read again but I 'm glad that I had the experience of enjoying another look into the wonderful creative and sometimes devious mind of Agatha Christie . ",3
"I was completely shocked at the conclusion of this story . I never guessed that Mike killed his wife or the others . I realized the hints were there as I read the end . marvelous story by s wonderful author ",4
"As always Agatha Christie is entertaining and this book is a must for her fans . It 's been said thousands of times Agatha Christie was a master at her craft . Read and ENJOY . ",3
"A very interesting and entertaining story . A typical Agatha Christy novel . The conclusion is completely unexpected to the point that it is almost disappointing . A great book ! ",3
"I love Agatha Christie however it took me three tries to finish this book . I must admit that there came a point during the third try when I decided to skip half of the very wordy dialog to finally get through . 95 % of the dialog was by one person and most of that in his scheming lazy mind . Just happy to be done ! ",0
"This story is far removed from the usual Poirot & Marple stories which I have always enjoyed . It starts slowly and builds suspense and is full of false trails and twists . It is an original plot . The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I managed to figure it out before the solution was revealed . Still it is certainly worth reading for those who love a true and honest mystery and all the clues are there . ",3
"I 've been a fan of Agatha Christie mysteries ever since high school and the praise is well deserved that she had the capacity to lead readers down twisted and dimly lit paths strewn with red herrings whilst leaving the real clues in plain sight . This book is no exception . For as well versed as I always thought I was in discerning fake leads from genuine revelations this one completely surprised me and is worth five stars of enthusiasm.Christina HamlettAuthor of Eire Apparent ",4
"This was a substandard piece of work by Agatha Christie . The plot is boring . The main character unsympathetic . I did n't like it . ",1
"Agatha Christie 's Endless Night is far more than a great read a psychological thriller and a riveting mystery it 's one of the most insightfulbooks about a sociopathic predator and his beguiling mask of sanity I have read . ",4
"Always a good read.page after page keeping you coming back for more . Her endings are always . A breath taker .leaving saying I should have known . ",4
"I chose this rating because the book was interesting and held my interest most of the time but not all of the time . The ending was not expected and was unusual . There were really good parts but sometime it was ho hum ! ",2
"I read Agatha Christie 's Endless Night almost 40 ago and did not like it at all then . As other reviewers have noted it is not a typical Christie mystery . Not only did it stray from Christie 's classic crimedeductionsolution process but it lacked the humor that is one of her hallmarks.I thought I 'd try it again to see whether age and experience would make me more appreciative . Well yes and no . I still do not like the dark heavy suspensebuilding structure of the novel . I still definitely miss the humor . But this time around knowing the twist at the end I could admire her fair play the clues are all provided.I have to respect Ms Christie for her willingness to experiment so late in her career . In Endless Night she has produced a good wellplotted suspense novel . Nevertheless I wish she had written another Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple book . ",3
"I like Christie 's Poirot and Miss Marple mysteries so I thought I 'd try something different by her . The plot develops well for most of the novel but then it goes totally off the rails with the abrupt twist near the end . It feels as if Christie could n't think where else to go with the original plot and so created another story altogether to finish things off . After the twist the ending is hurried and unconvincing and quite unsatisfying . A real shamewith a more plausible ending it could have been one of her best . ",2
"Endless Night by Agatha Christie further solidifies her as the Queen of Mysteries it 's magnificent . The number of twists turns and misdirection 's in this story are mindboggling you will think you are lost in an English labyrinth . The ending is startling and totally unexpected at least for me it was . If you are a fan of murder mysteries and enjoy solving the case as you are reading you are going to love this story it just does n't get much better than this ",3
"What can you say ? Different from the usual Agatha but masterful as usual . Read it right away . Agatha fans will be surprised by this deviation from her usual but delighted with a fantastic story ",4
"I read this book right after I read And Then There Were None also by Agatha Christie . While I enjoyed Endless Night a lot I loved And Then There Were None so possibly I would have given this book a 5 star if I had read it earlier or later . There was nothing wrong with the book . The plot being about a man who is poor and ends up meeting this wonderful woman from America getting married and having a house built on cursed land . The plot keeps you interested but I felt at some parts that I was really ready for SOMETHING to happen anything . In And Then There Were None for me the build up was much more interesting . Either way tho I will be reading more by Agatha Christie soon as I am just seeing what I have been missing all these years ! ",3
"Great story beautifully told . This story is more poetically written than Christie 's usual mysteries . Hooefully other swill enjoy it as much as I did . ",4
"Agatha Christie is very good I did n't like the betrayal by the main character just my preference in books I read ",3
"this book is better than i supposed.if u are a crime fiction votaryor christie votaryu must read this.very good . ",4
"Unlike most of Christie 's mysteries Endless Night is not written from the detective 's point of view . It 's a good read . ",3
"Critics tend to debate what era can most appropriately be called Agatha Christie 's golden eraand there is much to be said for her work in the 1930s the 1940s and the 1950s . But like her earliest works of the 1920s her later works of the 1960s are negelected . And in the case of ENDLESS NIGHT this is an oversight indeed.ENDLESS NIGHT presents us with Mike a restless young man who has drifted from job to job without seeming to find any true satisfactionand a young man who is fascinated by Gipsy 's Acre a plot of land in rural England said to be cursed by the Gipsies who once lived there and who were driven away . While walking the property which has come up for sale he meets an attractive young American woman and a whirlwind courtship ensues . It is not until well into the relationship that the woman Ellie discloses that she is rich . And not just rich she is the heiress to a fabulous fortune.The two marry and hire a noted architect to construct the perfect home on Gipsy 's Acrebut no sooner are they installed then the property 's legendary curse begins to unfold . A local gipsy woman warns them of bad luck rocks are flung through windows a bird is found pinned to the front door with a dagger . And they are surrounded by Ellie 's relatives and business relations all of whom seem to have hidden agendas and none of whom like the fact that Ellie has been torn from their control.Many Christie novels can be read in a single sitting but ENDLESS NIGHT has an unusually slow buildand Christie defies her detractors who often accused her of purely mechanical construction by creating an atmosphere that collects into deepest darkness before the novel 's startling conclusion . As she often did Christie lifts a plot twist from a previous novel for this later tale and those who have read her more famous books may spot the trick even so this is not a copy of an earlier work for the device upon which the inevitable crime hangs is used in a remarkably different way and instead of the neatly drawn crimedetectionsolution path of most of her works ENDLESS NIGHT is a multiple character study that gradually descends into a Hitchcockian horror . Perhaps the finest of her late work and strongly recommended.GFT Amazon.com Reviewer ",4
"Michael Rogers is a simple chauffeur whose only contact with wealth is through his rich and famous passengers . While dropping off a passenger in Kingston Bishop Rogers discovers the Towers a decrepit Victorian house up for auction . He immediately falls in love with the beautiful location Gipsy 's Acre the house is build on but of course he can only dream of owning such a property . Then the impossible happens he falls in love with the wealthy Ellie Goodman . Before long they are Mr. and Mrs. Rogers and Gipsy 's Acre is theirs . But when Mrs. Lee warns them of the curse their luck seems to have come to an end.Of Endless Night 1967 Agatha Christie claimed that it was one of her favourites and I can certainly see why . The ingenious plot manages to avoid death itself for no less than the first three quarters of the book . Only near the denouement does the book become a detective story . At first the story tends to be perceived as long and tedious but when all clues finally come together the significance of that happened before can only amaze the reader.Quite remarkable for an Agatha Christie novel is the strongly developed characters . Whereas Christie in most of her later works seems engulfed by the idea that the modern youth is lazy and completely useless in Endless Night she clearly proves the opposite . Never are the main characters depicted as a caricature . When you know the solution to the mystery you will understand that she did this with a reason . ",4
"Starts slow but builds to a huge surprise . Many details that seem irrelevant take on a different meaning at the end . Heavy on characterization and psychology . Complex relationships abound . Highly recommended . ",4
"I bought this audio book to occupy me during a few days ' 'holiday at home ' and could n't have chosen better it 's the perfect relaxation to sit back and have a vocally very talented actor tell such a dark intriguing story.Although a great Christie fan this is amazingly it now seems a story I 've never read but I shall now buy the book also because as with all Christie stories knowing the outcome does n't detract from the rereading or relistening pleasure . The false leads and red herrings are dropped into the narrative with such skill that although they are small and subtle they still take you along a variety of wrong paths . The final unravelling is whilst not completely unexpected by that point satisfyingly dramatic and dark . And even at almost the very end Agatha Christie dares to tempt you with the possibility of a near impossible alternative ending . Brilliant ! ",4
"Having read a great deal of Agatha Christie this has to be my least favorite so far . It is a very psychological novel . I thought it was slow and uninteresting and I did no feel the ending was well done . I had to really drag myself through this . ",1
"AS ALL OF AGATHA CHRISTIE BOOKS THIS ONE KEEPS YOU TURNING THE PAGES TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXTAND YOU ARE NEVER DISAPPOINTED . ",3
"The Endless Night is a fine novel written outside the famous Poirot series . Agatha Christie did a marvelous job on the setting and the main theme of the novel . The novel is a twoprong approach to a mysterythriller and a mysteryhorror . The reader remains wondering and awaiting for the murder and in the process attempts many guesses . However interesting is the setting end is that much disappointing . I say this because as the reader ventures towards the end the conclusion becomes obvious . But then again it is the case with majority of the novels by Agatha . I therefore believe that her novels should be read for variety of interesting ideas and past time reading rather than a nutcracker mystery . I am a fan of Agatha especially when it comes to early 20th century settings and the adventures Poirot . ",2
"My kindle version of this book . I like Agatha Christie books . Her style of writing and the way she draws you into the lives of the people keeps you picking up the book ! Nice story . ",4
"ENDLESS NIGHT published in 1967 in the UK as a Collins Crime Club selection was the 60th detectivemystery novel written by Dame Agatha Christie 18901976 who wrote 66 such works . It is a standalone novel not a Poirot nor Miss Marple written in three parts.Part One introduces the four main characters Michael Rogers a young drifter currently employed as a chauffeur has a chance meeting with the lovely Ellie Goodman . He dreams of building a magnificent house on a particular spot of land along the Devon coast . Unknown to him she is actually a wealthy American heiress and can make his dream come true . With the help of her efficient German companion Greta Andersen they marry and build a memorable home designed by noted but ailing architect Rudolph Santonix.Naturally the plot thickens the land the couple purchased is known as Gypsy 's Acre and is said to carry a curse . Mysterious accidents pile up a selfproclaimed gypsy haunts the grounds and after a midnight accident Greta moves in with the couple to nurse Ellie back to health much to Michael 's resentment . And all the while the few relatives a stepmother and a few cousins and many trustees guardians and attorneys disapprove of their young ward 's marriage.A crime novel ? Not so far . But read on as I did after thinking Dame Agatha has lost her marbles . What starts as a romantic thriller becomes a mild literary success for the Queen of Mystery receiving some of the warmest critical response of her career . The London Times Literary Supplement states in 1967 that ENDLESS NIGHT written in the persona of a workingclass boy who marries a poor little rich girlis a pleasantly gothic story of gypsy warnings and that Christie brings it all off together with a nicely melodramatic final twist . Robert Bernard mystery writer and critic considers ENDLESS NIGHT a splendid late flowering and the best of the late Christie . He notes in his workA Talent to Deceive An Appreciation of Agatha Christie that the plot contains a combination of patterns used in THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD 1926 and DEATH ON THE NILE 1937 and similarities in the treatment of heiressheroine 's American lawyers in NILEsuggesting she had been rereading . He adds The murder occurs very late and thus the central section seems desultory even novelettish poor little rich girl gypsy 's curse etc.. But all is justified by the conclusion.Regardless of your reaction to the novel 's ending I believe you will find that ENDLESS NIGHT is a very good read . I agree with the laudatory review in the UK newspaper The Guardian The old maestrina of the crimenovel or whatever is the female of 'maestro ' pulls yet another out of her inexhaustible bagquite different in tone from her usual work . It is impossible to say much about the story without giving away vital secrets sufficient to warn the reader that if he should think this is a romance he could n't be more mistaken and the crashing not to say horrific suspense at the end is perhaps the most devastating that this surpriseful author has ever brought off . ",3
"but wonderful in its own way . This is one of Christie 's 'nonseries ' books no Poirot Miss Marple Tommy and Tuppence etc . Also it is MUCH darker and more serious than her usual work this is not one to give a 'younger or more sensitive reader ' . It is however an example of just how talented an author Christie was capable of much more than clever formulistic detective stories.This moody 1967 novel is told by Mike Rogers a young man who drifted from job to job looking for something he was n't sure of just what . He found his passion in a place Gipsy Acre a piece of ground that he wanted to buy and build a marvelous house on a house designed by a famous architect he had met . The problem was that Mike had no money and very little chance of ever getting the kind of money he would need for this dream . By chance he met a beautiful young woman who happened to be fabulously wealthy . They fell in love married and.well read the book.Again this is definitely not a 'cozy ' mystery it is dark disturbing and scary . It is one of those books that will stay with you and haunt you for years to come . As with all Christies the clues are all there for you to follow you may or may not guess the killer and there is definitely a Christie twist at the finish . ",4
"No Poirot or Marple but who cares when it is this good ? ! This book is so well written it will keep you up reading . ",4
"Having read so many of Christie 's works I was surprised I had missed this one . True to Christie style the reader is captivated at the onset and remains so seeking the resolution to the uncertainly of the tale until the final page . ",4
"I had picked up a hint somewhere that this was not exactly among Agatha Christie 's best novels and if anything it was perhaps typical of what 's seen as a decline in her last decade . Not therefore entertaining high expectations I picked this up on a Sunday afternoon and was pleased to find it a pretty engaging story . Rather uncommon for an AC novel the crime does not even happen till far into the work here is a case where you pretty much know or think you do the setting and the dramatis personae and even the clues BEFORE the misdeed is committed which makes for a nice twist I thought . It is a richly evil story . Mike the narrator and main dramatis persona is pretty deftly drawn . In fact I feel he 's got more substance and complexity to him than any other AC character that comes to mind at the moment . There is a scene that proves a crossroads in this story which Mike himself recognizes as such and it is poignant indeed . On the other hand I think the basic plot with the oil heiress strains credence a bit even for a mystery novel and yet maybe this is part of the game . Some characters like Lippincott and Cora strike me a bit as creaky stereotypes . Also like some other late AC novels Postern of Fate and Elephants Can Remember come to mind the writing and fleshingout has ahow to put ita somehow professional methodical almost mechanical aspect to my mind . It 's hard to explain but I wonder if perhaps AC in her late years limited her work perhaps developing the basic outline but letting skilled assistants fill in much of it . Finally there is what I felt a certain degree of excess towards the end that mars the story for me somewhat . It 's still a pretty good story regardless.I 've only read around 25 AC novels over the years barely got my feet wet compared to other reviewers here I see ! . I guess my favorite by her would be Murder of Roger Ackroyd And Then There Were None Murder in Retrospect and Sleeping Murder . ",2
"I do not really understand how could all of the reviewers recommend this book . I did not think it was that good it was rather slow and sorry to say boring.If you have read many books by Agatha Christie and want to read this book go ahead but you might not like because it is not so thrilling.If you really want to read some good stuff by Mrs Christie go for The Secret adversery a tommy and Tuppence mystery it is not really bad and you might like it.If you want to read good mysteries I would recommend Georges Simenon 's Maigret 's Novels they are really good and M. Simenon is big time better than Mrs Christie sorry to say that but try and see ",0
"Great book by a great author . Definitely worth the read from beginning to fantastic ending it keeps you engrossed in the story . ",4
"Endless Night is not a typical Agatha Christie . If you 're looking for Poirot or Miss Marple you wo n't find them here . Instead you get a moody highly suspenseful almost gothic novel about a young man who dreams an impossible dream and makes it come true..for a price . The ending is the most second most shocking one Christie ever wrote . My only complaint is with this edition . The picture on the cover has n't a thing to do with the book . ",4
"This is set in a 3 book style . It is very much a departure from Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple . There is suspense a bit of horror and some mystery . I read the first 2 books and it was not to my taste but as usual for Agatha well written and developed . ",2
"I love Agatha Christie & I really think this story although a bit outside of her normal writing style is HER BEST ! A page turner & twists and turns that you NEVER see coming ! I really loved it ! And I could n't stop talking about it ! All Agatha Christie novels are not created equalTHIS is the BEST EVER ! ",4
"I just finished this book and all I can say is wow . A beautifully written novel that just shocks you in the end . I was completely stunned and I think this might be my new favorite by Christie . You will never see the end result coming even though she gives you hints throughout the whole book . A great journey into the deths of the human mind . I am surprised that this is one of her lesser known titles it was brillant . A must read Agatha Christie has outdone herself again . ",4
"I like happy endings and this one did not have one . It was boring until the 17th chpt . I felt like I was reading an Alfred Hitchcock book . I figured out most of who the killer was and what was going to happen but the last few pages blew my mind . ",1
"The writing is excellent as always ! This had a different point of view than most of her writing and did n't feature any of the normal cast of characters . Solidly English this was a great read and an ending you would n't expect . ",3
"Absolutely my favorite Agatha Christie book . I loved the surprise ending . I have a paperback copy in my bookcase but it had been years since I had read it as the printing is too small for me to read now . I wanted to read it again and I now have a Kindle love my Kindle so I got it for the Kindle . I still think it is a great story and still love the ending . Of course Agatha Christie is still one of the best . ",4
"Big fan of Agatha Christie but while I 'm used to the slow build up of her stories this one did n't deliver at the end . I think it 's because I did n't find the characters compelling . All rather dull people . ",2
"Who says Agatha Christie only produces stock charaters ? This is a very deft portrayal of a man with a different background from many of her main characters with personality and quirks . The novel transcends into the suspense genre and Dame Agatha very effectively comes up with an unreliable narrator for a for her rather unusual mystery . One of my favorites along with Sleeping Murder . ",4
"This book was very different from Christie 's other writings and I was very excited about reading it . Unfortunately it was much too dark for me . SPOILER ALERTI felt that the story being told by the murderer was horrible and the whole book was a huge disappointment . ",0
"This book looks interesting but I 'd rather say I was dissappointed having read almost all Christie 's books.Get it only if you plan to collect every Agatha book . If you are a newbie in the Christie world or you want only the tops this is n't for you . ",1
"Every once a while when I want a good read I turn to an Agatha Christie novel . This one takes place in England and the story moves nicely . It has a surprise ending and I really enjoyed it . ",4
"This was an incredibly strange story . It was a tad boring in the beginning then it gripped my attention but I hated the ending . ",2
"This book held my interest from the very beginning andI was very surprised at the ending . Another good mystery . ",3
"This is a Christie mystery without one of her 3 main detectives Poirot Miss Marple and Tommy & Tuppence . That in itself is not unusual but it differs from her other books dramatically as well . Even ignoring the basic structural differences it seems to me that usually her murderers are relatively straightforward in their psychologies . In this one however she touches on evil of a more absolute nature . I have searched and failed to find the poem that I memorizedwhich I 'm pretty sure was in this book . It goesEvery night and every morn some to misery are born.Every morn and every night some are born to sweet delight.Some are born to sweet delight some are born to endless night.I think it gives the essence of what the book is trying to sayfar beyond being a mystery novel . If you want to see Christie in more serious perhaps enigmatic statement read the book . Do n't expect the usual Christie . ",3
"This is my first Christie novelI 've read some other reviews saying that this book is n't recommended as an introduction to her work since it 's not typical of her usual mysteriesbut I have to disagree . This novel only makes me want to dive head first into another one ! It had me from start to finishI quite enjoyed the inner monologue and first person narration and about halfway through I was held in the grip of the most uneasy sense of creepiness that started colouring the story . There were points in the book where I actually looked over my shoulderThe suspense character development and smattering of clues that only made sense as such at the end all make for a superb edge of your seat portrayal of the inner workings of a mind gone horribly wrong.If you enjoy character development over plot happenings glimpsing into a personality driven by darkness and a book that will have you thinking about it days after you 've finished then this is the novel for you .

"I was so moved by this book that I wish to share my exhilarating read w others in hopes of encouraging them to read it.Like many reviewers here I am a fan of AC . And yet I 'd have to agree w the majority here that Endless Night is by far the most unconventional work of AC . Again I 'd agree w most of the critques in that the story moves w consistency yet a bit slower for an AC . Indeed Endless Night can be undoubtedly labeled a mystery but not the typical mystery that one would come to expect from an AC book . The plot is heavily laced w melodrama evil beyond comprehension and an impending doom that seems to get under the skin of a compassionate reader . Out of all of the 8 AC novels that I 've read I never sympathized w any of AC 's characters until I read this piece . My heart bled for the victim as much as for the perpetrator . So much so that I woke up the next day STILL contemplating these characters ! ! The only reservation I had about it was that AC managed to overlook a cpl of minuscule details that were never explained at the end . To the avg reader it may not matter but for the analyticals at heart it may . Overall an EXCELLENT READ ! ! ! ! ",4
"I have only read two or three Christie mysteries . This one was very good . Yes the beginning was rather slow it meandered here and there to what seemed meaningless tangents . However by the end of the book it all comes together . The second half of the book is a real page turner . By the time you get that far you wo n't want to put it down . ",3
"It is really amazing how prolific Agatha Christie was without repeating herself . The woman was a much underrated genius at murder mysteries.This book has a very interesting twist at the end that really smacks you like cold water in the face . I had read this one before many years ago so I knew something was coming but could n't remember the details . It still was a surprise.You ca n't go wrong reading Christie and this book is no exception . It is n't one of her better known titles and of course has no Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot but sometimes those books are among her best.I recommend it . ",4
"This cozy murder mystery was a reread for me once shortly after its initial publication in 1967 and then again just last week . I have the Pocket Books paperback edition which first became available in 1969.THE STORY A roustabout and buoyant young man encounters a pretty young girl near a prime if a bit decrepit large and aging estate in the English countryside not far from London Gipsy 's sic Acre . They soon fall in love and ultimately acquire the property by means which you will learn by reading the book hoping to live there together happily ever after.But an old hag of a local Gypsy sternly cautions the pair that the land is cursed and after having read their fortunes belligerently warns the two to abandon the area forever however the amorous pair rejects the idea of bending to the superstitious rantings of a crank fortuneteller and so they proceed to pursue a life together tearing down the old mansion and constructing an avantgarde dwelling siteing it strategically on the iniquitous property.A number of intriguing characters highlight the story from my view at the cost of more than a little hyperbole on Christie 's part.Christie often spun her tales in First Person such as she did in here from the perspective of the fictional protagonistnarrator Mike Rogers . Unfortunately this account lacks the detailed atmosphere of the story environment as well as that of the people all of which has previously defined the excellence of Christie 's more renowned works such asThe Mysterious Affair at Styles Hercule Poirot MysteriesandThe Murder of Roger Ackroyd A Hercule Poirot Mystery Agatha Christie Collection . These notable voids in wallpaper can often occur throughout this and other genres of prose as a direct caveat of the First Person writing style but there is yet another specific reason for the attenuation of ambiance in this instance which I will discuss momentarily.The flavor of the story seems a hybrid of a typical Christie cozy murder case blended with one of her sprawling romance yarns which she penned under the pseudonym of Mary Westmacott ergoAbsent in the Spring Westmacott . I initially saw this element as a positive touch since the work represented something new and different . But sadly this story goes NOWHERE for about 100 pages redundant dialogue and text abounds . There is a specific reason as to why this happened which also accounts for the general lack of atmosphere which we have come to expect from ChristieMINOR SPOILER AHEAD ! If you have read all the Miss Marple stories in either The Regatta Mystery And Other Stories The Agatha Christie Mystery Collection originally published in 1939 or inMiss Marple The Complete Short Storiesthen you will have encountered a brief entry entitled The Case of the Caretaker . This abbreviated Miss Marple mystery of only fifteen pages lays out the entire plot of Endless Night which does not include Miss Marple.So it would appear that Christie seized upon a previously written story idea and proceeded to engorge it with literary filler to create the book under review here . I have no problem with that except that the enlarged account clearly lacks the author 's legendary distinction . Rewriting these shorter mysteries was something that Christie did from time to time . A wellknown example was when among other aspects she repenned The Regatta Mystery to supplant the more celebrated Detective Hercule Poirot with the lesser Detective Parker Pyne.In her autobiographyAgatha Christie An Autobiography Christie comments that during certain difficult periods she wrote stories which she did n't even recall later along in her life . That could indeed be the case here considering that she eventually authored a total of over eighty books and plays having read them all I 'll certainly give her the benefit of the doubt.One personal blog website which I encountered during my supplemental research for this review characterized The Case of the Caretaker as irritatingly predictable . To a somewhat lesser degree I would describe Endless Night in much the same way.In summary if you are a big Christie fan like me you 'll of course want to read Endless Night however if you 're a more casual reader of cozy murder mysteries I would steer you toward some of Christie 's superior works . If you wish to take in a good whodunit involving a multiple of Christie 's preeminent sleuths try readingCards on the Table Hercule Poirot . ",2
"Endless Night written late in Agatha Christie 's career shows well her gifts for clever plot lines and spare but effective characterizations as well as Christie 's solid ability to remain current to the times in which she wrote which spanned the end of the World War I through the early 1970s . Much has been written about Christie 's genius for constructing original puzzles but her writing in books like this makes such expositions superfluous.The solution to this mystery is as ingenious as the solutions to the crimes in Murder on the Orient Express The Murder of Roger Ackroyd and Ten Little Indians . This book is truly a mystery lover 's delight.DO NOT READ ANY REVIEWS REVEALING THE PLOT DEVICE ! ! ! ! This is one of the true mystery novels that should be read for the delight of its construction ! ",4
"One of Christie 's later novels first published in 1967 Endless Night was written well before her literary powers began to wane and ended up being one of her personal favorites.Initially Endless Night reads a little bit like a fairytale . Michael Rogers is a poor but ambitious young man who writes of his fascination for a stretch of wooded land known as Gipsy 's Acre said to be cursed by the gypsies that were turned off it and is in fact based on a real legend of a similarly named patch of land in Wales . A chance meeting with a beautiful young woman under the fir trees leads to a whirlwind romance an elopement and the revelation that she is in fact a very wealthy heiress . Suddenly all of Michael 's dreams are within his reach and together he and Ellie build their dream house on Gipsy 's Acre.But from the very first page of his narrative Michael makes it clear that disaster is on the horizon . It is impossible to say much more without giving away the entire book even the identity of the murder victim should be kept under wraps but Endless Night ends up being one of Christie 's most haunting novels and certainly the best of her late work.Readers who are ploughing through Christie 's books in chronological order or who are at least familiar with her writing may recognize some of the techniques she utilizes in order to shape the plot . There is one plot device in particular that she has used to great effect in the past and some longtime readers may pick up on it as they read . However even if one does figure it out the realization does little to sully the enjoyment of the story if anything it simply makes the slow buildup even more disturbing.But the story is unique in other ways . With a deft hand Christie ramps up the suspense by leaving the murder until quite late in the story and there is no detective character whatsoever . Instead the cast is relatively small with only a small pool of suspects made up of Ellie 's extended family and a few locals . Where most of her characters are usually stereotypes here they are given life and relationships that come before the needs of the plot a result of Endless Night being more of a character study than a whodunit.It is quite different in tone and structure from her usual work and the atmosphere is impeccable . It 's creepy and forbidding with an almost gothic ambiance to it thanks to the gypsy folklore and isolated country setting . Dread permeates every word and I actually felt physically cold when reading it . I 'd recommend a hot drink and a warm blanket if reading on a winter 's night.The less you know about Endless Night the more enjoyable your read will be . As such be very careful perusing some of these reviews as I 'm sure at least some of them will give the game away even if it 's just by referencing other Christie novels . With its slow burning setup and devastating d & eacutenouement Endless Night is easily one of my favorite Christies as well as one of her strongest works . ",4
"Endless Night is not Agatha Christie 's best mystery nor is it ranked among the favorites by Agatha Christie fans . Judged by the standards of the genre it is easily dismissed most commonly with a reference to her reuse of a plot technique she introduced many years earlier . But whatever it lacks as a mystery Endless Night is among the best stories Christie ever wrote.While Christie 's own legacy may have precluded her branching out creatively if indeed she had any desire to do so her popularity afforded her over half a century to hone her skills as a writer . In terms of the depth of her characters Endless Night is the pinnacle of her career . In contrast to her earlier works where a cast of stock characters are carried by a continuous stream of plot twists and in most cases the strong central character of Poirot or Miss Marple Endless Night gives us characters than can stand on their own . The tragic central figure of Michael Rogers is illuminated by the plot not simply swept along as a piece of it.At heart this story is not a murder mystery but a tragedy . Having purchased enough Agatha Christie books to fill three shelves I mean no disrespect when I say that I am certain that an element of her massive sales lies in the fact that most of her books are not ideal for a second reading at least until sufficient time has passed that the details of the plot have been forgotten . But by 1967 Christie had matured as a writer and gave us Endless Night a novel that resonates all the more deeply upon a second reading . It is no wonder that she listed it among her personal favorites . ",4
"The characters are interesting . Very believable . Hard to figure out their motivation whether he was a good guy or deceitful . The ending was unexpected . ",4
"Endless Night was written late in Christie 's career 1967 yet it is one of the best things she ever wrote . The murder happens very late in the story and Christie 's ability to surprise her audience even after fifty years is as strong as ever . She does reuse old tricks what magician does not ? but her sheer ingenuity is as evident here as in anything she ever wrote and there is an atmosphere of evil about this one that Christie was not always able to create . Not to be missed ! ",4
"That 's what this book seemed to beEndless . It went ON and ON and ON with irrelevant details about the main couples ' relationship . It takes over half this book just for them to get together.This book is NOT Christie 's usual style . This book takes a VERY slow build to an eventual murder that does n't occur until 34 of the way through the book . By that timeyou just do n't care . The supporting characters appear in only brief moments . Much of the action takes place off the page and you just hear about it afterthefact . Some of these things are significant . Christie does a lot of telling and NOT showing in this book which makes it hard to get involved in . The narrator is just reciting everything in his recollection.This is also one of Christie 's last books and you can definitely tell . Her writing style and format is completely different in this book . She does n't just stick to the facts and keep the story moving . Insteadshe 's always up inside the main character 's mind constantly telling us what he 's thinking and feeling and NOT keeping the story rolling along . It 's almost like she was trying to match the literary style of more contemporary writers of the time1960 's & 70 's . It does NOT work . I admire any artist for trying something new but she needed to stick with the style she does best intro of suspects murder investigationwrap up.I love Christie but I can not recommend this book . It 's not big but I kept putting it down and it took me weeks to finish it . If you want a great psychological mystery from Christie go for Sleeping Murder and Toward Zero . These are two of her BEST . ",0
"This is a stand alone novel by Agatha Christie and is one that I had not read before . I have to admit that Christie is undoubtedly my favourite author of all time and whether revisiting favourite characters such as Poirot or coming to one of her books for the first time it always feels as though you are reading something familiar . In fact immersing yourself in a Christie novel is rather like slipping into a warm pool and being taken effortlessly on a journey & # 8211 she is the most capable plotter and absolutely joyous to read.In this book we meet Michael Rogers a rather shiftless young man whose aimless lifestyle is about to change when he comes across the beautiful young Ellie outside a ruined house called & # 8216The Towers & # 8217 but known to local as Gipsy & # 8217s Acre . Michael had the area in mind for the house of his dreams but does not have the means to build or buy it . However Ellie turns out to a wealthy heiress and before long they have married secretly with the help of Ellie & # 8217s companion Greta . Soon Ellie has commissioned the building of their dream house on Gipsy & # 8217s Acre & # 8211 even though both Michael and Ellie have been warned off by old Mrs Lee who insists that the land has been cursed by gypsies who were turned off the land.From the beginning you feel that something terrible will happen and this is a dark novel with many plot twists and turns and a surprising ending . I am delighted that I finally got around to reading it and that as always Agatha Christie did not disappoint . ",4
"ive always heard about the Agatha Christie novels and maybe the others are better but this one just drug along and I got bored . I will try another of her books though . ",2
"Very different from the other Christie 's I 've read . It is a who done it but without a detective . Very psychological twisted . ",4
"I had n't read an Agatha Christie book is a while and this is different that many of her others . Something about this book reminded me of Patricia Highsmith novels . It 's an interesting book with an interesting ending . Put aside your expectations of how an Agatha Christie book will go and enjoy it ! ",4
"One of the wonderful things about being in a bookclub is you discover hidden gems . I had thought I had read all of Agatha Christie 's books . After all I 've been reading her over 40 years but I have never read this one . If I had not known who wrote this I would have thought Daphne DuMaurier had written it . It had that type of suspense and it did feature a house.I wonder what it 's like to see someone who is evil and be one of the few people to recognize it . This book explores that concept . It 's a lovely story with unveiling that 's not really a surprise but yet is unexpected.I highly recommend this to those who like cozy mysteries written by a true master . ",3
"I have read 30+ Agatha Christie novels and most of them share the same structure1 Murder occurs2 Introduction of main characters one of whom is the murderer3 This one takes up the bulk of the book conversations with characters that reveal different clues.4 Glorious finale where everything is explained and the villain is caught usually with a clever twist that I can not foresee most of the times.And it is always very rational everything has a reason and everybody has a selfserving motive nothing is left to chance.This book however plays by different rules . The story starts with a love affair that goes on and on and more than halfway through the book I had to doublecheck if the author is actually Christie because no one had been killed yet . In itself it was actually quite good the characters were interesting and they even went through some psychological development which is not very typical for AC books . Sadly however the end was somewhat disappointing.Mild spoilers ahead ! First maybe I 'm just picky but the plot device has already been used in an earlier book . I 'm not saying which one but if you have read it 'Endless Night ' might be spoiled for you . Second the main villains were identifiable long before the end especially if you have some earlier experience with Christie 's plots . I kept hoping for a surprising turn that would give me someone else to suspect but this never happened.Also the ending was n't exactly coherent and rational one might argue that it had great psychology that 's a matter of taste . If you have read Leo Tolstoy 's 'War and Peace ' to the very end then you know what I mean . It also voided some of the earlier character development that had been the most interesting part of the book for me.All in all if you look for a nice analytical exercise for one 's mind that her books usually offer it 's a letdown hence my 3 stars.If you are OK with a psychological thriller this book might be for you . However there are many other writers that know the psychological crime genre better so I still ca n't recommend this book wholeheartedly unless you 're specifically interested in everything that Dame Agatha offers .

"This is a stand alone mysterythriller . Agatha Christie brings her characters alive in this pageturner . A meticulously plotted mysterythriller with a surprise ending . Not the usual Christie but great entertainment . ",3
"I actually read this book over 20years ago but felt compelled to write this recommendation since this book was one that I could never forget.I thought it was groundbreaking for the time and left such an indelible mark on me . The style of this book is very different from her previous books and the pace is perhaps slower too but climaxes to a startling and shocking end.The revelation of the schemers and murderer blew me away and left an everlasting impression on the child that I was at the time.I fear reading this one again as the years that have passed may spoil the milieu and tone that I had felt to be such an integral part of this mystery.Hats off Mrs.Christie . You have immortalised yourself . ",4
"I just finished an Agatha Christie and it feels so nice everytime I pick up and finish one of her books . It 's an awesome feeling that knows no bounds.Reading Endless Night was a rollercoaster experience . The title is taken from William Blake 's poem and is as eerie as the story . The action takes place on Gipsy 's Acre a land cursed by the gypsies where deaths and paranormal activities is an everyday routine.Enters a young man Michael Rogers who dreams of building a house there poor to the core in search of his dream being fulfilled . Then he encounters on Ellie a young heiress and falls in love towards his destiny and dream of livinh happily ever after . Butwill their happy life be long lived at the cursed land ? Will they see the dawn of light or be lost forever in Endless night ? Read it and love it the way I did ! ",4

This is just the kind of book I like to get lost in . ",4

"Stella Riley wrote this story in the mid 1980 's . Most of her books are very hard to find . She recently started to release some of her books on Kindle and I read somewhere that the content of this story was extended . My review comes from reading the paperback.It is interesting to note that Ms. Riley was able to mix a time in history that actually occurred some fictitious characters that felt true to the era and also included a romance . It is about a dark time during the English Civil War in the mid1600 's . Politics and religion go headtohead . Everyone is affected from commoners to royalty and needlesstosay it split families and friends.First and foremost the story is thick with documented scenes that actually happened . Miss Riley made this period of time mesmerizing and left you the reader to judge the characters . Lord Digby Justin 's dislikable foe was very real and was the ancestor of Sarah Ferguson Duchess of York and Diana Spencer Princess of Wales . Prince Rupert Fiennes and Lilburne all had their pros and cons . And there were so many others.Ms . Riley is aka Juliet Blyth who wrote THE PARFIT KNIGHT . Though TPK was wonderful ASD had more realism texture and anguish filling the pages . Its scope was very different Justin Ambrose and Abigail Radford spent much of their time away from each other not developing their relationship until months went by . For the first half of the story they are nothing more than acquaintances.But wait ! There is a reason for the buildup . Justin and Abigail 's story finally takes off and it soars . The apprehension pressure and anguish that Abigail went through ! Justin Justin Justin.sometimes I just wanted to knock some sense into him ! I was fretting while I read the last 100 pages . Fretting . Hmmmm I have n't thought of that word in years.This is not a 'clean ' romance but what actually happened is vanilla flavored . Abigail 's older brother and sisterinlaw are rotten to the core . They are the villains in the story more so than Justin 's enemies that he was fighting.A SPENDID DEFIANCE is all about tidbits of reality saturated with fabricated and nonfictitious characters . The plot had a slow pace and Justin is not always likable even though he had good intentions . It is a complicated story with layers Ms. Riley excelled at bring the medieval times to life . It earned a solid four stars . ",3
"This was a lovely book the kind that draws you in and you find it impossible to put down . Well written with beautifully drawn characters lots of action and a terrific romantic love story.Enemies are n't supposed to fall in love . The chasm between a Royalist and a Puritan during England 's civil war is nearly impossible to overcome yet Justin and Abby do just that . Their path is n't easy or quick but it is a wonderful story to read . I simply love Stella Riley 's writings and I 'm just delighted to have stumbled upon them.The military setting of this book a troop of Royalists holding a castle under siege in hostile territory was reminiscent of Carla Kelly 's books in that both authors convey the desperation and heartaches caused by war but do it in a heartwarming style that is hopeful not depressing . They both excel in creating believable romances that occur despite the hardships of war and if you like Kelly you 'll like Riley.I highly recommend this book and anything Stella Riley has written .

"It 's 1644 and Royalist Cavalier Justin Ambrose has been relegated to duty at the soontobebesieged Banbury Castle . While the Royalists hold the castle for the King the townspeople are solidly Puritan including Abigail Abby Radford . Although Justin originally thinks of Abby in a sisterly fashion their friendship eventually blossoms into something more as England 's Civil War rages around them . Outside forces threaten to part them forever including the religious fervor of Abby 's brother to the dark secret from Justin 's past . Will Justin be able to set aside his past and declare his love for Abby ? Is Abby willing to be the wife of a mercenary soldier traveling from camp to camp ? Can Abby escape her zealot brother 's attempts to marry her to a depraved monster ? Inquiring minds want to know but I 'm not telling . This was a very sweet tale loved the ending ! of two fictional characters set into actual historical events as they are caught up in the midst of a country and people at war with each other . There 's plenty of action treachery passion a Parliamentarian spy with a knack for poison and sparks flying between Justin and Abby although it 's very clean and I had a hard time putting this one down and oooh I want a Justin for my very own . What a man . The only caution I 'd give if you 're new to this period and not very familiar with the history I 'd read a few other books first so you 're more grounded on the period Pamela Belle'sWintercombeseries is a great start.Riley 's books are very rare and horrendously expensive but I 'm glad I was able to snatch up a copy reasonably cheap . I originally tried for an ILL and received a note that there was one library left to ask but they would be asking for a $ 15 service charge . I poked around the UK used sellers and got lucky so do n't give up hope keep scouring those used book stores and library sales . Four stars . ",3
"This short story collection contains 12 stories most of them having to do with the supernatural in some way . The most famous entry and one that has no supernatural elements to it is Witness for the Prosecution which was later made into a wellreceived movie starring Charles Laughton . In it a young man is accused of murdering an elderly woman for her money he has an airtight alibi with his mistress but on the witness stand she turns against him . His lawyer has his hands full but finally finds a way to prove his innocence . Other good stories include The Red Signal about a death warning revealed in a s & eacuteance S.O.S about a dusty night table and a scrawled message for help and The Fourth Man about a girl with four distinct personalities . Many of the stories were later republished in a collection renamed after its most famous story Witness for the Prosecution . Fans of Agatha Christie 's typical crime stories might be disappointed with this story collection but there are still some interesting selections in it . ",3
"What 's not to love about a story by this legendary author . It keeps the reader glued to the story . It adds to the large number of Christie works . ",4
"These stories are mainly of the supernatural not Christie 's usual mystery stories although 1 is the origin of her famous play Witness for the Prosecution.Although some tales involve hoaxes and swindles of some kind the rest would not look out of place in Weird Tales the famous 30s magazine . Most of the stories are not well done this genre is not Christie 's forte but are no worse than many stories by others in the same vein . The standout for me was The Call of Wings which was somewhat surreal and hallucinatory . ",2
"I suppose if Mrs. Christie had proceeded in tis direction we might now think of her as the rival of HP Lovecraft instead of the rival of Dorothy L. Sayers . Most of the stories in The Hound of Death involve the supernatural in one way or another the nost striking of them solid entries of horror.And some of these are sufficiently gruesome to remind us of what fans of the contemporary Canadian film director David Cronenberg call venereal horror . I ws reminded of Cronenberg several times while reading this book and I wonder if he was a Christie fan . Bibliophiles will remember that the present volume and another The Listerdale Mystery were not available in the USA until the mid 1970s perhaps to prevent diluting the detection brand of Agatha Christie with harder sorts of writing . And at that moment the addition of so much new gave many their first taste of a Christie whose mind went naturally to madness possession abjection and bodily agony the claims of the body destroying the minds of the afflicted . Was she into Bram Stoker and Dracula ? Certainly a pervasive theme here is the exchange of energiesthe sapping of one and the bloom of another.The title story is like a blend of Lovecraft and Stoker it 's based on a goofy legend of World War I almost impossible to summarize but basically a French convent is protected from Germans raping the nuns by an invisible hound whose silhouette is burnt by lightning into the nunnery walls . And a nun seems responsible a rather simple nunthe least violent and least sexual creature on earth . Christie was much taken by the Joan of ArcLittle Flower trope in which earth is saved by its apparently most insignificant inhabitant . Later on this paradox flowers into Christie 's insistence that one must n't commit suicide no matter how dire one 's circumstances because somewhere far down the road God may need you not to do anything in particular but just to be in a particular place at a particular time a tiny fulcrum to change the world as in Towards Zero Ordeal by Innocence Destination Unknownthe existential 1950s.SPOILERS AHEAD.The Strange Case of Sir Arthur Carmichael might have baffled some innocents in 1920 but today it 's sort of ludicrous so patently obvious is the main situation that in my thrift store copy someone has impatiently scrawled the words He 's a cat upside the second page of the story . Who was that ingenious Frenchman who argued that Christie was writing two novels in one in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd that she very much wants you to know that the ostensible and quite famous Poirot solution is incorrect that the real killer is someone else ? Well I think something similar occurs in The Strange Case of Sir Arthur Carmichael . It 's clear at least to me that the doctors in charge are pinning the terror on the halfAsiatic victim while ignoring the guilt of the actual cat controller the English rose type who comes off quiet and innocentto them but to me she 's Satan in a dress ! Thus the story ends with evil unpunishedwith evil rewarded in fact . Mrs. Christie you had a dark dark mind.The Fourth Man The Lamp The Call of Wings Wireless The Gipsy The Last S & eacuteance gee we could divide these up into the grim comedies like Wireless in which a killer 's plans derail by a touch of the supernatural and the dark romances in which like Christie 's own much later Taken at the Flood a lastminute rescue stops an OK guy from meting a horrible death to the woman he loves . The Mystery of the Blue Jar features a PG Wodehouse golfing nitwit getting his arse handed him by a gang of clever grifters.END SPOILERS.A few genuinely surprising and well structured plot twists appears here and there most notably in the one famous story here Witness for the Prosecution but others are just lame ! Christie kept up her flirtation with horror at least until The Dressmaker 's Doll and perhaps the Grand Guignol setups of the late novels The Pale Horse Halloween Party and By the Pricking of My Thumbs Horror remained a part of her arsenal something to use when she wanted to introduce a red thread among the silver and gold .

"This collection of short stories show that not only was Christie great at mysteries but was great at spooky stories ",4
"The Hound of Death is a change of pace for Agatha Christie and her fans . Unlike her typical Poirot and Miss Marple novels The Hound of Death is a collection of twelve shortstories previously published separately many of which can be found in other Christie anthologies that each have the supernatural as their central subject . Despite this unifying theme the collected stories are still rather disparate divided roughly into those that contain genuine paranormal phenomena and those that are simply crime stories in which delinquents use fraudulent methods to make their victims believe the supernatural is at work.Despite supplying the title for the anthology The Hound of Death along with The Strange Case of Sir Arthur Carmichael and The Last S & eacuteance are atmospheric but rather ambiguous stories to be expected considering these are the ones that deal directly with occultism . Touching upon past lives mysticism and apparitions they are rather vague and openended stories at least for readers who are used to Christie supplying direct answers to her mysteries.To my mind The Fourth Sign is the only story with an occult explanation that really works a chilling story of three men who discuss the strange case of Felicie Bault and her multiple personalities only to be joined by the testimony of an eyewitness who grew up with the girl in question . His story sheds new light on the case as he shares the tale of his childhood in a state orphanage with Felicie and another girl called Annette Ravel the toxic friendship between the two girls and Felicie 's ambition and zest for life even in the face of death.Christie seems on firmer ground when it comes to using her usual techniques of misdirection and red herrings in order to concoct crimes that may or may not be based in the paranormal . In S.O.S a doctor seeks out help in a country house after his car breaks down only to find a strange family inside and a message drawn in the dust of his bedside table . In Wireless an elderly woman is astonished to find that her dead husband 's voice is calling to her over her new radio promising that he will come for her on the coming Friday . The Mystery of the Blue Jar involves a young golfer who can hear a terrible screaming coming from the vicinity of a nearby cottage though no one else can.Defying categories are the remaining stories in which the touches of supernatural are only tangential to the story itself such as The Red Light and The Gispy which deal with premonitions of the future and The Call of Wings and The Lamp which draw more on religious matters as Christie explores life after death and material worth.Finally The Witness for the Prosecution deals with a case that is not only completely devoid of anything supernatural but which never even pretends to . Mr Mayherne takes on the case of Leonard Vole a man accused of murdering his elderly patron in order to inherit her fortune . He swears his innocence and declares that his wife is able to provide an alibi but Mayherne knows all too well that a devoted wife does n't make for a reliable witness in the eyes of the jury . However on visiting her Mayherne is shocked to find that she is not as loyal to her husband as Mr Vole claims and insists that he is guilty of the crime . What 's she really up to ? This story feels a little out of place in this particular compilation and can also be found inThe Witness for the Prosecutionand is of course the inspiration behind the filmWitness For the Prosecution.The Hound of Death wo n't please everyone but for Christie fans it serves as an interesting selection of stories which are quite different from her usual fare but still stylistically recognizable as hers .

"Contents and my rating from to Hound of Death Silly story of a Belgian nun who causes an explosion at her convent when it is overrun by the German army and the doctor in England after the war that attempts to exploit her gift . Plotline unworthy of Christie.The Red Signal A discussion about premonitions at a small dinner party leads to one guest surmising another is at the dinner to assess one of them for possible inherited insanity . Maybe I 've read too many Christie stories but it was predictable and not that interesting.The Fourth Man During a train ride three men who know each other are discussing a case of supposed multiple personalities when a fourth man in the compartment tells them that he actually knew the person and recounts his story . OK but not remarkable short story.The Gipsy A young man tells a friend about his recurring nightmare and subsequent fear of gipsies then meets a woman at a dinner party that reminds him of the gipsy in his dream and she warns him of something that comes to pass . OK story about second sight and coincidences.The Lamp fairly straightforward ghost story well told about a woman who rents a longvacant house where former tenants heard the pitiful sobbing of a child.Wireless an elderly woman with heart problems takes in a nephew as a companion and he tries to lift her spirits by bringing in a newfangled wireless set to help her pass the long evenings when he is away.Witness for the Prosecution unless you have been on Mars or are under 30 in which case you probably are n't about to read Agatha Christie you must know the plot twist in this story about a young man accused of murdering an elderly woman for her money . If you do n't know the twist see the fantastically effective movie before reading the story.The Mystery of the Blue Jar a man obsessed with golf hears a cry of murder ! at exactly the same time each morning on a golf course but others in the vicinity do n't . A professional man he meets agrees to help him unravel the mystery which may involve a nearby cottage reputed to be haunted . Nicely told and I did n't expect the twist at the end.The Strange Case of Sir Arthur Carmichael a dead cat seems to haunt the home of a widow and her stepson who seems to be particularly influenced by the feline 's presence . Not well thoughtout or executed story that made little sense.The Call of WIngs a millionaire is strangely affected by the music he hears played by a crippled street musician . Not very convincing story of mania.The Last Seance drained from years of acting as a medium a woman plans one last sitting to help a mother communicate with her dead child but things do n't go as expected . Nice little story that 's not scary but has an unexpected ending.SOS stranded out in the boonies when he car breaks down a man seeks refuge in a cottage and discovers most of the family there acting strangely . He is determined to discover why after he finds the letters SOS in the dust on a desk in the room he is sleeping in . OK story that in the end does n't make much sense . ",2
"Trying her hand at writing into occultism and supernatural subjects Agatha Christie failed to provoke new insights nor deliver any entertainment value.Several stories were outrightly occultic such as the Hound of Death . These have got nothing to do with crimes.A couple of other stories such as the Blue Jar have some crime involved and could be considered readable.What mystery and crime readers would normally expect from Agatha Christie was a thorough investigation of the paranormal sifting the clues and evidence and exhaust all possibilities before leaving it as unexplainable by known facts . Had Agatha Christie done that the stories would have been much much more readable . ",1
"What a wonderful collection of short stories . These are very different from Agatha Christie 's normal fair ! All the stories seem to revolve around the occult or other supernatural occurances ! A nice change from what I am use to where Agatha Christie is concerned ! My favorite story was Witness for the Prosecution ! ",3
"I love it . Thomas Perry is a great author . No complaints so far . I should start buying his books on my Kindle . ",4

"The best summer reading imaginable . Buy an old copy now and do n't wait for the silly publishers to get off their butts and reissue it . This is classic Thomas Perry odd violent characters that you come to care about tight plotting touched with wit and irony that make it more believable not less and scenes you 'll remember . I have to say it Thomas Perry has this trick about writing about bad people as if he were their guardian angel and could see how all their decisions and mistakes built up around them and yet left them human not sweet but somehow compassionate and it balances the violence and the pratfalls . Oh well take my word for it there 's a grace to his writing that lasts after the great entertainment is over . ",4
"ExcellentThis review requires that I write ten more words . Word word word word word word word word word word . ",4
"It took some searching to find this book online . I read it twice because it did n't 'stick ' in my pea brain the first time through too many distractions at the time . This story had a slow start but I liked the way it built and evolved . The characters were forgettable . I 'm glad Perry did n't stick with them for subsequent storylines . The Big Fish tale is not up there with the Jane Whitefield series but a worthwhile read nevertheless . I passed it along on paperbackswap.com and I hope it is still making the rounds as it is out of print . ",3
"This is Perry 's third novel and it 's a bit of a disappointment after his first two . Altmeyer is a Los Angeles businessman if supplying mostly illegal weapons to almost any government corporation or individual with the money is a business and his lovely wife Rachel helps out wherever she can . Their friend Bucky is a bigdeal Hollywood agent whom they help to escape from a dangerous drug deal by killing off the other side . The early parts of the narrative are rather disjointed and episodic they do n't seem to have much to do with each other rather than to introduce the characters . Then a shipment of 9millimeter automatics to Japan goes wrong and it does n't look like Altmeyer is going to get paid but that 's not the half of it . The Really Bad Guys were interested not in Altmeyer 's guns but in his international shipping methods which they adopt for their own use . And what they 're shipping from one country to another appear to be terroristsized nuclear devices . Here the story gets more interesting the three main characters being joined by a legendary film producer with all the right contacts . The plot is still a bit fuzzy though and Perry should have spent more time tidying it up . Not up to his previous work . ",2
"Let me tell you a little about my week . I 've been working long hours getting low pay and even less recognition . In the evenings I worked out and ate poorly . To relax I tried to read Jane Smiley 's Moo.Normally I read a book every couple of days . I 've been slogging through Moo for weeks . I 'm not sure whether it 's exhaustion or lack of interest but the fact is I was bored and frustrated.But then I found Big Fish by Thomas Perry . I 'd known this novel existed for years but have never been able to find a copy . I loved the author 's Metzger 's Dog and The Butcher 's Boy and was intrigued . I opened to the first page just to get an idea of the style and the next thing I knew three hours had passed and I was done.Big Fish is the story of two charming relatively smalltime gunrunners who become embroiled in a plot to control the world . I wo n't tell you how or why because that 's part of the fun but I will tell you that along the way they collect a Hollywood agent and teach him to be a commando and a Hollywood director and teach him to be a human being.The writing is crisp and clean with no words wasted on unnecessary exposition or description . Perry in fact is reminiscent of Gregory McDonald at his most terse and entertaining but can be more goofy and relaxed.This book was just what I needed to get the taste of the week and Jane Smiley out of my mouth . It 's out of print which is disappointing but I bet you can find it used or at a library . And who knows as Perry 's recent books become more mainstream Big Fish just might be republished . ",3
"An early Thomas Perry book an easy read worth the effort . You can see how in this early book he established his genre . ",2
"One of the longest VH 's I 've read . It 's too long meandering in fact with too many locales and no big mystery to tie it all together . At least it does n't dwell on the heroine 's childhood . She 's a young adult and soon married . Clearly she did n't get my memo from an earlier VH review that when the heroine marries before page 50 hubby has the average life expectancy of a fruit fly.Sure enough the marriage goes sour . At first all is magical in romantic Venice during their honeymoon . But one night hubby comes home and rips her bodice . The heroine is horrified by rough sex and falls out of love with hubby . Kind of . Seriously VH 's nographicdetails writing style and firstperson POV was a real disadvantage here . Without knowing what happened we 're left to scratch our heads as to what hubby actually did . With no info the heroine comes across as an overwrought Victorian prude who 's horrified at the notion of taking off her flannel nightie for sex.Hubby turns out be an opium addict and fulfills his destiny of an early death . I was surprisingly sad at the waste I guess . Not as sad though as at spoilr the death of their child . Warning here if you 're sensitive to reading about that ! The stricken heroine develops a bizarre fixation with the doctor who she feels led her husband into drugs and neglected her child . She dwells and dwells on his guilt without the slightest proof and calls him the Demon Doctor endowing him in her mind with devil horns and cloven feet yet.Naturally he turns out to be the hero . Sans cloven feet I assume . But before we get to that there 's a long section of the heroine training to be a nurse interacting with way too many supporting characters that I could n't care about and finally traveling to the Crimea . All the while brooding on the Demon Doctor and her revenge . There are some nice historical touches about the Crimean war and the poor state of medical care but this section just goes on way too long.Finally around the 250 page mark the hero shows up . And I was underwhelmed . Seriously he would have to have superman ability or cloven feet to live up to all the build up . But he just turns out to be a gruff but dedicated doctor who happens to be interested in Eastern drugs and hypnotic techniques that might help the suffering men in his care . Of course heroine continues to rage against him in her fevered brain while her body is mysteriously falling for him natch . Of course the fool heroine is nearly caught by white slavers in the Mysterious Orient and has to be rescued by the hero 's sidekick . Giving her an opportunity to berate the hero for lounging around in Eastern clothes like some pasha with a harem At this point I got the feeling the heroine needed to get laid . Fast.So the Demon Doctor turned out to be rather a disappointment . I expected more charisma more saturnalia is that a word ? more something . But what really ticked me off was when apparently not knowing the heroine 's identity he blames the wife of his young friend hubby # 1 for leaving him after their child 's death and letting him fall prey to drugs instead of staying and saving him . WTF ? As if anyone can save a druggie from his drug ! And he never apologizes for this gross accusation later . And the heroine never calls him on it later . Blargle ! I was left with the feeling that all along this story was headed for an explosive confrontation between a revengeseeking heroine and a possiblyevil hero . But sadly that never materialized after all the build up leaving us the readers with a damp squib . And no climax . Blargle again . ",2
"When I red the synopsis for this book I thought I should n't read it because I thought it would be too into the occult and as a Christian that would n't b something for me to read . Some other Christians read it and did n't say anything bad about it so I thought I would give it a try . I 'm glad I did ! Do n't be frightened ! The occult is just mentioned and is frowned upon . It is all right for a Christian to read ! Susanna grew up in India but went to school in England . On her return visit she finds Aubrey St. Clare It is a man ! I 've known girls named Aubrey but this one is a man ! . They fall in love and marry back in England . Her marriage is all but shattered when she finds out Aubrey is into opium and the occult . She tries to make the marriage work but when Aubrey 's way of life causes her son to die she leaves forever . Before she regrets it Aubrey dies as well.She decides to leave England and become a nurse but she never forgives Dr. Damien Adair the man she blames for Aubrey 's downfall and her son 's death . Much to her surprise she meets up with Damien and is it love ? Could she love the man that ruined her husband and son ? This Victoria Holt book is different because the ending is n't very suspenseful and the badguy is n't trying to hurt the heroine . Still it is very good like her others . ",4
"I just could not get into this book and as this is not the first V. Holt book I 've read I think I will just not like her writing style.It was just that I could not feel what the character was feeling . The story is told from the first person point of view and instead of that making her emotions more vivid to the reader the narrator seemed to take a detacted voice to everything . I did not feel her hatred for the Demon Doctor though Anna said she hated him there was never any real sense that it was true . When she fell for him I did n't feel the passion . I could n't even feel her passion for nursing . I know they were all there but just because she said they were and her actions vaguely reinforced it . There was never any real action in the story either . There was never a confrontation or a real climax.The story was n't written badly and the idea of the story was good too . There just was n't that something extra in the story to make it great.All in all the story did n't make me cry laugh angry passionate or even content . I was just indifferent to the characters and I would frankly prefer to hate a book or its chacaters then at least I know it touched me somehow . ",2
"if you 've never read a victoria holt book than this one you would love it is the 12th victoria holt book i read ",4
"This is one the few books written by Victoria Holt that I 've absolutely hated . Though Holt 's writing is not formulaic she does have a predictable pattern that I love intelligent but beleaguered heroine an interesting backstory a shadowy hero or two and verbal wit not to mention plenty of intrigue and lovely settings . Secret for a Nightingale is the story of Susanna who grows up to become a nurse during the Crimean War after a horrible marriage . Holt 's attention to detail is present as is her usual intelligent and independent heroine the mystery is somewhat interesting but the socalled hero is not . Susanna 's driving force to do good and succeed on her own is to get away from her bad marriage and the memory of her dead husband 's opium addiction . However the hero of this story is the man who led her husband astray and horrifyingly enough he spends most of the book convincing Susanna that her husband 's weakness was all her fault ! What 's worse is that she believes it and she is frequently overcome by her strong attraction to the hero . I read on to the end because I hate not completing a book but I closed the pages not with a sigh of enjoyment but with a grimace filled with disgust . ",1
"This romance centers on the life of Susanna the rather sheltered daughter of a widowed British colonel stationed in India . After her education in England Susanna returned to her father in India but soon found romance with the charming wealthy heir to a country estate 'back home ' . Soon after her marriage Susanna realized that her husband was addicted to drugs and that a well known doctor and author was involved in his circle of drug taking friends . When Susanna can endure no more of this life she leaves her husband a shocking action in Victorian society and becomes involved with the equally shocking Florence Nightingale . Susanna 's path leads her to Germany and then the Crimean War theater . Along the way she learns not only nursing but to question long held beliefs about her society and herself.As is typical of Ms Holt 's work romance abounds in exotic locations . Although the plot is rather formulistic and the mysteries quite transparent and the happy ending obvious from the beginning it is an entertaining way to spend a few hours . ",3
"I adore Victoria Holt novels . I like the author in all her pen names . But the books attributed to Victoria Holt have always been superior to the rest . They are usually well constructed with an engrossing plot full of mystery strong lead characters and a powerful sense of place . Secret for a Nightingale lacks all of the above . It is the first Holt book I 've been utterly unhappy with.The plot is as thin as mountain air thinner . It surrounds a young woman who quickly discovers her new husband is not only an opium addict but a proud selfprofessed devil worshipper . Tragedy destroys her marriage and she forms a bizarre fixation on the man she 's decided to blame a wellrespected doctor and author of several provocative books about his exotic travels . Without any real legitimate factual reason she forms a personal vendetta against him.She is soon joined by not one but three random young girls she passively takes under her wing . The scenarios surrounding these friends are farfetched in the extreme.The story meanders and plods along . Despite being tangentially important to the action Florence Nightingale is only talked about she has zero presence in the story . In fact nursing in general has little presence . It 's merely a vehicle for the heroine to enjoy in coincidence after coincidence the waytooeasy hunt for her sworn enemy dubbed The Demon Doctor.The love story is usually secondary to the mystery for me in Holt 's Gothic novels . But there is no mystery here . Sharp readers will be shocked and annoyed at the transparency . Nor is there the classic housecastleislandvillage full of unknowns.The setting jumps all over and one never really gets a good grasp on any one place.The most farfetched and badly fleshed out feature of the mess is the love story . Even as you see it coming from chapters away the narrative fails to deliver a plausible development.The more I think about it the more ludicrous this novel becomes . From start to finish it lurches and sways like a drug addict ending abruptly but not leaving the reader craving more.Instead of this junk I highly recommend Night of the Seventh Moon The Judas Kiss The Secret Woman and The Shivering Sands . Holt can be masterful with the Gothic romance genre . Here she faltered . ",1
"This book is my second favorite of Victoria Holt 's my first being The Demon Lover . Her books are quality romancemysteryhistory which are hard to find these days . This book realistically portrays the struggle of a nurse durring WWI not just with her nursing duties but with her immense personal struggles as well . ",4

"Sidney Sheldon is one of my favorite authors and you wo n't be disappointed . This is a great book and one you should n't miss . ",4
"It is a great read ! It was hard to put it down I recommend it I love Sidney Sheldon 's books ",4
"Sidney Sheldon is always a good read . This is probably the 2nd time I have read this book Most of his I have read 2 ormore times . ",4
"This was the first novel I 've read by Sydney Sheldon . The character development plot development and prose is drivel compared to books by Greg Iles Joseph Finder Nelson DeMille Richard Crais Michael Connelly Sheldon Siegel and Richard North Patterson . Its so bad I 'm throwing the book out so I wo n't make the mistake of rereading it . Raise your standards people ! ",0
"Sidney Sheldon remains as one of the few writers who really know how to move a story keep his readers absorbed and root for a protagonist . He was skillful at constructing a complicated plot and had the main storyline intertwined with the numerous side stories . I also like how the author was comfortable with writing about any time place or setting . He adapted to them all very well as any good writer would.He also knew when to throw a twist at a reader . Sometimes it 's comes as a pleasant surprise sometimes you could hear yourself say oh this was totally unnecessary.Sidney Sheldon 's books are soap operas wrapped in the paperback or hardcover . He adroitly strikes chords and rattles reader 's nerves . His novels are what critics typically call an absorbing fastpaced pageturner . However if you read more than one of his novels you will notice couple things.First he never bothered with complex descriptions of physical appearances . His characters are all goodlooking men have arresting and sharp glance and a determined chin . Women are all with soft silk sensual bodies voluptuous provocative seductive looks stunning eyes and shrewd personalities . Sometimes Sidney Sheldon got a tinge of inspiration and an arresting look became an arresting intelligent look . But you get the point ? Many writers label this lazy writing . Lazy or not Sidney Sheldon still sold his novels.Second frequently his female characters have a bad first sexual experience . I do n't know what the fascination Sidney Sheldon had with that but their virginity was lost in ohhowIwishitwasdifferent kind of way.And of course here and there Sidney Sheldon gets carried away with complicating a story and inadvertently leaves some holes in the plot . But hey who does n't ? So what does all this have to do with Bloodline ? Well a lot . If everything I wrote above appeals to you then it does not matter if I talk about this book or any other of his books . The review applies to them all . It 's a formula . the book not this review . ",3
"The history behind the book the character descriptions the whole book was a wonderful suspense filled pageturner . One of Sidney Sheldon 's best books . You fall in love with the main characters . ",4
"Interesting and exciting mystery with welldeveloped characters . It 's hard to believe that this is a second career for this author . ",3

"Not Sidney Sheldon 's best could not get in to it will try another later ! All the other books he wrote were great ! ",1
"Sidney Sheldon wrote another book that captivated me . It was hard to put it down . Good reading . I was sorry when it ended . ",4
"The main characters are with two exceptions despicable . The heroine alone is redeemable . Even the hero her choice is shallow and unbelievable . The highly improbable but effective detective is the only other character worth a fig . I am thoroughly disgusted with Sheldon . ",0
"Reading Sheldon 's most recent book Are You Afraid of the Dark reminded me of this the first book of his I read Bloodline . I still consider Bloodline to be his best work definitely in the first order of all thrillers written . It has it all beautiful heroine exotic locales all sort of deviancy to satisfy my prurient and adolescent mind great plot that keeps you guessing great characters great psychology and interesting insights into lifestyles of the rich and famous.Also Bloodline was strangely enough my first great motivational book . I read it not long after it came out in 1979 or 1980 when I was a young teenager . It had an effect on me as a 14yearold that Atlas Shrugged or The Fountainhead might have on a 20year old . The book made me think of what my future would be and whether I would be up to the task of meeting that future headon . That is the book 's greatest strength it describes people facing adversity and succeeding despite myriad obstacles.There is one part of the plot that I must comment on however . A good capital markets attorney even in the 1970s could have resolved the Roffe family 's cash flow problems quite easily . Further bank loans would have been entirely unnecessary . All that was required was to make an offering of common stock to the general public to raise the needed money simultaneously giving the Roffe family shares of preferred stock with the preferred stock tradeable only within the Roffe family . The preferred stock would give the collective holders thereof majority control over the board of directors of the company say four out of seven seats and preference rights to receive dividends . Presto the Roffe family remains in control cash flow problems are solved and the Roffe family taps into some big bucks . The New York Times Company actually has something similar to this allowing the Sulzbergers to retain control while holding only a small proportion of the outstanding stock . See Note 15 of the financial statements to the New York Times Company 's most recent Form 10K . Simple no ? Sir Alec could get the money to pay off the gangsters Ivo could pay off Donatella Walther could afford a nice cushy asylum for Anna and Helene couldwell do something mean and nasty I guess and everyone would be happy no murder or mayhem necessary . But I digress . Read and enjoy the book . It amply deserves a fivestar rating . ",4
"Call it a craze of a Die hard Fan of Sid I find Sid 's Books Interesting Reads that glues to start to finish read . His novels are royal touch that walks one mentally through the series of events that are emotional sensational touchy investigative gripping . Till the end Sid keeps mystery and thats the charm of his novels . Elizabeth the main character of the book inherits her Dad 's Company worth millions of dollars and becomes indecisive what to do . Her emotional character is twined with many other characters in the book like a thriller movie . She has to outwit the unknown assassin who wants her life as Sid passes the reader through betrayal greed danger and killing phase . Sid portrays Elizabeth as intelligent tough daring and beautiful lady . A nice read on a Hot summer day to stay chilled in the comforts of the Reading room with the book . ",3
"This is one of Sheldon 's earlier books and while it 's good I prefer later novels Master of the Game & Doomsday Conspiracy . Apparently this was made into a movie which flopped starring the lovely Audrey Hepburn . I 'd still like to see it.This whodunnit story revolves around Elizabeth who is in control of a hugely powerful international family owned company where someone high up is sabotaging the company & trying to kill Elizabeth they have already killed her father to force the company to release shares to the public . Just about everyone is a suspect & has a motive.Just for the record I was unable to correctly guess whodunnit . Will you be able to guess correctly ? ",3
"It was a very exciting and a fast read ! I 've fast become a fan of Sidney Sheldon . All of these intricate plot points and you were n't sure who the killer was until the very end . I 've read a lot of books and nobody has stumped me quite like Sheldon has done with this one . ",4

Each one has a reason to want Elizabeth out of the way and as the attempts on her life increase the tension mounts until the killer is revealed in a truly frightening conclusion .

It took me a while to get into the book but once I got into it I could NOT put it down ! I was up 'til 130 reading it and considering I 'm 14 that 's quite late on a school night . I have read 5 books by Sheldon now and I plan to read even more . I have really enjoyed all 5 . The Doomsday Conspiracy Nothing Lasts Forever Bloodline Morning Noon & amp Night and The Best Laid Plans were all great books from an excellent author . ",4
"Another fantastic mindgripping read holding its audience from page one . Bloodline spins the tale of a familyrun pharmaceutical conglomerate . Roffe and Sons has been passed down to the heirs of Samuel Roffe 's family Sam Roffe the only male descendant and holder of the controlling interest of the company Anna Roffe married to Walther Gassner Ivo Palazzi married to Simonetta Roffe Charles Martel married to Helene Roffe and Sir Alec Nichols ' mother had been a Roffe . Samuel Roffe founder of the company had decided from the beginning that his company never go public . His theory Never let a friendly fox into your hen house . One day he 's going to get hungry . When Sam Roffe an experienced climber dies in a mysterious mountain climbing accident Elizabeth inherits his controlling interest in the company . Suddenly lifethreatening events begin to happen to her as she holds onto her greatgreat grandfather 's wishes after finding a book telling the story of Samuel Roffe 's life and the tense emotional and physical struggle he endured to build the company from the ground up . In her greatgreat grandfather 's memory and approach she is determined to keep the company private and uncover the person responsible for the evil doings within the upper echelon that being one of four of her cousins or possibly her father 's righthand man Rhys Williams . Rhys not being a member of the family was brought into the company by Elizabeth 's father however unless he married a Roffe in this case Elizabeth since she was the only female left would be unable to sit on the Board of Directors . Williams was always kind to Liz is it merely business or personal ? who grew up without a father 's presence in her life just the comforts of his money . Liz felt even though she harbored strong feelings for Rhys she could not afford to trust him or anyone until she uncovered the person out to destroy all that Samuel Roffe had built . Each cousin has their own issues Anna Roffe 's husband is out to destroy their children Ivo Palazzi is leading a double life with two families Charles is being lead around by Helene as a boy toy Sir Alec has married Vivian a wild crazy party girl and Rhys has worked long and hard his adult life for Sam without the benefit of even a share of stock in the multimillion dollar business . Each one has their own agenda for forcing first Sam and now Elizabeth to have the company go public and thereby attaining the financial means to destroy the fly in the ointment of their respective lives . I could not put this book down until the last page was turned . Sheldon is the master of storytelling . ",3

"Elizabeth Roffe a beautiful 20something woman becomes owner of a huge corporation when her father Sam dies in an accident or was it a murder ? . She quickly finds out that someone is trying to ruin the whole corpration and it 's up to her to find out who.Despite the length the book reads VERY fast and is never dull . There 's so much happening that keeping track of it all can be confusing but u get up to speed quickly . The characterizations are paperthin the plot has HUGE loopholes and reality totally disappears a few times especially at the end . Still I 'd be lying if I said I was n't entertained and kept reading . This is not a good book at all but it 's perfect for the beach or to read when you 're in the mood for something trashy and fun . Be warnedthere is plenty of sex and violence mixed together but it 's hard to take this seriously . Very much a guilty pleasure . ",3

"'McAuslan in the Rough ' a collection of seven short stories recounts tales of service in a Scottish Highland regiment after WW II in North Africa and later back home awaiting demobilization.The narrator is a young subaltern by the name of Dand MacNeill who has the dread luck to suffer McAuslan 's presence in his platoon . To explain the extent of this misfortune I can do no better than offer three short excerpts that paint the picture . Turning up to caddy in a match against a set of English officers McAuslan 's greywhite shirt was open to the waist revealing what was either his skin or an old vest you could n't tell which . His hair was tangled and his mouth hung open altogether he looked as though he 'd just completed a bellringing stint at Notre dame . McAuslan in the Rough.Later McAuslan demonstrated yet again his carelessness negligence and indiscipline and at the same time his fine adherence to principle . His Majesty says goodday.Not that he was a bad sort in his leprous way but he was sure disaster in any enterprise to which he set his grimy hand . Bo Geesty.The McAuslan stories appear to be at least semiautobiographical both with regard to MacNeill and McAuslan . According to Wikipedia Fraser was busted back to private from Lance Corporal on three occasions once for losing a tea urn but later achieved a commission and served as a lieutenant in the Gordon Highlanders . Fraser also wrote an actual autobiographyQuartered Safe Out Here A Recollection of the War in Burma.Fans of Flashman Flashman A Novel Flashman will be thrilled to learn that there are more Fraser 's works to be read . Mawe no mistake McAuslan is no Harry Flashman . Nonetheless McAuslan does grow on the reader but MacNeill would probably say it 's a fungus that may not be easily cured and should be looked after right away.Highly recommended . ",4
"I enjoyed this book for what it is a light read based on GMF 's military days . As a former military officer I could see the events occurring and unfolding just as GMF described them . Every platoon or company has a soldier in the mould of PTE McAuslin . I think that 's why I enjoyed the book . I suspect that a nonmilitary person would not get the same benefit out of reading it as an ex military . ",2
"MCAUSLAN IN THE ROUGH is George MacDonald Fraser 's 1974 sequel to THE GENERAL DANCED AT DAWN . In the former Dand MacNeill continues to reminisce about his time spent as a subaltern commanding a platoon of tartankilted Scottish Highlanders during the period 19451947 while the battalion is posted to both Libya and Edinburgh . One of MacNeill 's Jocks is Pvt . John McAuslan by consensus the filthiest most unkempt soldier in the British Army . As Dand records his greywhite shirt was open to the waist revealing what was either his skin or an old vest you could n't tell which . His hair was tangled and his mouth hung open altogether he looked as though he 'd just completed a bellringing stint at Notre Dame.Each of Fraser 's books is a collection of short stories relating to events experienced by Dand and his battalion and particularly his platoon and which are based on Fraser 's own service in the Gordon Highlanders during the same time period . So in this volume the lieutenant and his comradesinarms garrison an isolated desert outpost for a month face the controversial inclusion of a black piper in the regimental band it is after all 1946 compete in a general knowledge quiz contest with the Fusiliers regiment contemplate McAuslan 's dubious success with the ladies mount a nighttime raid on the local Souk to apprehend two deserters and engage the Royals regiment in a golf tournament . And lastly what happens when Dand and McAuslan are released from active duty demobbed on the same day . Whereas in GENERAL McAuslan 's contribution to events was erratic and usually of brief duration in ROUGH his role is expanded to the point where he 's a key player in four of the seven chapters . As always MacNeill 's first person narration both witty and goodnatured ties it all together.Note MCAUSLAN IN THE ROUGH is currently out of print in the US . However it and Fraser 's two other books in the McAuslan series THE GENERAL DANCED AT DAWN and THE SHEIKH AND THE DUSTBIN are all contained in THE COMPLETE MCAUSLAN . I found this to be a captivating and entertaining volume which I heartily recommend to anyone who is a student of the British military 's former role in establishing and policing the Empire . One notable characteristic of Fraser 's writing is his ability to quote Dand 's Jocks and put their heavily accented Scottish dialect on paper . By the end of the book I could actually understand what was being said . ",4
"This collection of semiautobiographical stories shows Fraser at his best freed from the need to construct fiction around his Flashman character and hence allowed to bring on a rich cast of wellremembered characters from his youth . The camaraderie of an Army regiment is beautifully drawn as are the tensions which exist inside any closelyknit group of people.But the stories dominate this book from the tense interregimental quiz to the chaotic attempts to prevent a smallpox outbreak and the tourdeforce in which all of the main characters find themselves involved in a golf match the tension increased by the smallness of the stakes for which they are playing.All the characters from mysticalthinking padres from the Western Isles to Glaswegian ruffians and Sandhursttrained exquisites play their part in one of the most enjoyable and amusing collections of short stories it is possible to imagine .

"Guilty of a good read . I 've read of Eleanor of Aquitaine only in a nonfictional context and it was very very very long and boring . I was hoping that this was going to be better than my first introduction to her I was very satisfied.This book is long . I will admit that but it 's not the sort of long that makes you wish you picked something shorter . Though is can be very repetitiousand I 'm noticing that a lot with her books the book goes through her life as a good pace to where you feel you know more of her than just what the history books say or rather don't.It begins with her life at her grandfather 's courts . A place filled with music song and love . In fact her grandmother was abducted by her grandfather in a story that makes for a very romantic story in and of itself . She knows that she is supposed to be Duchess of Aquitaine when her father dies and her dreams are nearly dashed with the birth of her brother . As history tells us she does become Duchess . From almost the moment of her birth she is destined to be great . Eleanor knows it and does everything in her power to fulfill destiny.But her destiny is filled with hardship . She married Louis VII . A pious man who should n't have been king but for a pig . He does love her and she does love him but they should never have been married . He 's too pious for her she too wordly for him . They do embark on the Second Crusade which ends in near disaster but for Eleanor tasting true love . Unfortunately it 's her uncle and that would be totally unacceptable . She 's forced to go back to France where she desperately wants a divorce from Louis.She is given her wish and falls in love with Henry Plantagenet aka Henry II . Their marriage is truly interesting . They would have been happy together if he were n't a cheater and this breaks her heart . She resents him but can not resist him . She bears him many children . Her favourite being Richard also known as Richard the Lionhearted of Robin Hood fame along with the evil Prince John . And he is just as awful in this book as you would expect . Though you sort of understand where he 's coming from . Well at least she tries to convey her reasoning behind his sadistic nature.The book ends with her is a state you never would have thought she would be in.This gives a wonderful account of her life that 's so much better than a history book . She finally gets to come alive from the dusty pages of a book . ",3
"I 'm a big fan . This is a classic plaidy novel . Eleanor of Aquitaine is beautifully de eloped as a character . A rather interesting perspective of this very elusive woman . ",3
"This book was really long and tended to ramble a bit but it was surprisingly insightful and a fun read . Plaidy is so descriptive that you ca n't help but see the scenes before you and her characters are believable . This book chronicles Eleanor 's life as a young girl in France all the way until the end of her life when she 's very old and reflecting upon her life and her children . ",3
"This is a wellwritten account of the life of Eleanor of Aquitaine . The character development is very good and I found her to be an interesting character . She lived a very diverse lifestyle and so this book is packed full of all the different and exotic places she went to . The account of the Crusade was particularly interesting to read.Just a note I am pretty sure this book is the first three books of Jean Plaidy 's Plantagenet serious in one book . The first book was about Eleanor the second book about Eleanor Henry II and Thomas Becket and the third book about Eleanor and her son Richard the Lionheart . This one book covers all three aspects . ",2
"This is a fictional novel about Eleanor of Aquitaine written in her own words.From her childhood in France her marriage to Louis the Crusade marriage to Henry her sons her imprisonment release and her love of her son Richard and hatred of John this book tells everything about Eleanor . ",4
"In this the fifth volume in her Queens of England series of novels the author also known as Victoria Holt to her legion of fans tackles the story of Eleanor of Aquitaine a woman who led an incomparable life . Born in an age when women tended to be submissive and docile Eleanor was anything but . She was an outspoken well educated independent and beautiful woman . Hers is a story that in the hands this author an accomplished storyteller captivates the reader.Eleanor Duchess of Aquitaine became Queen of France when she entered into a marriage of state with Louis VII of France a somewhat weak and ineffectual though pious young ruler . Theirs was not a passionate affair of the heart but rather a mesalliance that would come to a somewhat abrupt end when she met Henry II the first Plantagenet King of England . Though she was eleven years his senior theirs was to be a tempestuous and passionate lovehate relationship that would end in marriage and span a lifetime . She would give birth to their numerous sons and daughters two of whom would go on to reign over England Richard the Lionhearted and John Lackland.Narrated in the first person as are all the books in this Queens of England series Eleanor tells the reader of her adventurous and exciting life set against a backdrop of medieval politics intrigues and strife . A woman who brooked little interference in her life she decribes what it was like to have experienced and gone on a crusade . She tells of her long years as prisoner of her philandering husband Henry II . She relates the triumphs and disappointments of her long and singular life . In doing so she weaves a memorable tapestry of love passion betrayal and heartbreak . It is an account that will keep the reader turning the pages of this unforgettable though somewhat romanticized account of a life lived to the fullest . ",3
"Eleanor of Aquitaine is one of the most fascinating women in all of history and many books both fiction and nonfiction have been published about her . Jean Plaidy 's Courts of Love came as something as a surprise because curiously it lacks the vitality of most of her other historicals . The facts and events of her remarkable life are accurately presented but Eleanor in reality a woman of action here comes across as a judgmental petty rather selfish individual who is extraordinarily hard her husbands . Courts is also exceedingly repetitious . Eleanor makes the same points so often ie what a ninny Louis of France is what a boorish oaf Henry is how taxing her imprisonment is that the narrative becomes tiresome at points . With judicious editing this novel could have been much livelier not to mention shorter.Plaidy is good with words and that 's what saves Courts of Love . Is it worth reading ? Yes . But for a reading experience in which all of the indomitable Eleanor 's amazing resilience talents and vitality are portrayed try The Book of Eleanor by Pamela Kaufman . Also give a look to The Lion in Winter with Peter O'Toole as Henry and Katherine Hepburn who else could play Eleanor ? . A young Anthony Hopkins appears as one of the sons . ",2
"Eleanor of Aquitaine is the granddaughter of the Duke of Aquitaine an extremely wealthy European province . As an heiress she is an excellent catch for a royal marriage and so she was married to Louis VII of France . However the two were not well suited and when Eleanor meets Henry II of England she quickly falls in love . She divorces Louis and moves to England to be with Henry . Unfortunately Eleanor seems not to be any better at picking her mates herself than she was when her marriage was arranged the fire of love with Henry also fades and Eleanor 's new great love is that of her children . Her favorite Richard who will one day earn the Lionheart.Quote I was a woman who considered herself their equal and in many ways their superior but it seemed that I depended on them while seeking to be the dominant partner an attitude which could hardly be expected to bring about a harmonious existence.Eleanor of Aquitaine was cool . This book will tell you why . She is the queen of two countries rules Aquitaine in her own right goes on crusade and is the mother of two English kings . Many of her children are involved in various plots and schemes which Eleanor tries to navigate through often adding intrigue of her own . I really enjoyed this look at Eleanor 's life particularly how the different relationships she had influenced so much of who she became even as she worked hard to be in control of her own destiny . The sections on the crusades was especially interesting as you see the enthusiastic crusaders including the king queen and noble men and women just going for the fun of it learn the truth about war and hardship .

"A thrilling account of the complicated life of Eleanor the mother of Richard the LionHearted and John I of England . I should have looked up a map of Europe first to find Aquitaine . It was a vassal country to France located in the far southwest corner of France near Spain . Raised in The Courts of Love with some very sexcentered grandparents Eleanor became the Duchess of Aquitaine but at a young age she was married to the King of France . She was a lusty girl but Louis was not a lusty man . As the second son he was slated for the church and had to be recalled from his monastery when an accident with a pig caused the sudden death of his older brother . As Louis preferred to spend the nights kneeling beside the bed in prayer Eleanor was extremely frustrated alone in her cold bed but the couple did manage to produce two daughter the second was conceived when the Pope put the couple to bed in a specially prepared room and bed sprinkled with Holy Water . Since girls could not inherit the French crown a divorce was agreed upon on the grounds that Eleanor and Louis were too closely related.Next stage of the story Very soon thereafter Eleanor and 17yrold Henry son of Matilda heir to the English crown jumped into bed to start a torrid love affair . They were soon married and Eleanor hit it off with Henry 's mother Matilda a formidable woman who had led an army to take the English throne away from Stephen a cousin who being male had usurped the Crown . The civil war ended with a document naming Matilda 's son Henry as the next king when Stephen died . Soon Eleanor former Queen of France was Queen of England . Male heirs were no problem for Eleanor and Henry William Henry Richard Geoffrey and years later John joined the family interspersed with enough sisters to make marriage agreements with most of the monarchs of Europe . As happened with so many royal children William was born sickly and passed away in childhood . Henry became the heir and also became his father 's favorite . The marriage started to crumble when Henry the King brought a bastard son Geoffrey to the nursery and demanded that he be raised with the legitimate offspring . Eleanor now realized by the age of the new Geoffrey that Henry had not been faithful to her from the beginning of the marriage . She began to fall out of love . As the father put all his pride and attention on Henry even having him crowned as the young king during his childhood Eleanor put all her love and hopes on the next son Richard . Richard was a strikingly handsome young man tall well built with reddish blond hair . John was rejected by Eleanor at birth . She was tired of having babies . She was estranged from Henry . She had made Richard her heir in Aquitane . Henry had divided his possessions between Henry and Geoffrey . There was nothing left for John so Eleanor decided he should make the church his career . She got a wet nurse and sent him off to a monastery along with servants and Joanne the sister closest to John in age . The king called John John Lackland because there was nothing to give him . John was a small baby with dark hair and was not appealing to his parents.This is a gripping tale and I will not spoil it for the reader . How does Richard and then later John receive the crown of King of England ? What happens to Henry and Geoffrey ? Is the depiction of Richard and John in Robin Hood correct ? Is Richard worthy of the name Richard the LionHearted ? What happens to Eleanor after she falls out of favor with Henry ? What became of Aquitaine ? How about Luis did he ever have a son ? This story tells all in the vivid manner of Jean Plaidy . This is truly a book you wo n't be able to put down . ",4
"Eleanor was indeed a woman born before her time Pleady makes her come alive in a page turning book of historical fiction . From her early life at the court of the duke of Aquitane thru her marriages and afairs she comes to us as a very real modern woman who was loved by her subjects . ",4
"I really liked this historical novel Jean Plaidy made the fascinating life of Eleanor of Aquitaine come to life . From my own research the novel is as accurate as it can be and I loved the way Plaidy created motivations behind the actions of the historical figures . It was well worth the read . ",3
"After reading the fine reviews already posted by others one doubts whether another review will add much but out of habit near compulsion by now here goes another with an emphasis on reading connections.As did many perhaps most readers of the McAuslan stories I came to them by way of The Flashman series My favorites so farFlashman A Novel FlashmanandFlashman in the Great Game A Novel Flashman . I enjoyed the Flashman enough to give McAuslan a try . Both series are funny relate to historical events and display an ear for language and an eye for detail but could otherwise be written by different authors . The McAuslan stories are told by the reasonable sensible compassionate voice of Lieut . Dand MacNeill and relate the trials of life in a Highland regiment immediately after WW II . In other words MacNeill could hardly be more different from Harry Flashman . The stakes are lower than in Flashman . The McAuslan tales deal with the mundane life of a soldier waiting for demobe and not imperial crises . These stories read just like tales that actually happened and something pretty close to them probably did.McAuslan plays less of a role in the The General Danced at Dawn thanMcAuslan in the Rough but the stories are still a delight to read.The McAuslan stories lie at the outreaches of contemporary humor pretty obscure stuff and the more fun because of it . A great kick in finding works like these is stumbling upon other works of equal merit and obscurity . It 's sort of guided serendipity if you will . Flashman led not only to McAuslan but also to John Biggins ' A Sailor of Austria In Which Without Really Intending to Otto Prohaska Becomes Official War Hero No . 27 of the Habsburg Empire The Otto Prohaska Novelsand toArtemus Ward his book . With many comic illustrations.not sure how the Ward connection occurred . Mark Twain called Ward the greatest American humorist of his day..Highest recommendation and climb out on these other branches . ",4
"As a young Lieutenant in a highland regiment posted to North Africa Fraser recounts his adventures the characters and the essence of the army life he encountered.It is so accurate it took me back to when I was a young 19 year old Lieutenant . I showed it to my father who had been in the army in the 1930s and he spent the whole day laughing.Next to Quartered Safe Out Here Fraser 's book on the Burma Campaign these books are second to none for anyone who wants to understand the rhythms of army life the humor of the barracks and the traditions of soldiering.I ca n't recommend these books more highly !

"George MacDonald Fraser served in the other ranks of the British Army in Burma late in WWII . Commissioned as a subaltern 2nd lieutenant following the Japanese surrender he served as a platoon leader in a Gordon Highlander battalion posted to the Middle East before being demobbed i.e . released from active duty . His experiences serve as the basis for THE GENERAL DANCED AT DAWN initially published in 1970 a first person account by the fictional Dand MacNeill subaltern of a platoon in an unspecified Highland battalion posted first to Libya then to Edinburgh during the period 19451947.THE GENERAL DANCED AT DAWN is a work of wry humor inasmuch as Lt. MacNeill describes the unintentionally comic situations encountered with his Jocks men during garrison life both in Scotland and abroad mostly the latter . The book is actually a series of short stories in which a common thread tying all together besides Dand himself is Pvt . McAuslan the dirtiest most slovenly soldier in His Majesty 's service . As described by MacNeill he lurched into my office even in his best tunic and tartan he looked like a fugitive from Culloden who had been hiding in a peat bog McAuslan may be the focus of a particular chapter as when he is courtmartialed for refusing an order to enter a pillow fight contest to be held during a gathering of the various Highland regiments . Or he may make nothing more than a brief cameo appearance as when he is upbraided by MacNeill for fighting one of the crewman aboard the coastal steamer ferrying the battalion 's soccer team on a roadtrip against the teams of neighboring British commands a fight brought on by the sailor 's comments regarding McAuslan 's unsanitary appearance.The squalid presence of McAuslan notwithstanding the central character of the book is Dand MacNeill whether he 's coping with the unfathomable questions of the officer selection board pressed into command of an overnight troop train from Cairo to Jerusalem through unruly Palestine mounting the ceremonial guard at Edinburgh Castle or taking lessons in regimental piping history from the godlike Regimental Sergeant Major . Dand 's narrative of military service is of such good humor and wit that it 's evident his alter ego Fraser remembers his own time in uniform as an enriching life experience despite the hardships of WWII combat . This positive slant on the book 's theme and Fraser'sMacNeill 's fine sense of the ludicrous make the volume one that I could n't put down . I 've encountered socalled thrillers that were less absorbing.Note THE GENERAL DANCED AT DAWN is currently out of print in the US . However it and Fraser 's two sequels in the McAuslan series MCAUSLAN IN THE ROUGH and THE SHEIKH AND THE DUSTBIN are all contained in THE COMPLETE MCAUSLAN available from Amazon.co.uk . This is a superb volume worth to an Anglophile every pence spent in postage to deliver it across The Pond to The Colonies . ",4
"This collection of fictionalised wartime reminiscences shows a truly great writer firing on all cylinders . With a draining sixyear war just finished the regiment is winding down in North Africa and such is the way of the military that the men must be kept busy on a variety of moreorless useless tasks . These they tackle in a hilariously bumbling way aided to no small extent by the inexperience of their officer who serves as the book 's narrator.They play football well but let the side down with offfield brawls and gambling cause havoc on a night exercise and have trouble with their kilts when presenting to royalty . The title story is a tourdeforce when a crusty whiskymellowed General thinks he can redefine the Scottish dancing tradition by turning an eightsome into a hundred and twentyeightsome with the assistance of Arab cooks and drivers.Fraser proves enormously clever in melding fiction with reminiscence and delivers a book that is essential reading matter for anyone with a sense of humour .

"These wonderful stories written by Fraser when he was an officer in the Gordon Highlanders at the end of the Second World War are priceless . There is much sardonic humor and wit here . The characters come and go throughout the book . Each chapter is a self contained story in itself almost . By far the one character who appears most often is the unhygenic pvt . McAuslan . He seems to do for the Scots what some of the WW2 comic characters like Sad Sack did for the GI 's . The author who speaks through the voice of his nomdeguerre relates many amusing episodes . Some are a little silly at times and the constant unwashed antics of Peking Man McAuslan gets a bit tiring but this does not take away from the quality or humor of the work.I like best when Fraser talks about the regimental history and lore of the Gordons when he 's taking a break from McAuslan . There are some truly wonderful characters and events related here all factual enough and displaying the honors and traditions which existed in old Highland regiments like the Gordons . Fraser is at his best when he talks of these traditions and one can see that he relished his hectic years with this famous Highland regiment.The downsizing of the British Empire and the changes this would wrought in the army as well as the world are the backdrop against which these stories are told . This is not a book about war but about a time when national service was apart of nearly everyone 's life . Some of Fraser 's opinions may not be considered PC for today but this in my opinion adds to the charm of these stories . The war and its aftermath left lasting impressions on those who took part . The Gordon Highlanders are sadly no more having been downsized in 1994 . In this book you will find many funny and amusing tales which made them the fine regiment they once were . Those who have followed Fraser in his Flashman series will find a different style here but equally entertaining in its own right . The McAuslan stories form part of a number of works that were written about the post war years in Britain . Tunes of Glory is another more serious example by Kenneth Kennaway.The McAuslan stories have been recently gathered together into a triology which is not available from Amazon.com in the States . The book can be ordered from Amazon.com.co.uk and is well worth the extra pennies to do so.Here 's to the Gordons ! Long may their memory live ! ",4
"an okay read . Plot was not very exciting nor suspenseful . Characters were not well developed nor likeable . The TV series was 1000 times betterand I usually prefer a book . ",1
"I never saw the new series but recalled that my father watched the original so I figured I should get around to this series . Wow ! I must say that I very much enjoyed this novel & Francis Urquhart is captivating and seriously petrifying . I was all over the place with Mattie but ended up simply pitying her because she wanted to believe up to the very end . Roger was hapless and pathetic but I still hoped he & # 8217d make it but I knew he couldn & # 8217t . Mrs Urquhart gets total points for being just about as chilling a person as her husband . They & # 8217re perfect for one another . I very much enjoyed this one & have to admit that it & # 8217s not often one runs across so memorable a character . I wholly see what all the chatter was about & why an American version of the UK series was done.This was a fascinating & absorbing read . I wish it were available on Kindle but I & # 8217m glad that a raid of the bookshelves at my parent & # 8217s had a copy . There was also a copy of To Play the King so I & # 8217ll have to read that soon . I & # 8217d recommend this one definitely . ",3
"The storyline is as relevant today as it was when originally published 25 years ago . Ca n't wait to read the next book . ",4
"Loved the intrigue but I was shocked by how strong the lust for power can be and the lengths Francis goes to to get it . ",4
"I would give the book a 3.5 rating . I like the first part of the book where Francis Urquhart sets up the British Prime Minister to fail so he could become Prime Minister . The second part of the book where Urquhart obtains victory over his political opponents by exposing their scandals was more ordinary and predictable.I have not seen either the British or American TV series by that name . I did not find the British political system hard to follow . In fact some parts of the book which describe the British system were interesting . In Britain the Prime Minister every week has to go to Parliament and take hostile questions from the opposition party which is something the American president does not have to do . The relationship between the press and politicians seems both friendlier and more hostile in Great Britain than in the US.Some qualities of the book which I liked I don & # 8217t think could directly applied to the US politics . If I were to do an American adaption of the book I would set it in a powerful institution where the players are trying to manipulate to become the head of the organization . In the US we can & # 8217t get the US president fired so we can get hisher position which is what Francis Urquhart does to the British Prime Minister.When the book starts out Francis Urquhart is the Chief Whip which gives him access to information but he is not seen as a major cabinet official . The British Prime slights him and then Francis Urquhart goes after the Prime Minister & # 8217s job . That Urquhart is not perceived as a major player irritates Urquhart but he uses it to his advantage because everyone trusts him.For a while Francis Urquhart in the book is what I might call a likeable bad guy . While condoning what he did it was interesting seeing his manipulations and one felt he was going after people who had slighted him . However at some point in the book Urquhart turned pure evil and lost whatever likeability he had.However that Urquhart becomes a total villain would not stop me from reading the sequels to the book if they were easily available.Also the part of the book after the Prime Minister gets ousted gets to be more conventionalboringdull . I found it hard to believe that all of Urquhart & # 8217s opponents for leadership had such serious personal weaknesses that they would just crumble when these issues were revealed . Some politicians are very successful at surviving incredible obstacles . ",3
"After watching the American version of House of Cards I HAD to read the book that was the beginning of it all . Michael Dobbs ' writing is fastpaced and interesting . I could n't put the book down but hated arriving at the last chapter knowing the book would be coming to an end . I 've ordered two more books by Michael Dobbs from Amazon and ca n't wait for them to arrive . ",4
"I had read Michael Dobbs series on Winston Churchill and enjoyed them very much . Coincidentally I had recently watched the US remake of 'House of Cards ' . Perhaps it was time to read the original story now that my memory of the much earlier BBC version constituted only Urquhart 's face and the climactic scene on the rooftop.About half way through the book I realised how much the art of novel writing has matured along with TV screenwriting in the last few decades . The idea of the book remains clever even brilliant but the contrast between the original plot and the reinterpreting of it in the American series reveals the plot weaknesses of the original . Some measure of suspended belief is required . Rather too much in the case of the original . Could he really get away with it ? Surely not.But for a while it us fun to believe he did . ",2
"It is far more cynical and brutal than the old First among equals which I loved . I think that Dobbs has caught the climate of modern politics but where does this takes us . ",3
"& # 8220Why waste a life in search of an epitaph ? & # 8216Fondly Remembered & # 8217 . Who other than a halfwit has that chiselled above his head ? & # 8221This book caught my eye because I have heard so much about the TV series though I have never seen it.Collecting and trading secrets is s dangerous game and calculating game and no one plays it better than Francis Urquhart . He set his sights on the Prime Minister position and will stop at nothing to have it . Can anything be more formidable than am man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants ? Truth and honor are what drive Mattie Storin every day and what drove her politics and becoming a correspondent . Her conviction is tested to its limits when she stumbles into the web of Urquhart & # 8217s deceit and games. & # 8220Politics requires sacrifice . The sacrifice of others of course. & # 8221As far as political thrillers go it is probably one of the best I have ever read . The book starts a bit slowly for my taste but the writing is solid and I easily connected with the characters . It is a smart book . The plot was fun and dangerous and full of twists and turns . Once I settled in I was captivated until the very end & # 8230 OH ! And the end ? ? ? WOW ! ! ! Now that is how you end a book ! Gripping exciting and dangerously devious !

"A really great Kindle read . Nonintellectual that I am I assumed the original BBC series was a pure TV plot . Only when the American version showed up did I learn that Michael Dobbs was not only a real life person but also an honest to goodness inner member of the Thatcher government.The BBC series was an almost page for page retelling of the three books so if you have seen the series there are not to many surprises in the book . Despite that the sheer beauty of the text makes it a page turner . The only true difference is that in the BBC version after each piece of villainy Ian Richardson would turn sweetly to the camera and in that great oily voice calmly explain exactly what he did and why . These lectures are missing from the book . All is not lost however . Each chapter starts with a pure political reality quote presumably by Francis that takes your breath away.Politics comes from the Greek word Politico which means the mass of people . A Tick is a small bloodsucking creature.The Bible says many times you must forgive your enemies . Nowhere does it ever mention that you must forgive your friends.A true bummer however is that only the first book of the trilogy is available on kindle . This might be explained by the author 's notes that this version of House of Cards is a new edition that has been largely rewritten and reissued in conjunction with the American Netflix version . All was not lost . After a search I was able to find the two remaining parts as used books from Amazon.As an aside if you have not started into the Kevin Spacey remake on Netflix I would recommend you start with the BBC original also available from Netflix . Kevin Spacey is good in his quest for power but Ian Richardson was incredible . You think Walter White is a villain whom you have cheer ? He is n't fit to be in the same room with Francis Uquhart .

"Yes you will enjoy the book . Actually the series was quite close to the book . Anyway it 's a good read and I plan to try another of his books . ",3
"Michael Dobbs has written a wonderful book on politicians and this was on the BBC . House of Cards shows you the behind the scenes of daily manipulationscorruption and greed that goes on . ",3
"This introductory book in the Francis Urquhart trilogy is extremely well written evenly paced and the plot is extremely engaging . . Though it is set in the English political arena I was easily able to understand the terms and hierarchy . It is a tightly woven mystery wrapped in political intrigue . I could liken it to a Shakespearean drama . It is my understanding that the series has been updated from it 's original publication with added characters and topical references . Fans of the American Television version of the story will not be disappointed it is different enough as to be a new story . I will definitely read the next books in the series as I found the characters and story compelling and enjoyable.I received my copy from NetGalley.com in exchange for an honest review . ",2
"No way one can put the book down intrigue scheming and fast paced Dobbs keeps you riveted in every chapter every page every para ",3

"I have come to the conclusion that political dramas are best for me on screen . Having this original story have a lot to do with a government that I am not as familiar with most likely made this a 2 instead of a 3 and that is not the authors fault at all . The story was written well and there were some interesting scenes but I struggled through this book and at times felt it more of a chore to read . ",1
"Michael Dobbs aka Baron Dobbs of the Conservative Party is a member of the British House of Lords . In his various roles in government extending over many years and in many roles including advisor to former PM Margaret Thatcher Conservative MP speechwriter Government Special Advisor and Conservative Party Chief of Staff he is presumably wellplaced to probe the dark corners of British politics . He also worked in advertising lending another interesting perspective to his worldview . His fictional accounting of a Machiavellian series of maneuvers undertaken in an effort to undermine and discredit the serving Prime Minister is the basis for this interesting story.Much of the book revolves around various situations that are peculiar to parliamentary government systems and likely are unique to the UK . In it the cynical and devious maneuvering of Chief Whip Frances Urquhart of the Party destroy politicians devastate lives and ruin careers . There are also a couple of murders . One can infer that the parochial nature of the tale has been transcended there are larger lessons to be learned and a good story to be told.Urquhart 's malevolent nature and cunning political ambitions were apparently catalyzed into action creating a modern day I Claudius tale by an offhand and offensive remark by PM Collingridge to FU in the presence of a senior party official . Revenge was relentless and remorseless . The book concludes with FU 's election as PM and sets the stage for the two book sequels and the two TV series it spawned . Revenge and ruthless cynicism are universal themes . The truth and power of the axiom Knowledge is power is nicely illustrated in this story.The novel is both interesting and wellwritten although the plot is oftentimes predictable and character development occasionally mundane . Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright present a much more interesting and nuanced team than do Francis and his wife Mortima . The Netflix series is also better at dramatic presentation and features more plot intricacies.In Francis Urquhart Dobbs has reestablished and updated the political archetype of the cunning emotionless crafty and manipulative politician one whose prowess was acknowledged by President Obama who supposedly remarked At least he gets something done to which FU might have replied You might very well think that I could n't possibly comment .

"The people in this story of British politics are almost all just awful folks all tearing away at each other with no love no kindiness nothing to relieve the reader of the idea that these politicians are a sorry lot . As are their relationships . The indepth knowledge of the workings of British Politics and also British newspapers is all too perfect in complete details . This was a real experience to read because I know very little of English politics in modern times but it seems to me the Brits have not changed since the Green Dragoon Ban Tarleton was the rep from Liverpool defending slavery and trying to find another war to fight . This is a real and seemingly accurate image of the harshest side of political intrigue in which anyone can be exposed as a sinner for the sake of one man 's need to conquer all . Very absorbing very well written . It was was good for me as the first time I read it back when it was a really great series on tv . ",4
"This book is drier than the wonderful BBC series starring Ian Richardson . But because Michael Dobbs spent years as a journalist covering British politics plot points that are simplified or glossed over in the series are explained in more detail . So I feel like I understand what went on in the TV series more but it 's not as much fun . The book went through some significant changes on the way to the teleplay adaptation . ",2

"House of Cards is the first book in the Francis Urquhart series by Michael Dobbs . Francis is the Chief Whip .

Mattie is a young reporter with a knack for finding out the real story behind headlines . Mattie stumbles across a web of deceit and financial corruption risking her life to reveal the truth.House of Cards is a harsh dark tale of the corruption manipulation and greed in politics no matter the country . Just look at the book cover . The characters in House of Cards are puppets and Francis holds the strings . His unapologetic ambition is unmatched . His initials are FU for a reason.The author Michael Dobbs is a member of the British House of Lords . He is Britain 's leading political novelist and is a senior adviser to Prime Ministers . I 'd say he is a credible source in knowing the sacrifices made and discipline shown in politics . Perhaps this is why most of the content in the novel went over my head . I struggled through the lingo and Parliament references . I stifled many yawns while reading.The international bestseller is too wordy and politicy for my taste . But the Netflix original series show inspired by the novel is a mustsee ! You 'll never view Scandal or The White House the same . I will not read the other books in the series but can not wait to watch the third season . Kevin Spacey is the perfect actor for the role of Francis Underwood still initials FU.Literary Marie of Precision Reviews ",1

"The second in a series of books about the Queens of England this tells the story of Katherine of Valois the wife of Henry V. The story told from Katherine 's perspective starts with her dreary existence in a remote house with her brothers sisters and her father the insane King of France . It follows her through her marriage to Henry V the birth of Henry VI the death of the King and her secret marriage to Owen Tudor which becomes the foundation of the future Tudor dynasty . Jean Plaidy writes wonderful stories with great detail . Her research is impeccable and she depicts the lives of these historical figures in a way that makes them accessible to modern audiences . This story in particular shows the lives these nobles had to leave children raised away from mothers marriage without love and constant warfare . ",4
"I 've been watching Showtime 's The Tudors and I absolutely love that show . So when I was given the chance to find out about how they were started I was excited . This book is also the second in historical order of Plaidy 's Queens of England series.This is a really romantic story that I 'm glad to say did n't make me scream . It was n't sappy and that made me happy.But let 's start from the beginning . Katherine of Valois is a daughter of France of Charles the Mad and Isabeau of Bavaria . Her father being insane scared her when she was younger but she got used to it and even grew to love her father when he was in his sane moment . He truly loved his family and his condition made me feel for him . Her mother however was uncaring and truly unlovable through this whole story . She had other siblings two of which die and that 's truly unfortunate . I do wish I could have found out what happened to her other siblings specifically her sisters . I felt like that was a weird loose end.But as she grows up she is involved with one of the great Kings of England Henry V the victor at Agincourt . She is to marry him and is more than willing to do so to leave behind her most dismal life in the Hotel St. Paul . She truly believes that she 's happy with Henry even though he 's gone much of the time . She gives birth to Henry VI and everyone is happy because she birthed him quickly and he was healthy enough to live past the untimely death of his father.Unfortunately being so young means that he was used by those who wished they could have power themselves his uncle the Duke of Gloucester comes to mind . This eventually leads to civil war for the English nation . This book also contains a prophecy which is fulfilled if you know English history or read her next book The Reluctant Queen.Being that Katherine is French she is viewed with suspicion when Joan of Arc challenges English authority and proclaims Charles VII the rightful King of France and soundly beats the English is a number of battles . She is sent away but from my understanding she also decides to go because she can not raise her son and it 's just easier that way and live in the country . She takes along the Welshman Owen Tudor.The romance starts . They fall in love and decide to marry . This is n't a problem until a law is passed that makes it illegal to marry the Dowager Queen and this law is retroactive apparently . They decide to keep their marriage a secret and do so through about 5 children.Eventually they 're caught and separated eventually leading to Katherine 's death by a broken heart.I loved how she faced adversity with some cunning and skill . Her love for Owen was pure even though she was very repetitive with how much she would hate it if they were caught it was about evern 1012 page it seemed . I also was pleasantly surprised by the way she made Joan of Arc and Henry V seem as if they 're just normal people and normal events . We know of them in greatness but then they were just doing what came naturally.Everyone knows of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I but they do n't know of their honestly wonderful beginnings . This is a story that should be told more often . ",3
"First of all I hate being required to write remarks when I rate something . Secondly as I said you ca n't go wrong reading Jean Plaidy . I have nearly all her books in hardcover and am now collecting them on Kindle . ",4
"The beginning of the book was pretty good but once you reach the middle it is the same thoughts and feeling over and over again . ",2
"If you 've ever wondered what happened after Henry V this tale is an interesting take on history told from a woman 's point of view . The author does a wonderful job of recasting history from the vantage point of the supporting cast exploring motives and actions that changed history through another 's eyes . ",3
"Reading books on the theme of following the English dynasty from the Norman conquest to present this book covered the time after The Agincourt Bride birth and rise of Catherine of Valois and Joan of Ark by Mark Twain . It was very informative about the birth of Henry VI of England and how the Tudor dynasty began in England . Very well written easy to read and very interesting . It is a story of a Queen that does find love and happiness for a time . ",4
"Very interesting perspective . This book sheds light on how the Tudors made claim to the throne . I have always wondered . ",3
"Grandmother of the Tudor dynasty . Katherine of Valois grew up with a mentally unstable father and a lusty sinful mother who did nothing to help her husband or children though hard times . She was a terrible evil woman . Katherine never knowing a mothers love was seeking stability in any form . It is only logical to me that she married the conquer of her fathers own land desperate to escape the strife of France and her mothers ill fated choices . She was not a ambitious woman because she saw first hand what it means to be a king and how much of a burden it could easily become . Life had not kind to her father or her brothers they paid a high price for being the blood royal.When Katherine went to England she devoted herself fully to her husband the warrior king . Sadly within two years her blessed son was born whom she loved very deeply and her husband was dead and buried . Leaving her all alone in England . Katherine 's childhood affected her deeply . Much more than she ever let on to . She never expected anything in life especially not true love . I do not even think she knew what unconditional love was until she met Owen Tudor the welsh soldier who had served her late husband the king . She found comfort with Owen when her sweet son was taken from her as a little child to be raised by the high born English nobles who knew how to raise a child by a kings standards . Withering under the strain of loosing her son she begins to blossom with love for Owen . They say we never choose love it finds us and this is the case with Katherine.She did not choose to fall in love with him . Life has a way of finding it 's own path . When the path became visible she went for it . Knowing that she was putting herself in harms way of her brother in laws . She still sought her happiness and the consequences would put her into dire straights . I own this one bought at my local bookstore . ",4
"This book tells of the story of Catherine of Valois daughter of King Charles VI of France a gentle man though one who suffered from periodic bouts of insanity and Isabella of BavariaIngolstadt an evil scheming selfish and selfindulgent women who placed her children in the grim conditions of the Hotel De St Paul where Catherine describes her bleak childhood together with her siblings.She later describes the improvement in the life of the children after having been moved to the Abbey at Poissey where she met her older sister Isabelle who was the widow of England 's King Richard II.After her two older brothers die mysteriously poisoned on the orders of their mother ? and her third brother Charles is made crown prince and after France is conquered by English King Henry V Catherine become Henry 's bride in a politically advantageous marriage.She bears him the son who is to be Henry VIbut Henry is removed from her.She finds love again and secretly marries Welsh soldier Owen Tudor who was one of Henry V 's generals.After the death of the young king Henry 's uncle Duke of Bedford the scheming and ruthless Earl of Gloucester takes control over Henry VI.Owen Tudor is arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London and Catherine 's children by Owen are removed from her . She is incarcerated in Bermondsy Abbey where she dies of a broken heart.But her son Edmund will marry Margaret of Beaufort out of which will be born the founder of the Tudor dynasty and King Henry VII of England.This is finely written engaging and with romantic interest and a strong incentive to discover more about the historical figure written about.Jean Plaidy was a master of historical fiction . ",4
"For someone interested in historical fiction from tudor and earlier times Plaidy has a lot of offerings . I like historical fiction from the perspective of women and her books do just that . Reading this book started me on several others of her offerings . ",3
"Jean Plaidy is such a good historical fiction writer . I have read most of her works and I enjoy each one . They tend to blur together a little bit but still they are imaginative rich in history and character and you almost get a history lesson while reading a novel . I recommend all of her books . ",3
"This was an enjoyable read and it is packed full of all the goingson of the period . Not only does the reader learn of the life of Katherine of Valois but also figures such as Joan of Arc.However what is most fascinating is learning about how Katherine 's relationship with Owen Tudor occured . It really is a very interesting story.I love reading Plaidy 's books especially those in her Queens of England series as I love to learn about historical figures . Plaidy is a wonderful teacher . The only downside is that the books can read too much like a timeline and not a carefully narrated story . But then again when dealing with the story of a person 's life I do realize that it is much better to be accurate than fastastical.Recommended for those who like their historical fiction to be factually spoton . ",2
"This was the first Plaidy book I 'd read in years ever since high school actually . I remembered loving her stuff back then but as I read this one & The Sun in Splendour I had the sense that the books were copiously cribbed histories with a minimal effort at dramatizing the whole thing . No doubt a reason why she was so prolific . The dialogue shows no real spark and is absurdly simplistic and the pace is about as brief and deep as an encyclopedia article ! From scene to scene the same phrases and thoughts were repeated as though we could have forgotten ! Katherine of Valois is just a woman talking not a friend or a confidante or even a real person and this reader eventually did n't care . The reader is told who are the characters are not shown.So it was disappointing to realize that Plaidy 's style is n't all that good after years of nostalgia but that 's the way of so many childhood authors I guess ! I suppose that Plaidy is a good author to start with for a time periodroyal personage and then read a novel that is more focused and has more depth & narrative skill . IE read Plaidy 's Sun in Splendour and then Sharon Kay Penman 's novel on Richard III . Do NOT read them in the reverse order as I did else you 'll also be stabbing your eyes at Plaidy 's dry uninspired prose with the memories of Penman making it all the more excruciating . Better yet save lots of time and read a Wikipedia entry and then grab Penman . ",1
"I have read a lot of Jean Plaidy 's books and this one is definitely the least of my favorites . The story itself has too much repetition and the ending is too abrupt . Plus I was hoping for an epilogue that explained properly the demise of Queen Katherine and the fate of her children and husband . I had to look up in another source to find all those facts . I will continue to read more of Plaidy 's novels but I 'm hoping the rest are better than this one . ",1
"This is the seventh book in the Queens of England series by the author a masterful storyteller who is also known as Victoria Holt to her fans . It is a well written novel of historical fiction that tells the little known story of Katherine of Valois.She was a French Princess daughter of King Charles VI the gentle but mad King of France and Queen Isabeau an evil selfabsorbed libertine who cared little for her children . After the famous battle of Agincourt in which King Henry V of England vanquished France Katherine found herself married to this warrior king and living in England . She was to become the mother of King Henry VI of England.Shortly after their son 's birth King Henry V died a premature death . Young Queen Katherine saw their son Henry taken from her to be raised by others . Retiring to the countryside she fell in love with a Welsh squire Owen Tudor who had faithfully served King Henry V and now served Katherine as part of her household . Theirs was to be an illicit love carried out in secret as the alternative was to be the recipient of charges of treason.Try as they might no amount of secrecy could prevent the vicissitudes of life from raining down upon their happiness . Political intrigue would serve to bring their illicit love to light . It would act as the catalyst for a turning point in history . What happened to Katherine and Owen would give rise in the future to the house of Tudor one of the greatest dynasties ever to rule England.The book grounds their love story in the context of the period which saw England as the conqueror of France . It covers that turbulent time in history that saw Joan of Arc rise from the remote French countryside to ensure the crowning of the Dauphin of France as its rightful King . It is a spellbinding account of the struggles between England and France and those who would rule these two countries . It is a book that will be enjoyed by all those with a fondness for well written historical fiction . ",4
"Jean Plaidy is well known for her lengthy and ambitious histfic series about the queens of England by dynasty . The Queen 's Secret depicts the life of Katherine of Valois daughter to the mentally unstable Charles VI of France and queen of both England and France after her marriage to British King Henry V. Katherine has had a sheltered somewhat impoverished upbringing as a younger child receiving little attention from her scheming powerful and dissolute mother . Love of any sort has been notably absent from her young life . She thinks she has found it in Henry and is sorely grieved when he dies a short time after the death of their first child . She is also subject to the whims and directives of her brothersinlaw particularly those of the jealous Gloucester.Katherine now Queen Mother experiences a wondrous joyful surprise when she and Welsh soldier Owen Tudor fall in love the real thing this time . And that is the Queen 's secret for Gloucester has pushed a bill through parliament forbidding the remarriage of the queen.Within this plot Jean Plaidy follows Katherine from the queen 's own perspective from childhood to almost middle age . This is a relatively quiet novel with momentous events such as the mission and death of Joan of Arc described from afar . Katherine directly participates in few of the whirlwind of changes that swirl around her and determine the course of her life so it is also a talky book sometimes too repetitive as Katherine mulls over her situation . But along the way Plaidy makes some pertinent observations about the nature of power and its influence on those who do and do not wield it most tellingly in her portrayal of Henry 's brothers and Katherine 's mother . She also clarifies the numerous personal and political complications that ultimately prepare the ground for the rise of the Tudor dynasty . What The Queen 's Secret lacks in excitement it makes up for in its well researched detail . ",2
"Katherine is the daughter of the king of France known as Charles the Mad . In his lucid moments the royal children are well cared for but during his long bouts of madness the often live in hunger darkness and uncertainty . At nineteen however Katherine leaves this life to become the wife of the king of England . For a while she has found happiness however just after the birth of her first child her husband dies leaving England in a period of turmoil part way through the Hundred Years ' War . To keep her from becoming too powerful as the mother of a child king it is determined that Katherine will have to live alone far from the seat of power . She is even forbidden from marrying again . Katherine however falls in love with one of her guardians Owen Tudor . Their relationship will be the foundation of the Tudor dynasty two generations later.Quote Then he turned to us and said ' I Henry born at Monmouth shall small time reign and much get but Henry of Windsor shall long reign and lose all . ' It was strange my lady and as though someone spoke through him.Katherine is lucky enough to be in two happy marriages unfortunately one is very brief and the other necessarily secret and dangerous . This is particularly sad because Katherine has no great ambition beyond being allowed to live in peace with a husband and children . It is very interesting work about a queen of England I previously did not know much about . Her marriage is the foundation for conflict and problems in England in later years and the reader is invested in the characters enough to want to do some research after the novel ends to find out what becomes of the principal players . That 's always a good sign in a work of historical fiction . ",3
"For many fans of historical fiction Jean Plaidy 's books are a treasure . For me they are like a favorite blanket perhaps a little dated and not on the cutting edge of a fad but something familiar and comfortable.The Queen 's Secret originally published in 1990 by G.P . Putnam 's Sons and then reissued by Three Rivers Press in 2007 was one of Plaidy 's later works and tells the story of Katherine of Valois wife of Henry V mother to Henry VII and by virtue of her second marriage to Owen Tudor the founder of the Tudor kings of England.The story is told in Katherine 's voice and begins with her childhood in France as the daughter of King Charles VI known to history as King Charles the Mad . Unable to maintain his lucidity or authority France deteriorated into civil war in the early 15th century and the English led by King Henry V were able to divide invade and conquer.In the aftermath of the infamous Battle of Agincourt remember ? Shakespeare anyone ? a tenative peace treaty was negotiated which acknowledged Henry to be the successor to the French crown once mad King Charles kicked the proverbial bucket and also threw in poor Katherine to sweeten the pot for Henry . They were married soon after and she bore him one child who would later become King Henry VI although her new husband croaked soon after.Being a widow turned out to be a good thing for Katherine . She fell in love with a Welsh commoner named Owen Tudor . They married in secret and went on to have four children through which the Tudor line of kings would emerge . For those unfamiliar with this part of English history I wo n't give away the ending but it is a compelling tale.Plaidy is as usual very true to her characters and historical facts . The voice of Katherine is almost childlike which helps Plaidy disseminate the convoluted politics of the day in a manner readers can easily keep up with but also likely reflects Katherine 's actual knowledge of events . Despite being Queen of England there seems to be little historical evidence that Katherine had anything to do with political intrigue . The dialog is beautifully simple as well . Think Anna Sewell and Black Beauty.The only complaint I had was a slight mixup in the author 's own timeline in the story Katherine and Owen we are told become lovers on the night that Katherine 's young son Henry VI is taken from her at the age of two to be raised in another household . Later we skip ahead in time and young Henry is now five years old when Katherine discovers she is pregnant by Owen . Plaidy writesWhy I should have been so surprised I can not imagine . Owen and I had been passionate lovers for some months.Katherine in The Queen 's SecretWell I suppose three years can be considered some months but the inconsistency leaped out at me . This coupled with the constant foreshadowing of doom and gloom were my only bugaboos about the story.But these small flaws should be overlooked in the face of such a wonderful tale . This is a time period not often covered by historical fiction authors . Katherine and her contemporaries such as Joan of Arc were to change the fate both England and France . I highly recommend this read to any historical fiction fan as it makes accessible a time period too often overlooked.I mentioned at the beginning of this review that Three Rivers Press reissued this novel in 2007 . They have done so with a handful of Jean Plaidy books . If you enjoy her work and would like to see more since many of her older books are quite difficult to find these days please contact Three Rivers Press a division of Random House and express your interest in order to keep them coming !

"Jean Plaidy was a very good author although she did tend to make up her facts as she went along which makes it very hard to read if you are at all familiar with the what 's who 's and such . This book is exceptionally tedious . I found it very disappointing . ",1
"I had read many of Jean Plaidy 's books years ago and had really enjoyed them since they fed my love of Medieval Romance Novels . But with Ms. Plaidy 's books you actual get a History lesson that is very enjoyable and she brings Historical characters to life . I had lost all of my Jean Plaidy books in a house fire 6 years ago and had never gotten around to replacing them and I had all but forgotten them . Then I found out through our Family Genealogist that we were decendents of Owen Tudor . I decided to do a Google Book Search and this particular book popped up in the Search Results . Sure enough the book chronicals Katherines marriage to both Henry V and Owen Tudor . To be honest I was really excited after pouring over all the clinical reseach about them and was looking forward to reading something with a bit more romance in it . I had completely forgotten about this Plaidy book so it has been like reading it fresh for the first time again but this time reading it with a new understanding . A sincere Thanks to Ms. Plaidy for bringing Katherine & Owen 's love story to print and making Katherine & Owen 's life & romance come alive . ",4
"I found this to be a wellwritten story of a littleknown part of English history . Katherine becomes a likable believable character and her secret is incredible but true . An obscure grandson plays another important part in the complicated English history of these times . ",4
"I consider myself an amateur historian at this point . I have read everything by Anya Seyton the master and Philipa GregoryOther Boleyn Girl and Queen 's Fool great others are fading into 3 stars watched every Hollywood and BBC rendition of anything referencing historical England and spend every spare dime on historical trips to England to see every castle and every pile of rocks that is ancient.I heard about Jean Plaidy 's Plantagenet Series out of print from the 70 's and Ebay 'd the entire collection over a dozen novels out of excitement . I read the first one and can not bring myself to read the second even though all sit on my shelf collecting dust.Then a friend bought 'the new book on Katherine Valois ' . I pick it up and start reading not realizing it is Jean Plaidy . I 'm on page 20 and can not get past this 3rd grade writing lack of historical references . It reads like a children 's book ! There is no fact no rich historical detail making it feel like a supermarket novel and short choppy sentences make it annoying to read ! It 's been by my bedside for 3 months and can not pick it up.Dissappointingly I say that this is a waste of time because no one appreciates and loves an Englandhistorical novel more than me.I honestly think this author is on autopilot pushing out books one after the other and sacrificing good enticing reading in exchange for big bucks . I honestly feel this author is insulting our intelligence.Highly NOT recommended . ",0
"The Queen 's Secret is about Katherine of Valois who married Henry V and was the mother of Henry VI . When Henry V dies Katherine is at first devastated . Her one year old son is now King of England and she fears that he will be taken away and raised by others . Her fears are wellfounded and in despair she turns to Owen Tudor her Clerk of the Wardrobe for comfort . Eventually they fall in love but a queen is n't allowed to love where she will . They marry in secret and the rest of the book is about them trying to keep their relationship a secret.This book is so repetitive and badly written . Katherine will narrate that something has happened . Then she will go and tell Owen that it happened . Then twenty pages later they will repeat their conversation . Seriously . I was on page 264 and Owen and Katherine had a conversation that rehashed everything that had previously happened in the book . And if Katherine is worried about something you get to read about it again and again and again and again . She worries about her son getting taken away . So she talks to her nurse then Owen then a random person . There is n't any new information in these conversations either . You just get beaten over the head with her feelings . I thought she would be an interesting character . Instead Plaidy makes her seem like a whiny helpless creature who magically forgets the world when pregnant this is n't an unfounded accusation she is pregnant five times in the book and mentions at least twice that while pregnant the world 's events do n't seem very important to her . This really may be attributing too much characterization to her because I cared about none of the people in this book . The dialogue is like a bad romance novel . I think the average sentence is about five words long . Is is all so awkward and stilted . This is a fascinating time in history . Henry V actually conquers France then suddenly dies before he fully consolidates power . He leaves his two brothers in charge while his infant son grows up . Joan of Arc then rises up to save France from the English . And yet reading this book I was either bored to tears or frustrated enough to throw it against a wall.One final complaint . Ellipses are not substitutes for commas ! Jean Plaidy apparently never learned that . In a random sampling of four pages I counted 14 ellipses . It isridiculousand distractingand completely inappropriate punctuation.Really I recommend reading anything other than this book . Save your money and your time and get something different . Edith Pargeter wrote a novel called A Bloody Field by Shrewsbury that is about Henry IV and Henry V when he is young . It is an excellent book . Read that instead . ",0
"The Queen 's Secret is about Katherine of Valois queen to Henry V and secret wife of Owen Tudor.Katherine tells her story in the first person beginning with her miserable insecure childhood in France with her mentally ill father and her corrupt mother and ending with her forcible separation from the love of her life Owen Tudor.Plaidy 's depiction of Katherine 's childhood and its effects on her as a woman gives her a certain psychological depth and though Katherine is ultimately helpless to prevent her fate she preserves a certain dignity and strength about her that keeps her in the reader 's sympathies . Plaidy also is good at conveying the mixed feelings that Katherine has as a French princess married to an English king a situation that makes her position in both countries difficult.I did find the structure hereit 's one of those novels where the narrator looks back upon her life as she prepares for deatha bit limiting . Although we know from history what was to become of Owen Tudor and Katherine 's children after her death the novel leaves their stories unresolved so there 's still a sense of being left hanging when the novel ends.From what I 've read after reading this novel little is known about how the relationship of Owen Tudor and Katherine came about . I thought that Plaidy 's version of it was plausible and that Katherine 's willingness to risk all for love showed an appealing and believable reckless streak in her character.All in all a worthy addition to your Plaidy shelf either in this spanking new version or in one of the older ones .

"If you are interested in the kings and queens of England over the years this is a delightful and very informative book . The characters remain true throughout and the book although fiction has been well researched . You will enjoy it ",3
"This is a story of Katherine of Valois the daughter of Charles VI whose grandson was the first King of Tudor dynasty.Katherine certainly had her share of unhappiness . Living in squalor with her brothers and sisters while her mother ignored her children and spend her time with her lovers instead . Her father appeared to have been a kind man but given to fits of madness which essentially took him out of picture as well . Despite all Katherine grows up to be an educated and attractive woman . It was arranged that she marries King Henry V of England and surprisingly theirs was a love matchor as much love as Henry could give . Henry died suddenly and once again Katherine is alone with only her son to keep her company . After a few years her advisers take over her son Henry upbringing and Katherine is only allowed to see him for short visits.Lonely and desolate Katherine forms a friendship with Owen Tudor one of the Welsh knights . Eventually they fall in love and marry in secret.Overall this is good historical book . There is couple of things that i want to comment on howeverJean Plaidy 's style of writing is really kind of like nonfiction historical book . Its a pretty easy read and i went through the whole book in couple of days . However characters are really one dimentional there is hardly any depth to them at all . Also any details of everyday life food dress customs are missing altogether which in my mind makes it more of a nonfiction historical narrative rather than a novel . Do n't get me wrongI liked the book but if you want richness of historical details you wo n't find it here . ",2
"The Live Program Wake Up to Life is Powerful and Profound the only complete Conference de Mello allowed to be recorded . This book is the writtentranscript for the Live Conference Wake Up to Life . It is the only fulllength de Mello Conference available and the only one he allowed to be recorded . It is even more powerful because you hear de Mello Live with an audience.De Mello also has three films one is A Way to God for Today . These are excellent.Many have wondered how a man from India could speak so pointedly to one 's personal experience and background.One reviewer has described this quality In his words and in his person there naturally flow the best currents of East and West in a holistic approach which incorporates theology psychology literature and popular culture . He is an international man whose planetary perspective provides the ingredients for a newly emerging human spirituality.Another said In one day he unburdened me of years of guilt and wrong thinking . I am now living with fresh eyes and a new heart.He provided an atmosphere for me to experience God . . . He has broken . . . a mystical sound barrier in our spiritual growth that has elevated our capacities to be more loving and introspective . ",4
"Written as if he were talking to you this book is full of gems of insight . If you are on a spiritual path this book is an essential . Anthony DeMello makes the case for awareness as the basis for spiritual awakening . This book should appeal to both Buddhists and Christians . ",4
"This is an excellent book . De Mello went far beyond the orthodox catholic dogma by addressing what to me is one of the most important practical and existential issues facing us how does one learn to live one 's life with the bittersweet delightfulness that accompanies us when we manage to be present and aware . In other words how do we learn to become a free person . Typically our awareness is clouded by others ' expectations and by our desires to escape the perceived unpleasantness of the present moment . In order to free ourselves from the desires and escapism we need to be aware de Mello 's book is a classic and still unsurpassed manual that guides us into the conscious universe where we can finally heave a sigh of relief and start enjoying this great gift of life .

"This was the first book from the self helpnew age genre that I read and I have since gone back and reread it several times . Some of the information in this book was difficult for me to accept nonetheless the wisdom contained on these pages will truly open your mind . At first your beliefs may take quite a beating as DeMello really challenges the readers belief systems and ideas of reality but he does mellow out after the first few chapters pun intended . This is a book you will want to own and you will most likely continue to learn from it every time you read it . Just to give you an idea of how much I liked this book after reading it I immediately went out and bought a half dozen copies to give away . ",4
"This is not an easy book to read.Which is exactly why I love it so much.It tantalises the reader to question what is being said and very few books in the same genre out there manage to do that . The first time I read this book I could n't put it down.I found it exciting and alot of what De Mello said refreshing . I decided to reread the book again after having it for a year or two and I found it just as exciting but by the time I had finished the book was thoroughly tired of the De Mello condescending and patronising tone which at times was unnecessarily over the top.Nevertheless it does n't spoil the content of the book which is brilliant.If you crave a book that will put you on the path to questioning your own reality and sense of being then this book is a great starting point .

"Awareness by Anthony De Mello is useful parts do not conform with Church teachings . Good to read but read carefully ! ",2
"My only disappointment and it was n't the fault of the book or the author was that it was not about the U.S. although there certainly are connections . If you have doubts about satanic ritualcult abuse this book is a baseline for any kind of awareness . And there ARE connections between satanic ritual abuse and government mind control experimentation sad as that may be . I read this book a while ago but was not going to review it because it is out of print and I got it somewhere elseuntil I saw it reviewed here by somebody else . Let me add my voice to those who are also in the trenches digging this stuff up . Do n't allow the voices to be silenced ! Do n't allow the secrets to be buried ! As long as we do that our children future children will remain at risk . ",3
"This book is only informative about the subject of satanic ritual abuse if you are totally unaware of better books about the subject such as Satanic Panic by Jeffrey Victor . As it is even considering it 's focusing mainly in the UK and that the publishing date is just before this whole hysteria was exposed fully Boyd makes a few good points but obscures it with piling on claims of people who assert this stuff exists on an underground global scale . I found it painful intellectually to read as Boyd refers to highly biased sources some since been discredited and when he does mention sources such as FBI profiler Ken Lanning he neglects to mention anything by these sources that would discount the claims made by SRA proponents.One of the many claims is that people of high influence such as police doctors lawyers and so forth are behind the satanic abuse and that even with the claims of breeders and human sacrifice these satanists are so clever that they hide all the evidence every time . I find that highly unlikely . Supposed there is generational satanism yet none of this was made public until after Michele Remembers and Satan 's Underground . Amd of course the legal proof he uses includes the Richard Ramirez and the other alleged satanic murders usually carried out by indivduals . If this exists in the scale they claim where are the child porn where are the altars and the books where are the pelvic exams of the alleged brood mares to prove they gave birth ? None are provided . It 's all stories and claims nothing to confirm the details . No physical evidence at all in fact.Now that we know how this hysteria came about and was perpetuated how urban legends were thought of as fact how children have been coerced to believe something is true when in fact it was n't and how Lauren Stratford lied and in all these alleged accounts NONE of them have shown physical evidence of Satanic cults a book like this is more akin to fueling the hysteria and sell books rather than actually examining the subject openly.Boyd makes a few errors in his references maybe not realizing that some of what he used were from sources of dubious credibility . File 18 and Jeremiah Films are two examples of bad sources who are highly biased.If you want to find ONE book that deals with this subject extensively Satanic Panic does a good job of it . For thsoe who have a copy of this book may I suggest you note the various names cited as experts and cross check them online or better yet get a copy of the book Witch Hunts by Kerr Cuhulain.Yes pedophiles use cult ritual to scare their victims . And yes there are cases of people whio claim to be satanists usually from rock music or something committing murder . We have proof of child porn of pedophiles abd so forth . But we have no proof oif this underground organized satanic ritual abuse claim . And yet we are to believe the victims at their word . Not unlike the afflicted girls ' at the Salem Witch trials witch their spectral evidence . This is the same criteria of proof that we see about the worldwide cabal of Zionists and the New World Order and so forth.I am open for objective empirical proof . If you claim your car was changed from a Buick to an elephant I need to see you owned a Buick and how the elephant appeared in your possession . I also need to examine your account . I need proof other than your story and claims of people with THEIR stories.For the record I am not a Satanist . I am a Wiccan and I highly do NOT like pedophiles nor blood sacrifice . Also may I point out that there have been a number of crimes committed by supposedly devout Christians even ministers and credible people do NOT associate the crime with the religion . By the proof in this book for example with all the acocunts of Catholic priests being pedophiles the assumption using the same arguments used in this book is that the Catholic Church is behind child porn and whatever else claims one wishes to make.I would not consider this an autoritative source . There are too many things wrong with it and of Boyd 's dancing around the obvious problems for me to recomend this to anyone other than a knowledgable expert and that only to point out how bad research and relying upon the wrong sources can lead to more harm than good .

"Best book on satanic ritual abuse and Masonic cults I have no idea why it 's unavailable It was published by Fount the UK subsidiary of HarperCollins I found it in a discount bin for one dollar I read the book twice and it 's very creepy I go to a lot of used book stores and when I was in Boise Idaho I traded it in for beer money and it was still on the shelf a year later so I bought it back I guess it 's just too unbelievably dark for some people to handle The author does not proselytize Well documented and it lists sources Most satanic books try to shove the Christian agenda down your throat This book just states the facts and it becomes completely believable Do not read this book alone at night There 's some great eye witness accounts of human sacrifice mind control death threats blackmail drugs used to produce submission and buy loyalty from the addicted victims This is an excerpt from the back cover Opinion is divided on the truth of the matter and the divisions are acrimonious . Skeptics argue vehemently that ritual abuse is an imported myth believed by the gullible and propagated by the hysterical For his investigation Andrew Boyd has stepped beyond the current cases to interview professional psychiatrists across Britain . Between them they claim to be counseling some 900 victims of ritual abuse . Their detailed accounts coupled with indepth statements by alleged survivors are shocking in the extreme . Just as shocking is the remarkable coherence between them . Is it fact or fantasy that lies behind these blasphemous rumors ? Excellent book if you can find it I bought it about five years ago and I 've never seen another copy Maybe the publishers got a late night phone call from one of Satan 's minions ",4
"Having worked with children involved in ritual abuse cases I found this book of particular interest . In 199495 I worked directly with several children who had been ritually abused . At the time I was more concerned with giving them sound daytoday care than examining the particulars of their abuse histories . I was very shocked when years later ritual abuse came up in conversation and there seemed to be doubt as to whether or not such abuse even existed . Having worked with the direct result of that abuse I found this skepticism on par with disbelief in a round earth.I searched amazon for relative literature and found Blasphemous Rumors . It is not good reading it is horrifying reading . I would recommend this book to anyone who doubts the veracity of ritual abuse or DID dissociative identity disorder claims . Rumors outlines several cases and survivor stories from the UK . Some of the material is incredible and very difficult to comprehend as it is so far outside of what most of the public believes . The material here is evidence of some of the worst human depravity immaginable.Read this book and ask yourself why there appears to be such a coordinated effort to discredit ritual abuse survivors.This is a must read for any one in the social work field or anyone interested in DID or other trauma induced disorders . ",4
"If you are unsure if ritual abuse is fact or fantasy this is the book to read . Andrew Boyd is very objective in covering his research findings . Most of the alleged abuse in this book took place in the U.K..However there is information on alleged abuse that took place in other countries such as the U.S. At the time that I write this review Blasphemous Rumors is out of print . Nevertheless I suggest getting your hands on this book if you have any questions on this topic . ",4
"Reaching Out was written by a mystic Catholic priest who was born in Holland but spent most of his life in the United States . The author Henri Nouwen gained an impressive following during his teaching years at Notre Dame Yale and Harvard Universities and wrote 40 books on spirituality . In 1975 while teaching at Yale Nouwen wrote Reaching Out which included a special edition inclusion of Beyond the Mirror an account of Nouwen 's perceived neardeath experience and the spiritual enlightenment which resulted in some of the views expressed in Reaching Out.According to Nouwen 1975 the path of spirituality is a journey between polarities in three separate areas . The first area includes the distance between solitude and loneliness this encompasses reaching toward self . The second area involved reaching toward others and is described as the polarity between hospitality and hostility . Finally Nouwen discusses the third area prayer verses illusion the reaching toward God . The author explains that each individual finds himself somewhere between the extreme poles at different times of his life but that our goal as Christians is to remain on the side of solitude hospitality and prayer.Nouwen 1975 posited that loneliness is the sad condition of the fallen human heart which causes us to react to others in selfish ways . He explains that we feel lonely no matter how many people we have around us because it is a condition of the heart and attitude rather than a lack of fellowship . Solitude on the other hand is described by Nouwen as a place where we are comfortable with our selves and are therefore able to be comfortable with others . In a place of solitude we are no longer desperately reaching out for others to meet our needs rather our focus is turned inward and looks to God as our source.The goal of living a victorious Christian life requires that we have a hospitable attitude toward mankind and nature rather than approaching it with hostility Nouwen 1975 . When we begin seeing our friends employers children and acquaintances as travelers who are passing through this life with us we are more able to treat them with hospitality . This attitude selfcorrects the hostile attitudes of ownership and debt toward one another . For example rather than seeing children as your possessions which will in turn cause pride when they do well and shame when they do poorly we should see them as fellow travelers whom we have been given the task of caring for and raising . Nouwen explains that this helps us correctly discipline them when they are young as well as let them go when they are adults.Lastly Nouwen 1975 speaks about the importance of the last polarity illusion verses prayer . Not only was this the most important area to discuss according to Nouwen it was the area he was the most familiar with since he worked with the Trappist Monks in the Abby of Genesse in New York Nouwen had a great deal of experience seeking expertise in the art of prayer and stated that it was the most basic task of our lives and yet the most illusive one . He wrote it is very hard to come in touch with it to get a grasp on it to get hold of it or even to put a finger on it . p. 84 ",3
"Nouween explains there are three transition states of spirituality comprised of the following1 . From loneliness to solitude2 . From hostility to hospitality and3 . From illusion to prayer.The book itself is refreshing in the sense human loneliness is taken to its bottom components leading to the acceptance of solitude . By seeking out others for console people do not directly deal with hurt themselves or seek prayer in God.Often we go to good men and women with our problems in the secret hope that they will take our burden away from us and free us from our loneliness Nouwen 35.Overall according to Nouwen we seek attention and connection unfulfilled in social situations influenced by culture however Nouwen expresses loneliness as a normal encounter . By dwelling in solitude we are able to understand our loneliness as a component of understanding our innerself . Secondly Nouwen expresses how hostility interferes with our ability to truly be hospitable When we have become sensitive to the painful contours of our hostility we can start identifying the lines of its opposite toward which we are called to move hospitality Nouwen 71.Interestingly Nouwen expresses true hospitality as the ability to give people options rather than limitations . Instead of cornering a stranger giving the ability of freedom and befriending a person with no ulterior motives is truly warranted of the title of hospitality in its various forms.Accordingly by not keeping in touch with prayer we loose what we have worked hard to grow Nouwen 116 by creating an illusion of our own mortality and meaning . Nouwen says sentiment can manifest false expectations however I must question whether it is really a technique of human comfort . As there are many ways to be hospitable there are as many ways to pray . Sometimes it is necessary to realize the variations of how to pray in order to pray with heart.Although Nouwen explains how spirituality changes through steps it is necessary to recognize the importance of desperation . About a year and a half ago I suffered an unusual injury to my knee I injured the saphenous nerve and had a 30 percent muscle loss within 6 weeks not only that I also suffered from problematic gait and knee tracking problems . It was n't until I reached out to God after five chemical nerve blocks that I decided to go for one alternative medical procedure a heat treated nerve block where burning the myelin sheath prevents pain signals from traveling to the brain . I questioned what God wanted from me and what he wanted me to learn from this experience and whether I should put myself under another painful procedure . I was at the end of understanding as it had affected every aspect of my life including the ability to even grocery shop on my own . Up until then I had never experienced a situation where I felt I had no control . At the bottom of feeling desperate my only choice was to reach out to God for help as difficult as that was he answered my prayers as simple as that . I virtually had no pain with the last procedure as I am now working on building muscle . At that moment I did feel lonely hostility and had the illusion modern medical science was all I needed . Being the expression of our greatest love it does not keep pain away from us Nouwen107.Until then I believed I was spiritual however the experience alone not only strengthened my spirituality but also understanding of God and of people in debilitating situations.As Nouwen believes solitude is necessary Is there such a thing as too much solitary ? At what point do people cross into the understanding solitude can produce positive results ? With that in mind is solitude too much to handle for some people ? Nouwen makes a good point that interaction with God and the Holy Spirit opens paths of understanding the self . I found the book enlightening in opening my eyes to themes around me and those used to control.As Nouwen questions the legitimacy of prayer in forms of illusion I do not think prayer is ever meant to portray illusions of grandour immortality or selfishness but rather many pray for positive meaning in themselves and others . I can understand if Nouwen 's point referred to nonChristians and Christians alike letting prayer fall to the wayside of illusions however prayer itself is generally heartfelt.This book aligned at the right time coming out of a personal crisis which allowed me to question my own meaning of spirituality and sanctity . It is interesting this book happened to be required when it did . It is inspiring to step back and look closer at the necessary steps to produce meaningful prayer and understanding . Going forward I will continue to question myself and my ability to counsel effectively and will continue to give up my control to God.By Lisa Marie StatlerFinal Note Telephone Counseling and Online Counseling can be very good ways of helping someone get through a hard time .

"A book I came across while in school because it was a suggested read . Fell in love with the book and fell in love with Nouwen still one of my favorite Nouwen reads . If you have n't read any of his work he 's similar to Merton in the search for the true self langauge . ",4
"In light of almost unanimous praise for this book among other reviewers I hate to be that guy . I 'm taking a seminary course on Nouwen so this was the first of five of his books that we were assigned . And I really wanted to like it . But I 'm not sure that I 've ever fallen asleep so frequently while reading a book as I did with this one . I just did n't connect with it at all.His main thesis is that the Christian life consists of movement along three trajectories from loneliness to solitude from hostility to hospitality and from illusion to prayer connected to our relationships with ourselves other people and God respectively . My problem with the book is that my experience do n't even remotely align with what Nouwen describes and seemingly assumes as normative . Quite frankly I have felt a lot of deficiency in my life but I do n't think that I have ever felt lonely and I do n't just think that 's merely an indication of a lack of serious personal reflection and honest selfappraisal . But without that shared experience the first movement is meaningless to me.The second movement from hostility to hospitality was the one that resonated most with me as I understand my natural inclination towards hostility though more covert than overt and see God 's different intention for my interaction with others . But the final movement was where he totally lost me . The sort of spiritual reality that he describes as prayer is so far removed from my own experience and so unappealing to me that it did n't connect with me at all.It 's worth noting that I found one particular point to be extremely powerful . In the middle of Chapter 8 I love Nouwen 's words about the need to learn from church history and from the saints throughout the ages . The really great saints of history do n't ask for imitation . Their way was unique and can not be repeated . But they invite us into their lives and offer a hospitable space for our own search This is great stuff.Yet overall I can say that reading this book was a strangely unnerving experience for me . Having heard rave reviews about Nouwen and his work from seemingly countless people whom I respect I want to love his books . It 's not that I found Reaching Out to be utterly disagreeable but rather that it is just totally unintelligible to me . I just do n't know what he 's talking about from an experiential standpoint . It 's as if his experiences are completely foreign and his perspectives are totally unknown to me . On one level I 'm disappointed in my inability to gain more from the book and on another level I 'm wondering if I need to just acknowledge that Nouwen simply is n't a writer who connects with me and that might not be a reflection on him or on me but simply an observation of reality.In light of the other positive reviews I wo n't be so arrogant as to suggest that Reaching Out is somehow a lousy book . I will instead suggest that it 's not for everyone and it certainly was n't very helpful for me . ",1
"Next to the Bible this book has changed my life more than any other book . I use it constantly in my counseling career and have probably ready it 14 times myself . When you get it do n't just read it and put it down . Read it again and again . It is amazing . ",4
"Being a Christian in today 's society is often a scary thing . People love to badmouth our faith in something invisible . This book gives us the tools to strengthen our own selves before we get brave enough to talk to others to offer them hospitality and then to help them know God themselves . It 's a 'read more than once ' book . ",4
"Henri Nouwen again in REACHING OUT inspires and provides a mental vacation from the cares of life . A great read over and over again . ",4
"Someone once quipped that Henri Nouwen was such a gifted writer that anything he scribbled out even on a discarded bus ticket deserved to get published ! Having read many of his published works I would nod heartily at that hyperbolic statement ! There is in Nouwen 's simple and beautiful literary expressions a profound grasp of life in the Spirit with all its odd tensions and paradoxes . This shows in the schema he uses in this book which sees the progress in the spiritual life not so much as a ladder one climbs unabated to the end goal visio dei ! that traditional authors deigned to employ . It is more like the polarity that one shuttles back and forth between the Spirit and the flesh in the language of St Paul . But here he creatively uses the idea of Reaching Out ' to self to others and to God . In these three movements of outreach one finds himself experiencing the deepening of the life of faith when he moves from the false self of loneliness to the true self of solitude from hostility towards others to hospitality and finally from the illusions of hubris to prayer.These concepts are not new but Nouwen has a refreshing way of weaving together the ancient Scriptures and the timetested wisdom of the spiritual fathers and mothers with the modern struggles of contemporary men as well as his own existential issues . He writes in such a way that those with eyes to see could recognize the images and stirrings of their own hearts in them and perhaps discover for themselves the way out of the maze one often finds himself . I particularly love the way he retells the ancient stories of the Zen masters as well as those of the Eastern Orthodox teachers . No one tells them like he does within the larger reflections of what it means to live the spiritual life ie . 'to live a life in the Spirit of Jesus Christ ' . In this he shows his ecumenical spirit and his clear discernment of truths within the diversity of faith traditions while remaining deeply anchored in the gospel.One small complaint that some readers make of Nouwen is that his prolific writings often lack the systematic character that would have helped believers construct a more comprehensive and well thought out understanding of what it means to follow Jesus . I think this critique has some merits because many of his writings are done in the forms of letters You are my Beloved spiritual journals Genesee Diary case studies Wounded Healer and biographical reflections Adam which carry a plethora of gems here and there which some feel need to be pieced together into a beautiful chalice ! Then again perhaps these genres are a more accurate reflection of life itself with all its messy bits and mysteries that do not yield to neat systematization . Having said that if anyone must have a book that sets out the thoughts of Nouwen in his systematic best this might well be the book he is looking for as Nouwen answers in three movements the book 's central thesis 'What does it mean to live in the Spirit of Jesus Christ ? ' . Savour this book slowly and meditatively and be nourished by this deep well of inspiring truths that move the heart as well as the mind . ",4
"I have read some of Nouwen 's work before and this is one of his best . My daughter spoke of this book as she was reading it for a study she was doing at the Christian school where she works and I bought a copy as she was using hers . In the middle section while speaking to everyone he addresses parents teachers and professionals . I 'd say more but you really need to read it yourself . This is a book that read carefully has the potential to change how you function as a result of your faith . ",4
"For anyone who is looking for the existential version or spiritual side of their Christianity this book has much to say . Nouwen 's theme of hospitality needs to be reviewed by most older Christians to see what they may be overlooking . The first chapter is slow reading but important to the theme . Enjoy ! ",4
"This book stimulated discussion and growth in our weekly spirit group . The three movements are from loneliness to solitude from hostility to hospitality and from illusion to prayer . Key is this quote We do not have to deny or avoid our loneliness our hostilities and our illusions . To the contrary When we have the courage to let these realities come to our full attention understand them and confess them then they can slowly be converted into solitude hospitality and prayer . Discussing this book helped our group develop the author 's habit of owning up to our weaknesses and helped us to realize more deeply that spiritual maturity is not a life without weaknesses but an ability to acknowledge them and be open to their healing . ",3
"This is my second taste of Nouwen and it has been even better than the first The Inner Voice of Love . This book is a valuable component of the amazing turnaround of my depression.Some Christians say that when you find yourself burnt out and needy you should go back to the basics . They offer no new solutions and point you back to daily quiet times and church attendance and service . But here is a book that offers a completely new and refreshing look at God and life . It offers a chance to slow down to deal with your own heart and soul before rushing to perform as a Christian should . Nouwen shows that only when we take time to love and hear ourselves to become comfortable with who we are and be content with solitute only after those steps are taken can we reach out to others in true love . We simply must love ourselves and deal with our hurts and needs before we can help and learn from others.We often reach out to others when we are hurting . We are afraid to deal alone with our needs . We are desperately seeking someone or something to drown out our own voice to give us new answers . We watch television listen to music read books socialize . This book points us back into ourselves . For we are indeed God 's children and the Spirit is in us . When we learn to be still we can offer that very stillness and peace to others . We can commune with God in prayer . We can break the illusions of business of our circumstance ruling us . And we can once again be in touch with ourselves others and our God.This is a lifechanging painshattering book . In these pages we meet the Healer the God who loves us infinitely and takes the time to fill us up and heal our wounds . We meet the God who gives us the peace to live a centered life not a chaotic one . ",4

"For many years I wondered why some people abruptly shifted their eyes away from my eyes . I also wondered how it would be possible for me to acquire the charisma that I admire in many public people.This book is the answer.People who shift their eyes from my eyes fear that if I notice who they are and if I do n't like who they are they wo n't be accepted because to them that is all that they have . I learned that those people have a selfconcept that is based upon anticipating what others will think of them.And to become as charismatic as those I most admire I 've learned that by first accepting everything about myself I am free to emulate them without losing myself.This little book has so much information for anyone who desires to be their best.Read this book to become more than comfortable in your own skin .

"I have been reading through this book and while it says some true things it seems very judgmental especially in the section about games people play .

"This is a very perceptive book in which John Powell looks at healthy and unhealthy ways of relating . He starts off with an excerpt from an actual conversation in which someone told him & # 8220I am afraid to tell you who I am because if I tell you who I am you may not like who I am and it & # 8217s all that I have. & # 8221 He says this reflects & # 8220the imprisoning fears and selfdoubt which cripple most of us and keep us from forward movement on the road to maturity happiness and true love. & # 8221Because of these fears and because of the risks of self revelation people seek refuge in roles masks and games and these are examined in detail in this book . They are ways of relating without true communication . However as Powell puts it & # 8220A relationship will be only as good as its communication. & # 8221Powell says it is helpful to learn about the games people play in order to have honest communication in true interpersonal relationships . He states that it is only when we are able to express ourselves and relate to others that we are & # 8220fully human. & # 8221He talks of the importance of & # 8220Interiority & # 8221 in which people accept their emotions impulses thoughts and desires . & # 8220This kind of selfacceptance empowers people to live fully and confidently with all that goes on inside them. & # 8221On the other side of the balance is & # 8220exteriority & # 8221 which involves an openness to meaningful contact with the world outside . & # 8220Fully human beings go out to others & # 8230 not by a kind of compulsiveobsessive neurosis but actively and freely and simply because they have chosen to do so. & # 8221Powell talks about the five levels of communication which range from Clich & eacute conversation such as the small talk used at cocktail parties to Peak Conversation which is based on absolute openness and honesty . As Powell affirms & # 8220Anyone who builds a relationship on less than openness and honesty is building on sand. & # 8221Of great interest is the chapter on Egodefense mechanisms in which various methods are examined . One of these is & # 8220Reaction Formation & # 8221 which is an overcompensation by exaggeration . Powell explains that exaggerated behavior usually means the opposite of what it seems to imply . Another egodefense mechanism is Projection in which we attribute our own faults to others and & # 8220dislike in others what we can not accept in ourselves. & # 8221Powell advocates honesty at all times . & # 8220Even if my thoughts and emotions are not pleasing to you it remains the greatest kindness to reveal myself openly and honestly. & # 8221However Powell is careful to clarify that the honesty he is talking about is selfrevelation not judgement of other people . He says that when one person is honest about themselves it will empower the other to do the same.The final section of the book is a catalogue of games and roles that people play . Powell introduces the section by saying that all the games and roles have one thing in common & # 8220they mask and distort the truth about the one most important thing that I could share with you myself. & # 8221 They are all ways of avoiding reality and they are played in order to gain acceptance by others . Powell reflects & # 8220No one wants to admit to playing any one of these games but it is the first step to real emotional growth when we admit the tendency in order to hold it in some kind of check. & # 8221For anyone who wishes to learn how to relate and what pitfalls to steer away from this is essential reading . Definitely to be added to your reading list . ",4
"If I expose my nakedness as a person to you do not make me feel shame . I am afraid to tell you who I am because if I tell you who I am you may not like who I am and it 's all I have.I read this book in 1991 not knowing then that the author was just another priestly perv and came away from reading it with the idea that if you are seeking a real and authentic relationship you need to put into practice gutlevel communication . Who am I ? I am what I think what I judge and what I feel . If I have communicated these things freely and openly as clearly and as honestly as I can I will find a noticeable growth in my own sense of identity.Displacement is the indirect expression of an impulse that is scapegoating . Reactionformation is extreme dogmatism prudishness overcompensation by overdevelopment or exaggeration out of fear and demoralizing selfdoubt . Introjection is where we attribute to ourselves the good qualities of others . Rationalization is the attempt to reconcile our ideal selves with our real selves . Displacement reactionformation introjection and rationalization are obstacles to being honest and open in our communications . ",3

Some serious introspective of the human mind and soul.One of he most entertaining parts of the book was the section of the personality types . By way of explanation the writer describes people who like the Clown the Lifeofthe party the dictator the sex kitten the stud the authoritarian etc etc . It is very extensive and you may even find yourself on one of the pages.In a nutshell recommended reading . ",4

"I like the subject matter it is the way the book is written that I do notcare for . I feel like the author is not talking to me rather he is talkingat me . ",2
"This book does have some worthy insights however the author tends to pigeonhole people into oversimplified categories according to the games they play to get their needs met . In real life however I think people are more likely to fall into various roles or games at different times in their lives . Something about the presentation seemed just a little pretentious too . The author sometimes appeared to think he was giving away some secret bits of information heretofore known only by him or a few select others . This left a bad taste in my mouth . Nonetheless some of the information presented was very valid and at the very least the book serves as an excellent reminder that we are all afraid of rejection no matter who we are . But we are not all losers in spite of the games we play I do n't think the author gives enough emphasis to this fact . In addition I think that sometimes life is just what it is and looking at it like it is some kind of game is of no useful value whatsoever . Watch out if you think you are having some kind of aha ! experience as it will be shortlived . ",2

"Any person who desires to understand himself in regard to personal growth and relationship with others must read this book . I have read and reread this book and use it to counsel others . Powell deals with the topic of human growth and development with acute precision and accuracy that informs a picture of the wellintegrated whole individual . He communicates this person in the honor of the image of God not in a preachy tone but such as to reflect the dignity of humankind and his own vast understanding in religion and classical studies . He also touches at the nerve of why individuals mask themselves from others and the care and caution that we as counselors need to take in dealing with these people . His catalog of games and roles is so descriptive that even emotionally healthy persons can identify the weakend emotional tendencies that characterize their life . The principles in this book can be communicated to adolescent and adult alike . Simply indispensable . ",4

"I have always loved to read C.S . Lewis and these readings are well done in that they contain great ideas that 'work ' for a daily reading . ",4
"I enjoy C.S . Lewis in general but these early writing from his Christian walk are truly poetic and picturesque . He transcends base knowledge and seems to be able to convey in words concepts that dig deeply to the core of the nature of God . Beautiful ! ! ",4
"Of course in an ideal world where we all had tons of free time to read a book of C.S . Lewis excerpts like this would be useless . But in the actual world where sometimes reading has to come next to things like working grocery shopping and sleeping a book like this one is quite helpful . It does n't compare to reading each of his great works in their entirety but the excerpts are organized very well often by theme andor work taken from so there 's a feeling of continuity and thoroughness . Another great thing about this book is that often with C.S . Lewis ' works the density of things to think about within the pages is so great that a lot of the cool thoughts and ideas get missed in a normal readthrough . But generally in this book each daily reading expresses a singular idea so there is more time to really let the weight of the thought sink in and to spend some time intellectually and emotionally digesting his words . So if you 're a C.S . Lewis fan or even just a fan of filling your brain with interesting concepts and insightful analogies this is a musthave . ",3
"I bought this book in 2001 and have read it more or less every night before bed . These one or twoparagraph tidbits are great for something spiritual to ponder before bed . It also inspired me to read the books that these snippets are taken from . If you 're looking for an organized progressive devotional there are better books out there but if you 're new to C.S . Lewis and would like to see some of the width and breadth of his writing this might be a good place to start . ",4
"Lewis does a masterful job of leading you to ponder much of life and how it will affect your enjoyment of heaven . He does n't want you to just read words but to think as you read in a way that will affect you life and help you affect your world you presently live in . ",4
"I have tried assorted devotional books before but I have never been satisfied . All too often commentaries on specific Bible passages seem to conflict with the very passage they are trying to explain or illustrate and devotional works which are intended to stand on their own tend to be too sicklysweet for me or have questionable theology from time to time.But of course this is C.S . Lewis . Walter Hooper has arranged some of Lewis ' pithier passages into a series roughly paralleling the Church Year as observed by Anglicans . I read it in parallel with my own Bible reading and was somewhat bemused to find how often what Lewis wrote meshed with what I was reading in the Bible even though I made no attempt to coordinate or harmonise the two . This is a devotional book with which I can be satisfied . ",4
"As part of my time with God each day I have a spiritual diet of Bible reading memorization and then books on theologysermonsbiographies of men of God etc . I also like to do small daily snippets of devotionals quotes readings so on and so forth.The book that I have used for this section of my devotionals the past year is The Business of Heaven by C. S. Lewis . Now to be clear on this Lewis never wrote this book as such . The book is a collection of the man 's writings one for each day of the year plus a small separate group of selections for the special movable feasts and fasts of the Episcopal Calendar . This way every day and most special religious observances have such a reading to commemorate them.Really these selections are more like thoughts of the day that are taken from Lewis ' writings . To their credit the editors put real work into the book . Each reading really does encapsulate a thought or an idea that is Scripturallybased . While it is true that I found myself disagreeing once or twice with Lewis ' perspective it was on an issue that pertained to doctrinal or historical interpretation . In other words an issue that Christians have debated for the past two millennia and will debate until Our Lord returns in all likelihood.Lewis was known for some more wacky views upon salvation though they became increasingly orthodox as he studied the Scriptures more . None of the more wacky ones are here . This is not a study in Lewis or a book drawing attention to Lewis but a book of Lewis ' quotes designed to do what he himself wanted done with his works to draw attention to Our Wondrous God.Highly Recommended .

"I JUST LOVE CS LEWIS . IN THIS BOOK I HAVE FOUND A VERITABLE FEAST OF INTELLECTUAL CHALLENGES THAT SHAKE MY PREDISPOSED ATTITUDES AND HANGUPS TOWARD GOD AND MAN .

IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT LIFE CAN BRING AND DO N'T MIND YOUR PREDILECTIONS TOWARD THE ETERNAL BEING DISTURBED CHALLENGED AND CHANGED THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU . ",4
"Let me be up front with my feelings about this bookI have a serious lack of trust for the editor.After reading Kathryn Lindskoog 's book Light in the Shadowlands Protecting the Real C.S . Lewis see my review on October 30 2000 I have deep concerns about Mr. Hooper . My consequent suggestion is that you skip the introduction if you use this book.The real attraction here is the ability to read short excerpts from C.S . Lewis ' works every day . As a whole this book is great for fulfilling that purpose.I believe that I have lamented elsewhere that Christianity suffers from a plague of superficial and shallow devotionals . In spite of Mr. Hooper having had a hand in its creation and the lion 's share of its profits no doubt The Business of Heaven suffers from neither malady.These passages are excellent to reflect upon . Sometimes they stand alone . Sometimes several days reflect upon the same subject . They follow the Anglican Church Calendar for the year Mr. Lewis was himself a member of the Church of England.As a person who is unfamiliar with the Church Year I found this collection an education of sorts . The book contains charts for folks like me who need to figure out where the movable feasts fall on the calendar They have their own readings in the back.The Business of Heaven is an interesting volume . I give it my recommendation in spite of my reservationsthere are clearly better devotionals out there . I would suggest Brennan Manning 's Reflections for Ragamuffins as a more worthy first choice .

"This is a very good sampling of C.S . Lewis ' writings on many different topics from various previously published sources broken up into digestible pieces . If you 've read most of Lewis ' work and want to refresh your memory and meditate variously on their insights this book might be helpful . It might also be helpful for those who have very little exposure to Lewis and want to start with a shallow sampling before deciding where to dive in deeper . Each selection has its source listed in the back . Please do go on to read some of the original sources . A sampling like this does n't really do them justice.The only criticism I have of this book is about its format . It 's intended to be a devotional calendar with a reading for each specific date of a year with appropriate readings for special days in the church year . I do n't think it succeeds very well in this format . For one thing the selections for the special days do n't always seem relevant . The feast of St. Andrew for example on November 30 does n't have anything to do with that particular Apostle . But the main reason it does n't seem to work well as a devotional calendar is that long passages are often broken up into a sequence of separate sequential readings that span several days . If you stick to reading each selection one day at a time you could easily lose the train of thought and have to pick it up again each day . There is no hint as to where one broken up passage ends and another begins unless you look at the list of sources in the back . I think the book would work much better if it were simply organized by topic into series of passages of varying lengths without trying to fit them in a daily calendar template . ",2
"Your daily dose of cognizant reason will be found in these pages . Good and relevant stuff about life . The amazing work of a mind like very few to have ever lived ! And he bothers to try to bring these things to my level of thinking ! ",4
"Fair warning Every bite of Lewis ' writing makes you long for more . Addictive yes ! Each of these daily readings will grab you and keep you thinking and looking to God long after you 've put the book down . That is a perfect example of what every Christian writer hopes for That God 's Spirit will inhabit your words and bring them to life in the hearts and minds of readers . Lewis is the one writer who always leaves me stunned and awed and whispering thanks to the God who is The Word . ",4
"This is a nice collection of readings from C.S . Lewis edited by Walter Hooper . However it suffer from the same illness that most if not all daily readings text suffer lack of total context.The topics of the readings range from 'Aquinas ' to 'When the World Drama Ends . ' As he always Lewis writes with precision clarity most Latin scholars do.As far as merely a readings text it is hard to go wrong with Lewis he is one of the greatest thinkers from the 20th century . However if you purchase this text with the intention of having a devotional work then you might be disappointed . Do n't misunderstand me Lewis ' writings are quite devotional in one sense but are quite rigorous which runs contrary to most if not all devotional work . This would be more of a serious food for thought work.However if you are wanting a broad spectrum of Lewis ' thought wrapped up in small 'tidbits ' then you will love this work but keep the lack of context in mind it is always best to read the whole and not just a part to gain a full grasp of what any writer is trying to say . I would also recommend Lewis ' Of Other Worlds Essays and Stories . ",3
"CS Lewis is a very interesting and profound theologian and writer . His very deep writings are hard for me to absorb in big chunks so these daily bites are great . Good way to start the day ! ",4
"This book hits the mark as interesting and easy to read . The pictures are a bonus for any Christie fan . ",4
"Very good book describing private life with very interesting background historical descriptions . Agatha Christe must have had an excellect memory it seems to remember so may things from her childhood and all adult life . However Agatha Christie did not reveal many things from her life . This is not a book through which you will know her . But it is very interesting to read it . ",3
"Some of Agatha Christie 's fans may complain that this autobiography does not tell them the things they really want to know such as why Christie briefly disappeared after her first husband confessed his infidelity or how one can write successful mystery stories.But near the conclusion of this book Christie herself says I have remembered I suppose what I wanted to remember many ridiculous things for no reason that makes sense . 548 It is better then to take this work not as autobiography per se but as a long memoir touching in turn on those aspects of Christie 's life that most interested her . Christie 's life had its disappointments even tragedies but from the first sentence in which she boasts of a happy childhood Christie revels in emphasizing those aspects of the past she enjoyed in the interest of engaging and amusing her readers as well . Some of her anecdotes are laughaloud funny.There are no profound ideas here and only the most superficial touch on philosophy and religion . Her hobby was collecting houses . True Christie does n't tell all and does n't tell deeply but what she does tell is expressed with that wonderful eye for detail that made her a master storyteller the bestselling fiction writer of all time . ",3
"Sure reading Agatha Christie is a bit of escapism to see if you can guess the killer solve the puzzle but I think she 's a bit better than that . Let 's ask another question . Why read books at all ? I liked him very much . He was gentle and politeand he knew a lot really . Things out of books I mean . That 's one reason why we may read but what about novels why read those ? Those are not books in the sense of learning things . OK maybe you can fudge the category and point and include novels at least classic novels that seem to have lessons or wisdom in them but detective stories ? It 's hard to include those herein too . But at least in Miss Christie 's case I 'd make an exception here even though on the surface detective stories mysteries do n't merit inclusion in the books the likes of Dickens and Dostoyesky wrote . Sherlock Holmes and many other detective stories I 'd suggest are a lot more escapism in the simple sense of that phrase . And while many good books have nuggets of insight and interest in them I think Agatha Christie consistently has more than several in most of her books . Man in the Brown suit A diary is useful for recording the idiosyncrasies of other peoplebut not one 's own . Mrs. McGinty 's Dead What a wonderful dispensation it is of Nature 's though Hercule Poirot that every man however superficially unattractive should be some woman 's choice . Murder of Roger Ackroyd Les femmes generalized Poirot they are marvelous ! They invent haphazardand by miracle they are right . Not that it is that really . Women observe subconsciously a thousand little details without knowing that they are doing so . Their subconscious mind adds these little things togetherand they call the result intuition.Take this from Mrs. McGinty 's DeadI do n't see what you mean.Poirot Perhaps I do not see myselfnot yet . One works through darkness towards light.Poirot You look forwards not back ? 'Deidre I do n't know that I look anywhereI mean today 's usually enough is n't it ? Lines that these make passing international flights more bearable . That 's why I like to read Christie on long flights . You read things like this and put your finger between the pages you have just read cast a glance out the window 35000 feet above daily life and contemplate it for a few minutes . Hmm interesting she is Agatha Christie 's take on things . It 's not deep philosophy but food for casual thoughtif you pause long enough when reading her to savor these gems . As in travel the journey is often more interesting than the d & eacutenouement of the trip . So Agatha Chrisite is a great writer ? I 'm not saying that and Agatha Christie never pretended to be I will confess here and now that of the two things that have excited me most in my life the first was my car my grey bottlenosed Morris Cowley . The second was dining with the Queen at Buckingham Palace about forty years later . Both of these happenings you see had something of a fairytale quality about them . They were things that I thought could never happen to me to have a car of my own and to dine with the Queen of England . Agatha Christie in other words was rather normal . And it was interesting to read this autobiography to see just how normal she was even though she once did have a doctor called Stabbhow apropo . I rather just enjoy reading Christie and enjoy the way she characterizes people and life normal life . Normal is goodas long as a person at least tries to look at things a bit differently sometimes . Agatha Christie always had a fresh way of looking at things . Too bad other normal people often have nothing to say . ",3
"I was a bit hesitant to read this at first . Knowing that it didnt cover her eleven missing days made me think it was essentially dishonest . But instead I found it really enjoyable . It 's better written than most of her novels . It 's a string of loosely related anecdotes that are really quite entertaining . Most interesting is her remembrance of her Victorian childhood and Edwardian young adulthood and her ability to contrast it with the midtwentieth century . For example she mentions that when she first married everyone thought it extremely extravagant to have a car but it was unthinkable for her class not to have servants . Interesting how fashions come and go about what it considered a necessity ! ",3
"There are really 3 autobiographical works that Agatha Christie wrote there 's this one of course which if I remember right covers her childhood and the early years of her first marriage including how she began writing . Then there 's Come Tell Me How You Live about the 2nd part of her life during her marriage to the archeologist Max Mallowan.Then there 's the novel written under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott Unfinished Portrait . Although many things in Unfinished Portrait were clearly changed around for the sake of the story and do n't pertain to her life at all it is very frank emotionally about what was probably the hardest time of her life her divorce from her 2nd husband . It also tells a little more about her writing since the heroine of the story is also a writer.All 3 of the books are good reading . ",3
"Interesting to read of her life . I found it a bit repetitive and that it dwelt too long on details of her childhood . ",2
"Agatha Christie is still the only true Queen of Crime . Her creations of Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot are still as fresh and popular as when she was alive . Her immense popularity is in still contrast to the shyness she showed when in contact with the media . She kept her personal life very much hidden from the general public and mostly avoided giving interviews.It is then even more refreshing that her autobiography published in 1977 the year after her death shares so many intimate thoughts and ponderings . Although it does not reveal all the mysteries behind the enigmatic author she fails for instance to mention her sudden disappearance in 1926 it shows what a wonderfully strange life she has lived . The years of the war are covered in great detail and it is clear that that period was a big turning point in her life . In comparison Agatha does not spend a lot of time on how her writings came about a lack she mentions in the introduction as being a conscience decision . More focus has been put on how she sees the world around here evolve . As such this work is very much like a historical impressionistic painting of the world of Agatha Christie . The humor she interweaves through her narrative makes clear that she was always very aware of how relative her success and position in live has been . Something that is completely in line with her humble and shy character.Agatha Christie An Autobiography is a very personal and touching book that should be on the shelve of every Christie fan and is a real joy to read . ",4
"I have read just about every one of Agatha Christie 's books and so I thought I would probably enjoy this too . Miss Christie led a very interesting life and I am so glad that I decided on this book . It was amazing to read of the times that she came up in and she was so descriptive you almost feel you are there . Naturally she is able to weave a very readable story and she keeps it interesting all the way through . I also enjoyed the pictures that are included . I hate that she did not have more books because I only have two or three more of them to go . If you like Miss Christie 's work you will enjoy discovering how she became the world 's best crime writer . ",4
"This is a reprint of Agatha Christie 's autobiography over a period between 1950 and 1965 . Out of print for over three decades this new edition includes a CD in which Agatha Christie talks about being a writer . Note that the famous elevenday disappearance in 1926 see the movie Agatha for speculation is not explained which in turn is disappointing yet adds an aura of mystery to Ms. Christie . Born in 1890 her late Victorian childhood in Ashfield comes across as idyllic but somewhat boring except for her vivid description of her caring indolent dad and the Agatha 's Husband game played with her sister . The action picks up in the second act with her first marriage to Archibald Christie their child Rosalind and her first novel . Her second marriage to younger Max Mallowan during the Depression also provides insight into what made Ms. Christie tick while her characters like Poirot and Marple almost seem real . Ironically readers know of her novels but few have seen her plays like Witness for the Prosecution on the stage . At times in her works Ms. Christie sympathizes with murderers as their cause was just see Murder on the Orient Express which is intriguing . Filled with pathos and humor and enhanced by photos and the CD An Autobiography by Agatha Christie is a wonderful look at the life of the Grand Dame of mystery.Harriet Klausner ",4
"This is a must have for any Agatha Christie lover . While I am not yet finished reading I am finding it quite intriguing and finding her personal life just as adventureous as her novels . I was delighted to find this comes with a CD of her voice recordings from over the years . ",4
"If you 're a fan of Ms. Christieand even if you aren'tthis book is a gem for writers of the mystery genre . Many of the feelings she expresses are ones we all feel . For example she did n't consider herself a professional writer until she 'd published several books and realized she could pay for her roof repairs . I have a new respect for the woman and her body of work . Starting to read more of her books after reading this . ",4
"Often times autobiographies are dull things of interest only to the author or those who may be mentioned in the book others are glowing brag fests relating how marvelous the subject is or are filled with juicy gossip about other celebrities . This one is completely different in that Christie did not attempt to write a complete chronicle of her life or to focus on what the public might want to hear in fact she deliberately left out the very episode her disappearance that most would want to know more about but instead told about those parts of her life that she was interested in remembering . For example most autobiographies rush through the subject 's childhood and focus on the parts of their adult life that made them famous not so here . Instead Christie takes the first third of her tale to describe her life before she ever thought of Hercule Poirot.What the reader gets instead of stories about the great and famous is a charming glimpse into the life of a middleclass child born at the end of the Victorian era her perceptions of a society that was rapidly changing as she grew to young adulthood . She tells about her life as a child in a comfortable household filled with servants her teenage years with her widowed mother as a young woman caring for wounded soldiers as a bride then a single mother through her later years as a successful author and her second happier marriage to an archaeologist and their travels to the Middle East . She glosses over meeting the Queen but tells at length about various nannies and secretaries that were part of her everyday life.For fans of Christie it is particularly interesting to learn what inspired certain of her characters or plots what was occuring in her life while writing some of the novels to see people or situations that one can recognize in a favorite novel . For anyone interested in life in the early twentieth century this book also gives an insight into that time that is rarely seen . ",4
"Wonderful book for mystery writers and nonfans alike . Agatha Christie could have held her own with any of the British intelligentsia of her day if she had chosen to write anything but puzzlers . By turns funny poignant and practical she had a girlhood almost impossible to imagine in this century . Becoming rich and famous while remaining so unassuming she could n't speak in public she must have been a great dinner guest . I 've read it three times and will probably read it again . ",4
"This is the second time I 've read it . Extremely readable and pleasant book . Fascinating description of life in her times . You get to know the Queen of Crime on a personal level and it makes you like Her even more . A must ! ",4
"I just downloaded this ebook offered by HarperCollins and was dismayed to find that there were absolutely NO pictures included ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I was extremely disappointed that in this day and age a complete version of this work would not be offered by a major publisher . I checked a copy of the original book published by Dodd Mead in 1977 and available for FREE from my public library and found that it included 26 photos . . . sooooo . . . where 's the pics ? ? ? Just another example of the greed by major publishers to rush a product in an eformat and think that no one would notice . . . what a ripoff ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Beware of what is offered in ebooks . . I do love having the accessibility . . . but not at the cost of content . ",1
"I am actually amazed that I never read Agatha Christie 's autobiography before now since I have loved her books and reread them many times over the years.She was born in 1890 in Devon England and died in 1976 in Oxfordshire England . She started this autobiography when she was 60 and finished it when she was 75 . And just to make sure people do n't get disappointed right away her publishers state flatly in the preface of the edition that I own that she does not EVER mention the infamous disappearance the year her mother died and Archie Christie asked her for a divorce . That will be a mystery never solved . You get the sense that she left quite a bit of her emotions and feelings out of the book . She mentioned frequently in the book that bad times were to be got through so that one could enjoy the good times.The book does ramble on delightfully as she herself would probably put it . What I want is to plunge my hand into a lucky dip and come up with a handful of assorted memories . from the Foreward . Here 's a critical paragraph about how one should view her autobiographyWe never know the whole man though sometimes in quick flashes we know the true mam . I think myself that one 's memories represent those moments which insignificant as they may seem nevertheless represent the inner self and oneself as most really oneself . also from the Forward.There is an amazing amount of detail regarding Victorian and Edwardian England . Her ability to describe things minutely and interestingly was one of the things I always loved about her books.The main outlines of her life are there as are quite a few details about her family . She loved her family immensely and it shows . She discusses her father 's lack of business skills that wasted away the fortune he inherited and her brother Monty 's wholly unsatisfactory life in the straightforward way that she wrote her books . She was an extremely practical person I think.Her interest in archaeology because of her 2nd husband Max Mallowan manifested itself in quite a few of her books and I think that perhaps some of my interest in archaeology was because of her interest . She had one daughter Rosalind who died in 2004 and a grandson Mathew Prichard who runs the family business as it were.There are a few preachy parts and I would like to have had more dates but she warns you in the Foreward and you must simply sit back and let her tell her story and understand her the way she wanted to be understood.The book ends before her husband Max Mallowan was knighted for his distinguished archaeological career in 1968 and before she herself was appointed a dame of the British Empire in 1971 . Truly an interesting woman truly an interesting autobiography . ",3
"Curious about AC this book taught a lot . A bit disappointing to find how much she really did not like writing about Poirot after a while but had heard of that and not a huge surprise . Her life as a child through to her second and final marriage and her children . Interesting to find out about her great imagination even as a child how her family traveled for safety money fun the family challenges . ",4
"For anyone who has ever read and enjoyed Agatha Christie and wondered about the author this is a must . You get an indepth look at her younger years and her parents . What a pair they must have been ! You also get a strong sense of the times just prior to World War I . You meet many of the people she met along the way and which ones had a strong impact on her . She does not got into any depth as to her ideas for stories and book nor does she go in for how she writes them . That is for other authors . I literally sometimes could not close the book for wanting to know what came next . I still go back to parts of the book to reread them . The story unfolds just as easily as any of her books . ",4
"Although I generally believe that the one story a writer should n't write is their own Agatha Christie 's autobiography is the happy exception to this rule.The famous mystery writer takes much of the mystery out of how she became a writer telling a straightforward story of a fairytale childhood that abruptly changed into a grownup existence of uncertainty hardwork determination pluck and verve . She admits to less ambition than necessity dictated by money and marriage woes.Christie is a natural storyteller but she is far too polite to admit it outright . Instead she brings the same handsoff style to her own story as she does to the main characters in her mystery books that of being caught up in the circumstances of events rather than being driven by them.Her life story gently unfolds complemented by a dry and selfeffacing wit . Christie blends in tidbits of her writing life including her early efforts story and character inspirations why her books are so short her writing style and routine and her dealings with editors and publishing houses into the mostly personal narrative.While it may be a mystery as to whether Christie created or responded to opportunities there 's no mystery that once those opportunities presented themselves Christie seized them and rode them spectacularly to fame and fortune .

"For me this book is rated 5 stars and the only other book that I rate this much is the Autobiography of Nelson Mandela ! Even if Nelson Mandela was extrovert and I feel usually more inspired by extrovert people than by introvert one Agatha Christie this book is amazingly beautiful and for me is a full source of positive inspiration for life.I have never read her novels or any crimi but her life story is just very inspiring ! Thanks for the book Agatha ! ",4
"I first encountered Agatha Christie 's book when I was in high school back in the early 1980s . They were the first mystery novels I 'd ever read and I 've been a mystery fan ever since.I bought my copy of An Autobiography in a used book shop off a clearance table . I think I paid a quarter for it . I knew that she had written an autobiography but was n't sure that I wanted to read it . But hey for a quarter ? Count me in.Christie 's memoir reads much like any of her mystery novels simply written in plain language . Christie was never a writer who wrote with wordy flourishing literary pretensions . She wrote to tell a story . Her memoir is very much the same.As I think other 's have pointed out there 's little mention of Christie 's famous disappearance it 's briefly mentioned . She has little recall of the details . I think that she was a person going though a bad time a divorce and all the publicity that went with it being famous makes your private life very public . I think she was just emotionally exhausted and needed some time to be on her own . Of course the fact that she was a famous mystery writer who disappeared has given rise to all sorts of theories over the years.I 'd not call this the best autobiography I 've ever read . It 's rather slow in parts . However reading about her process of writing and how she came up with some of the ideas for her stories makes for interesting reading . Also interesting is her tales of traveling to Egypt with her archeologist husband her second husband.Overall the book gives us a glimpse into the life and mind of the bestselling mystery writer of all time .

"When I found out this one existed I had to scoop it up . To read about the infamous Agatha Christie 's life in her own words ? Priceless.A hefty length at 560 pages Christie took her time writing this one at leisure and a year after her death her daughter published it posthumously . The style is her traditional formal tone but she also tells her tale as one would having conversations with friends . It 's clear from the beginning that she highly valued her childhood home Ashfield . In fact a great bulk of the book is spent discussing details of her childhood and growing up . It 's clear she remembers these times fondly and places much emphasis on the value of family and experiences as one ages . She recounts the smallest of details that I personally would n't be able to remember . It 's clear she loved having imagination and playing make believe games with her miniature house designs and dolls.She begins the book with her love of Ashfield and ends it with a last visit to where Ashfield once stood . It 's gone and she still was missing it seeing all the differences and changes while finding a small familiar spot she could still recognize . She placed a lot of value on locations travel and houses . None spoke to her like her childhood home it does n't seem . She was a collector of houses in fact at one time owning seven at once ! She speaks in detail of her parents her sister her nannies and the maid her first travels and dances the fashions of the Victorian time and her interests and loves for music and singing art and beauty learning French and the trials and experiences of various schooling . Her parents financial burden only strengthened after her father passed away . She spent time recalled a lot of miniscule details for over a hundred pages during all this but also injecting a lot of philosophy about several things.Interesting how Christie sees servants of her days versus of today and how important they were . She said she could n't imagine her childhood being so full without her nanny and kitchen maid . Apparently they added much warmth and experience to her life and she feels they were highly respected and even controlling of the household.Also interesting to note her feeling of approval for how the Victorian era viewed their children 's capabilities versus today where parents automatically feel their children should be able to shine at everything because of opportunity which she does not agree with . She basically says in that day parents would recognize what their children would be good at and not find it limiting but instead realistic.Here 's a quote from the book I likedI suppose it is because nearly all children go to school nowadays and have things arranged for them that they seem so forlornly unable to produce their own ideas.If you want to read this one to see how she came up with ideas for her stories or even much details about writing you will likely be disappointed . I 'm not sure when closing this book whether Christie even enjoyed writing that much . It definitely was n't her first choice of career she felt she was not good enough to be a professional musician but says it 's best to be realistic with yourself and not do something mediocre if you ca n't shine at it . She does n't even start talking about writing and books until much later on she finally starts writing and sells her first book at page 283 ! Even when starts publishing she mainly discusses other things such as travel and friends . She mentions Miss Marple maybe twice in the book Hercule Poirot rarely . I was hoping for perhaps a word of two about her apparent dislike of having to depend so much on that detective but it was n't really there . Every time she returned to writing it was only to try and make extra money from the way she makes it sound . Later on she said she was writing for money still and wanting to concentrate more on plays for enjoyment after finishing her obligatory novel of the year . She did say she was proud of herself for Ten Little Indians and how she considers it her most complex work.Since she went into so much detail with your youth she tells of each man she almost married or cared for and finally for her fiance and eventual husband Archie Christie . It 's clear she loved him dearly and they had a good relationship for quite awhile . The big controversy of her disappearance for fourteen days where some people thinks she faked her own death was not mentioned AT ALL . Where it would be in a timetable she makes a point to say she is writing about what she wants to write about and not dwell on unpleasantries.One of the best things about this book was an honest inspection of the times lifestyles and thought processes of the Victorian Age . It 's clear Agatha loved being a part of all that . Her travel stories were intriguing some of the time but honestly grew a bit dull as she spent hundreds of pages just talking about locations travel the plants of the area and her enthusiasm for it.When it came closer to mid life she stopped being personal and took a distant approach with the rest of the autobiography . The reason could be her dislike of media and desiring privacy or else because travels was the most important thing in her life which it seemed to be and she thought the best thing to do was write about her wonderful experiences.Overall some great moments and insights . It took me awhile however as some parts of it are a little dull . I also feel she left a lot of her personal life out and kept herself distant in the second half . It would have been great to read more about her writing and characters and the individual books as well . Overall a must for Christie fans and autobiography enthusiasts . ",3
"I want to say up front that I 'm a HUGE Christie fan I 've read everything that she wrote over 80 mysteries plays and her Mary Westmacott pseudonym stuff . However I was very disappointed in this her autobiography for multiple reasons which I will elaborate upon here in detail.First she utterly fails to discuss her famous 11day disappearance in 1926 to the Harrogate Spa which is probably the most intriguing thing that ever happened in her lifetime ! Here I 'll cite a website But Norman a former doctor believes the novelist was in a fugue state or more technically a psychogenic trance a rare deluded condition brought on by trauma or depression which may also have led the writer and actor Stephen Fry to travel to Bruges in 1995 without leaving word with his friends or family.Okay I 'm Hoyle with that there was a Hollywood movie that implied that she was having an affair which I did not necessarily accept as truth but why leave such an important event out of an autobiography that is certain to be of huge interest to fans ? My second criticism is more pointed . Over the years Christie issued MANY racist comments in her various works . I wo n't repeat them here as all fans will know what I 'm talking about . Now this was COMMON for writers to do throughout the 20th Century so on it 's face taking into account that this was an acceptable practice for the era I do n't condemn Christie for this initial act of making such comments even though many did not benefit or lend real support to the dialogue.However Christie died in 1976 and this autobiography was published in '77 . By this time racist commentary was being very much looked down upon as it should have been and Christie could have made some sort of positive overture however minor to say that she wished that she had not used certain words that were hurtful to people . No such apology however minor is found in this autobiography that I could find and I feel certain that by 1976 Christie had received many letters which pointed out these anachronistic racial comments probably seeking some sort of reaction . Based upon the absence of such thoughts in her autobiography I seriously doubt that any response was issued . I find that a sad omission.Finally as I read this book I got the distinct impression that her heart was not at all in writing it that it was a drudgery of sorts . I do n't blame her for not wanting to write it but if she did n't want to do it she should have simply not done it rather than issue something that reflects a sort of sideways contempt for her millions of fans.Here 's what I DID like about the work I learned a great deal about little things that ended up in her mysteries such as Truelove . I learned something of her family not enough about her trials and tribulations in marriage though and I went away sort of feeling sorry for Christie 's father . Beyond these things she came off as pretty drab to me my expectations were so much higher as she had been a worldtraveler and COULD have said so much more . I found that the whole thing lacked a sense of history.So I 'll no doubt take some hits for my review and if I 'm in error about my facts I 'll come back and make corrections but I just think it could have been a super work and compared to other autobiographies that I 've read I found this one dull and lacking in honesty.I have a tendency to overrate the media which I review but I ca n't go along with the crowd on this one . Perhaps I 'm wrong in that they say you should review what 's IN a book and not what is absent . I 'm not certain about that but I welcome your sincere feedback and comments . ",1
"Regardless of whether you are a lover of mystery fiction you will love this autobiography by arguably the most successful mystery writer of all time . Agatha Christie led a fascinating life during an enormously eventful time in history . Born during the reign of Queen Victoria she lived served and worked through two World Wars and through the major events of the 20th century and all of her experiences are captured in her novels and in this wonderful autobiography . Mrs. Christie tells her story vividly and with great emotion and truly captures in this eminently readable and humorous work a feeling for the events that shaped and the people who populated her world.This is a new edition of a longtime favorite book that I reread and share with others on a regular basis . I am always inspired by Mrs. Christie 's indomitable spirit and courage and her positive outlook even during dark times of war illness financial worry and grief all of which she handles with great dignity in her work.The great bonus in this new edition is the CD of Dame Agatha dictating portions of her work . It is absolutely fascinating to hear her clear and lovely voice at work and provides additional insight into her writing process and indeed to her personality . ",4
"First let me say that Agatha Christie 's autobiography is one of my alltime favorite books . That 's why I purchased the Kindle version when I already own a hard copy.Imagine my disappointment then as I read along the narrative suddenly makes no sense . I 'm not talking about the occasional misprint those are to be expected . No whole paragraphs and sections are simply gone . Is this an abridged version ? Sometimes the text is neatly excised and unless you knew what should have been there you 'd never miss it . Other times it is jarring . For example Mrs. Christie is reflecting on the pleasures of the suqs in Bagdhad and the next page drops into the middle of a conversation about metaphysics with some unnamed person . Whom frantic searches of my hard copy revealed to be Maurice Vickers . Now I do n't know about most but I need context before I can face a discussion of metaphysics on my good days and to find myself suddenly confronted with the meaty middle of a treatise on the philosophical implications of Time and Infinity without a fair warning or time to prepare myself was a terrible shock to the system . Referencing the hard copy and filling in the missing paragraphs made the discussion not only palatable but deeply interesting and even profound.I do n't how many other such errors there are . I do know that as I read a book with which I am fairly familiar I often felt that some things were missing and a superficial comparison of the Kindle and hard copies confirmed that.Agatha Christie 's autobiography is an engrossing journey into the mind of an original and entertaining woman . Its little forays into Victoriana such as the proper books for children to read or suitable names for cooks house maids and parlourmaids and why they were n't the same are charming and fascinating . Her reminiscences of her times on archaeological digs in the middle east are compelling . It 's more than worth reading just not in the Kindle version . ",2
"Agatha Christie perhaps the best known mystery writer of all time did not ever plan on becoming a writer . And when she did become one it took her years to accept this as her profession and to believe that there was something other than money to be gained by writing books . Her autobiography is a pleasant ramble through the fascinating live lived by the creator of those master sleuths Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple . Her life was no mystery but most definitely an adventure.Agatha Christie began writing her life story from her second husband 's archaelogical dig in Iraq . It is set up in a rather rambling manner starting from a brief family history to her earliest childhood memories and on through her life . Throughout these memories are punctuated by various tangents often involving her writings other times not . It is not a straightforward chrononlogical telling of her life but rather like having a pleasant conversation or reading a leader that she has written to her readers . It allows fans of her writing to get to know the woman behind those characters.While not as detalied as some fans might wish for as author and editor Christie has left out some events and rather long it is a pleasing read for any fan of Christie 's stories . I learned much about her life that I did not know including novels she wrote using pseudonyms and took joy in reading her views on social concerns . While the time period she lived in and wrote about may seem long gone Christie 's words prove again and again to be timeless . ",4
"I read this for a book club I 'm in and at first I enjoyed the chatty style . Then for a time I got a little tired of itIn the second half I just loved the story and could hardly wait for what comes next . I read it on the Kindle and it seemed like as a book it would be very long . For me the length was worth it . Very entertaining . ",4
"Agatha Christie 's works have always been my favorites and it was interesting to read her life story or the stories she chose to include . Christie 's enchanting writing style and descriptive narratives drew me in right away . Her self awareness is profound . Great book . ",4
"Agatha Christie chooses to write her autobiography in her own way . She remembers those parts of life she wants to usually those most pleasant . She describes her family and childhood with good feeling and love . She had a very happy childhood and one of the best passages in the book is when she speaks about the happiness she had in small things in everyday life one of the most pleasant being her mother 's reading to her.What has one enjoyed most in life ? I daresay it varies with different people . For my own part remembering and reflecting . It seems that it is almost always the quiet moments of everyday life . Those are the times certainly when I have been happiest . Adorning Nursie 's old grey head with blue bows playing with Tony making a parting with a comb down his broad back alloping on what I feel to be real horses across the river my fancy has set in the garden . Following my hoop through the stations of the Tubular Railway . Happy games withmy mother . My mother later reading Dickens to me gradually getting sleepy her spectactles half falling off her nose and her head dropping forward and myself saying in an agonized voice . Mother you 're going to sleep ' to which my mother with great dignity replies ' Nothing of the kind darling . I am not in the least sleepy ! ' A few minutes later she would be asleep . I remember feeling how ridiculous she looked at her spectacles slipping off her nose and how much I loved her at that moment'.This autobiography is filled with detailed and interesting perceptions of people . It is however a bit marred by her social preaching.One gets from it however a sense of worlds different from our own . Perhaps most memorable is that of her own family home with her whist playing father and her more imaginative mother with the many servants whose perspective on life she understands.She in her own judgment had a very pleasant and happy life despite the hard times especially when her first husband betrayed her in the same year her beloved mother passed away . But the long successful second marriage and the success as a writer perhaps above all the financial success were elements she was much grateful for . She closes most appropriately by thanking God 'for my good life and the love that has been given me ' She concluded the work at the age of seventy five but went on to live for another eleven years .

"I had tried to read the authorized biography of Mrs. Christie written by Janet Morgan but found it too difficult to wend a way through all the facts thrown in . This biography was a welcome change and a book I could n't put down . I 'm sure this will be a book I 'll read again and again . Mrs. Christie 's account of her life is not meant to be all encompassing but rather the things that came to mind as she wrote . She is very honest about her shortcomings and especially wonderful were her thoughts as to her state of mind and thoughts as to why one does certain things . She was very modest about her writing talent.Unlike one reviewer I did n't find it a fault that she did n't address the disappearance event as she clearly writes about her problems after her mother 's death which occurred just previous to her disappearance in which she describes her lack of memory and mental breakdown implying she was going through a nervous breakdown before her husband asked for a divorce and that event must have furthered that condition . I do n't find it difficult to believe that she has little to no memories of that time but in any event I appreciate so much that she took the time to share her thoughts about her life with us and I would have it no other way than the way she chose to write the book . Her writing almost feels as though she is sitting right beside me talking.she is one talented writer.I would recommend this book for anyone interested in Mrs. Christie . For other views of her life i would recommend Richard Hack 's The Unauthorized Biography . as it is well written and will keep one 's attention . Not recommended is Morgan 's Authorized biography as the writer relies so heavily on what Mrs. Christie herself wrote and presenting facts and facts and facts . It is n't a reading book but a book of gathered facts . The best of the lot by far is the biography in Mrs. Christie 's own words . ",4
"Excellent seller service.have no completed read but so far very good read.it is not the usual bio gives you insight into her writing style and topicsIf you have noy read any of her works read this one first ",4
"Reading Agatha Christie 's autobiography was like a long visit with a treasured friend . She lived through very interesting times and her descriptions and remembrances are absolutely priceless ! Her sense of humor is delightful . When I finished it I was sad because it was over . How I wish I had known her when she lived ! I highly recommend this book and not only to those who have enjoyed her novels and plays . This is more than a good read . ",4
"When one of the world 's most eminent historians takes on the single most amazing phenomenon of the century the Holocaust it gives one pause for thought . So here we have Sir Martin Gilbert a noted Holocaust authority writing masterfully about the events leading up to and including the systematic persecution deportation and murder of the Jews of Europe . His stirring and singular narrative is regularly punctuated by a number of poignant and shocking eyewitness accounts of many who lived through those numbing events . The test is extremely approachable and easy to read so that the nonhistorian can appreciate the breadth and scope of his recounting of the events during the 12year reign of terror levied by the National Socialists in Nazi Germany.His approach is chronological much like that employed in his bestselling three volume series on the 20th century . While he relies heavily on established secondary sources for his documentation the power of his prose and his wellorganized approach makes this an entertaining and educational tome to venture into . Although nowhere near as comprehensive as some other tomes such as Klaus Fischer 's History Of An Obsession he does trace the centuries ' long tradition of antiSemitism culminating in the official state sanctioned approach codified in the institutionalized Nuremberg laws . In all this Gilbert brilliantly employs survivor 's recollections to paint the atrocities in the hues and colors of real human beings ordinary and identifiable individuals caught in the insanity of the Third Reich . Furthermore he pursues their individual identities and humanity by giving the reader information on the postwar futures of these people.So much has been written about the Holocaust that it is difficult to imagine much new or novel to arise some fifty years after the end of the war . Yet the stage always remains open for the unusual display of finely crafted historical perspectives and brilliantly executed prose . The brilliance in this dazzling book is as Oscar Schindler would have said in the presentation . Although I have read a number of other books about these times and events that were more detailed more graphic or more comprehensive this is without a doubt the single most impressive cohesive and authoritative volume I have read to date regarding the Holocaust in its enormity and placed in an understandable and comprehensible context . I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in owning the single best onevolume book summarizing and explaining the realities of the Holocaust . ",4
"I feel callous giving this book only 3 stars but I attribute this to it not being what I expected . What I was hoping for was something akin to Anne Applebaum 's Gulag a onevolume history of what happened how it happened why it happened and how it was dealt with when it was over . This book is certainly not that.Instead Gilbert has taken an enormous amount of firsthand experiences and arranged them chronologically to tell an almost daybyday account of the unfathomable brutality experienced by European Jewry . To weave this all together in such a way is masterful but it only tells a part of the story . I assume that was his goal but it leaves me wanting more.Every paragraph has some episode that is unforgettable . It easy to lose sight of the fact that the 6 million murders took place as Judith Miller says one by one by one . This book makes sure you 'll never think of the Holocaust that way again . What Gilbert neglects to cover in much detail is the Nazi part of the story . Of course they are front and center as the perpetrators but little is covered about what ordinary Germans knew . Or how the German culture was ripe ground for this evil to blossom . Or what the millions of valuables stolen were used for . Or how the manpower and resources expended in this psychopathic venture affected the overall war effort . Or what role outside of Eichmann those at the top of the Nazi command played . Again Gilbert obviously was n't trying to tell that part of the story but I still ca n't say I have a true understanding of the Holocaust beside the unbelievable cruelty so many suffered.And this makes me angry at myself at 828 pages after a while you become numb to it all . I stopped being shocked by what I read . I think this is unfortunate but natural . A topic like this is so ghastly that the further we get from WWII the less people will know about it . In our comfortable American lives people do n't want to remember these awful events of the past.Two quotes sum it all up for the book one tells the utter desperation of an entire culture the other the unyielding faith that so many held until the very endThere is no strength left to cry steady and continued weeping leads finally to silence . At first there is screaming then wailing and at last a bottomless sigh that does not leave even an echo . Chaim Kaplan p. 105I have seen them the dregs of human misery and I know that through mankind flows a stream of eternity greater and more powerful than individual deaths . Lena Berg p. 622 ",2
"While reading Shirer 's Third Reich book I wanted to learn more about the Holocaust obviously like most people I know something about it but I wanted more detail so I picked up this book . This book starts off with a very brief history of some antisemitism in Germany starting with some vicious quotes from the hateful Luther I think Luther 's work titled 'On the Jews and their Lies ' should be enough for anyone to question his integrity although granted I 've only read snippets not the entire thing . Then it goes into a massive 900ish pages of event after event of the atrocities committed against the Jews during WWII I find much of it hard to take how could anyone treat a race people like this this reminds me of the worst stories of serial killers yet this was n't a single demented individual but thousands.First I have a few minor complaints I wish the book did a little more background information on WWII and what lead to this secondly the book often gets into a numbers game where it spends many pages giving facts such as x number of people were hauled away this day and murdered I would have preferred less of this numbers presentation . This book gave tons of information for the horrors of the holocaust the mentioning of statistics is countered with lots of personal stories from people who survived or their diaries were later found . Overall I 'd give this book a perfect five stars the few things I 'd change seem minor compared to the stuff that was presented . With that being said I 'm really glad that I 'm done with this book I was in a minor depression for the three weeks I read this . I like to hope that deep down people are better more moral than this systematic slaughter of millions but obviously I 'm wrong . I guess this is what you get when you let hatred take over your common decency . ",4
"Simply the most disturbing book I have ever read in my entire 62 years on this planet . Can only be read in small doses . I thought I knew about the Holocaust before I read this book . I knew nothing . And neither do you if you have n't read this book . My God what horror . No wonder they Jews say NEVER AGAIN ! Now I know why . ",4
"Every country in the world has crime cases that rock the very fabric of their society their values their very humanness . The Holocaust covers a period of many years before during and after WW2 when a civilized nation undertook deeds of humiliation degradation terror torture and murder of European Jewry with such impunity that totally defies human comprehension . This is not an easy book to read the horrors that spring from virtually every paragraph will challenge every notion of the human race been filled with kindness and goodwill . Of the many thousands that shed blood in the villages of Poland and Russia there were millions that looked away as their neighbors and former friends were taken into killing fields or bundled into trucks and trains to death camps . One and a half million children what mind can wrap itself around swinging a baby and smashing its head against a wall or putting a bullet through a child or in fun compete in contests of how many people one bullet could kill ? In the killing fields or burning snynagues of Russia the ghettos of Poland the days of cattlecart transports to the camps of Treblinka and AuschwitzBirkenau survival required miracles . Be warned you are going to require frequent respites from reading the horror of a culture and religion under commissioned terrorization torture enforced abject starvation and blatant murder . Most likely this was humanities darkest years it makes the Spanish Inquisition read like a teddybears ' picnic . ",4
"While I have read a few books written by Holocaust survivors I wanted to read a comprehensive history of the Holocaust which was written by a respected historian . I achieved that goal by reading Martin Gilbert 's The Holocaust A History of the Jews of Europe During the Second World War.He starts the book by showing that hatred of the Jewish people has a long history in Europe . The idea of the Jews as Christ killers has been around for centuries . He quotes some ugly words penned by Martin Luther which certainly fostered a hatred of the Jews . In fact if I did n't know it was Luther who wrote those words I would have assumed it was Hitler . After this first chapter of background information he puts the year at the top of each page so the reader understands the order of events.Every imaginable evil that the mind of a human being can conceive is listed in this book confiscation of wealth herding individuals in trains and depriving them of water and sanitation gassing torturing cruel jokes keeping people in various ghettos killing babies in front of their mothers throwing babies out of hospital windows starvation shootings whippings beatings to name a few . Understandably the entire book is one horrendous story after another . However it also shows some acts of bravery and compassion performed by Jew and Gentile alike.When various camps were liberated the liberators could hardly believe their eyes . Concerning one such camp outside Orhdruf Gilbert says of General Eisenhower that he was so shocked that he at once telephoned Churchill to describe what he had seen and then sent photographs of the dead prisoners to Churchill who circulated them to each member of the British Cabinet . Liberation did not mean the Jews were free of molestation . On the contrary in Poland in 1945 over 350 Jews were killed by Jewhating Poles after the Germans were defeated.Finally here are a few more things I liked about the book . First Martin Gilbert 's writing is easy to follow . He is an excellent writer . Second there is a comprehensive list of sources at the back of the book along with a very good index . Third there are some black and white photos as well as black and white maps in the book . In short if you want to read a comprehensive history of the Holocaust then this book will fulfill that desire . ",4
"The Holocaust A History of the Jews of Europe During the Second World War by prolific historian Martin Gilbert is the most comprehensive one volume work on the Holocaust out there.It begins with describing Hitler 's rise to power and the history of antiSemitism in Europe during the 20th century.It goes on to describe the pogroms against Jews in Germany during the 1930 's and the stripping away of their basic human rights.Gilbert describes Kristallknacht and the destruction of Jewish homes businesses and synagogues.Gilbert describes how during the Holocaust Hungary Italy Bulgaria and German occupied Denmark attempted to protect their Jews from Nazi genocide . No Jews were deported from Italy to death camps until after the fall of Mussolini and the German occupation of northern Italy in the autumn of 1943.The main theme of this book is hundreds of eyewitness accounts of the unbelievable horrors perpetrated against Jewish men women and children by the Nazis and their subordinates during the Second World War which resulted in the destruction of six million Jews including 1 and a half million Jewish children . One is numbed by the sheer horror and bestiality of it all as page after page is filled with graphic inhuman cruelty and bloodshed.Particularly heartrending is the way children were treated by the Nazis.It is from eyewitness accounts that we discover how the SS used to amuse themselves by swinging Jewish children by their legs and then flinging them to their deaths . Another eyewitness Maria HochbergMarianska desribed the fate of Jewish children during the mass deportations in Cracow in March 1943 At Midday cars drove up before the institution . The Gestapo men flung themselves upon the children . Little ones three years of age were flung into baskets and placed on platforms or hoisted on to carts . The older children were driven off to Plac Zgody flanked by armed soldiers . There they joined the grown ups . The baskets with the little ones were emptied behind the city like so much rubbish . There they were thrown into a ditch most of them alive . Some were killed with a blow by a rifle butt before burial.During the liquidation of the Cracow ghetto several hundred small children were shot in the entrance to one of the houses and several hundred old people were killed in the street . So we continue to read of the mass executions and torures and horrors inflicted on the Jews of Europe in these times.We read accounts of Mengele 's horrific experiments on adults and children and of Jews of all ages being thrown into furnaces and of course the mass executions of millions of men women and children in gas chambers and by shooting and then throwing the bodies and halfalive survivors into pitsIt is simply impossible to document how one feels reading page after page these accounts of the scope of inhumane monstrosityAlso disturbing is the section on how after Nazi Germany was defeated hundreds of Jews were slaughtered by antiSemitic Poles and how Soviet soldiers enaged in the rape of Jewish girls who had survived the concentration camps.One of the photos in the photograph panels is a heartbreaking picture of a four year old little Jewish orphan girl shot to death with six other Jews by an antiSemitic Pole just after the war.As well as the six million Jews murdered another ten million noncombatants were killed by the Nazis including a quarter of a million gypsies and millions of Poles Czechs Serbs Russians French Italians and Greeks.Poles Czechs Serbs were to become subject people of the Germans in the New Order but only the Jews were singled out to be destroyed in their entirety . Every single Jewish man women and child was to disappear so that there would be no Jewish life in Europe.Some of the parallels with early Nazi antiSemitism and the new antiSemitism of the 20th century are chilling.For example the boycott of all Jewish shops cafes and businesses in the 1930 's in Germany is echoed by the calls for sanctions and divestment against Israel and for boycotts of Israeli products and businesses by academics farleft politicians and trade unions around the world today.Also the cultural professional and academic boycotts of Jews in Europe then are echoed by the cultural professional and academic boycotts of Israel and Israelis including the banning of Israeli scholars and research today in various universities across the world including North America and Europe.70 years ago the cry of the antiSemites in Europe was 'Jew go to Palestine ! ' . Today the cry of antiSemites YesantiSemites ! around the world is 'JewOut of Palestine ' . The book documents how between 1929 and 1939 with the rise of Nazism in Germany a new wave of 250000 immigrants went to the Land of Israel Palestine the majority of these 174000 arrived in Palestine between 19331936 after which increasing restrictions on immigration by the British made immigration clandestine and illegal.In 1933 in reaction to the arrival of Jewish refugees in Palestine Arab attacks on Jews were launched and continued unabated until 1939.Nazi broadcasts beamed to Palestine Syria and Egypt helped ensure Arab hostility helped ensure that Arab hostility towards the Jewish refugees from Nazism would be kept as high as possible . In response to Arab terror and afraid of alienating Arab support the British blocked hundreds of thousands of Jews attempting to flee Nazi terror to enter Palestine.History has shown that when antiSemitism is allowed to spread beyond the cesspool of the mind that contains it slaughter of innocents and the destruction of entire nations seem inevitably to follow . Today Israel is about the size of the state of New Jersey with a Jewish population of less than 1 % of the world 's population . Yet Iran 's president says the Holocaust is a myth and Israel must be wiped off the map.which would mean the genocide of another 5 million Jews nearly half of the world 's Jewish population . Over half of all Holocaust survivors today live in Israel as do many descendants of Holocaust survivors and it would be a hideous twist of history for these too to perish in the flames of antiJew hatred as they would do if Israel was destroyed by forces of evil God forbid that this should ever be allowed to happen ! And Venezuela 's Stalinist President Hugo Chavez states that descendants of those who crucified Christhave grabbed all the world 's riches for themselves . ",4
"Everyone with any interest in the 20th century soon has to come to grips with the Holocaust . Whether you believe that the SS who murdered civilians were automatons acting under orders or were psychotics or were brainwashed by Nazi ideology one has to come to some conclusion.Martin Gilbert 's book is an inside view of the Holocaust . There is very little theoretical material here but only a narrative history of the genocides . Because he appears to cover as many massacres and shootings as possible it is quite numbing to read this book . At first massacres are relatively sparse though still horrific . As time goes on the Einsatzgruppen step up the tempo until sometimes it seems that every paragraph of the book describes a different massacre . There might be a shooting of ten thousand Jews at a small ghetto in Poland or the extermination of an entire village community in Lithuania or a shipment of Jews from Paris to Auschwitz.The sheer number of massacres is really disturbing and really forces one to consider how anyone could go from massacre to massacre like that every couple of days shooting innocent civilians even children . Surely they can not all have been psychotics ? Many of these killers appear to have had normal backgrounds and certainly did not come from asylums.Read this book with a strong stomach and make your own conclusions on how such a horror could have happened .

"Good read bought it for some history on the holocaust . Very detailed . Very interesting . Will recommend to anyone needing a book on this topic . ",2
"One needs a castiron stomach and maybe something stronger than a glass of wine to get one through this nearly 1000 page study of truelife horror on an inconceivable level.And for a decade Germany was the place that gleefully descended into hell in its quest to murder and torture every Jew it could get its hands on . Infants grandparents teenagers it didnt matter . If they had a drop of Jewish blood they should be exterminatedand they were by the millions.That the Nazi nighmare occurred less than 70 years ago still makes your skin crawl . And as Sir Martin Gilbert points out nearly everyone of the tens of thousands of true human monsters in Germany and Poland never spent a day in prison for their msss murdering orgies and tortures of nearly 10 million Jews . Only a handful of Nazi monsters were given show trials and even those could n't understand the world 's outrage of what they had done.The thousands of killers and torturers merely returned back to their private lives and glibly protested that they never knew of what had happened to the Jews . Why it was so shocking surely they would have heard something ! As the author points out ALL Germans knew exactly what was happening in the death camps and the ghastly massacres out in the countrysides and in plain sight on city and village streets.Description of the many massacres of tens of tousands of Jews can become numbing but it was the separate incidents of Nazi horror that stood out for this reader1 . Many of the younger Death Squad members pleaded with their senior officers to be allowed to specialize in murder of infants . Sometimes these baby killers would discuss far into the night the best and easiest way to slaughter babies and some of them finally came up with a new method . Instead of crushing the babies skulls with the heels of their boots and instead of using bayonets when the child was on the ground it was discovered to be much easier if one killer could toss the infants out of upper windowsand the waiting cohorts could catch the bodies on their bayonets.2 . A second method was to hold the infant by his feet and thenlike a telephone directoryrip him in two.3 . A group of young Jewish scouts were rounded up as they were heading home through a busy village square by one zealous Nazi goon . In a crowded village square he lined the youngster against a wall nnd mowed them down with a riflewith his efforts elicting wild applause from the crowd of German shoppers and passing German school kids.4 . A beautiful young Jewish school girl was hung in the city square by a lone German soldier . Her offense a gust of wind blew a strand of her hair over the Yellow Star she wore and which was noted by the killer . He accused her of deliberately covering up the Yellow Star . As she swung back and forth in the wind dressed in her pretty school clothes her goonlike killer typically cavorted around comically happy to elict laughs and cheers from the delighted passersby.The author proves once and for all that it was n't just a few good Germans who eagerly participated in this national nightmare . Sir Gilbert names priests judges bankers professors farmers tycoons housewives school chldren and espeially farmers . Some of the latter decided to ignore their farms so they could go out and hunt down Jews . These good farmers were expert at ferreting out hidden Jews and eagerly murdered them all especially the children . Forcing them into burning barns was a favorite method . They would celebrate with other mudering cohorts in taverns and Nazi military men would congratulate them while urging them to hund down and kill moremore more ! Descriptions of life in the death camps are even more horrific . In one camp to pass the time some guards came up with a new way to murder . They would stand above the victims in a courtyard and bounce balloons down on the prisoners . Everytime the balloon touched one of the heads a death camp guard would shoot the innocent to great gales of laughter . Some of the guards let their visiting chidren do the honors.After the war most of the worst German monsters managed to escape to other countries often with help from the Vatican . This religious complex actually developed a Nazi secret railway to secretly transfer the Nazi monsters into safer climes . In fact the Vatican was a key element in the United States decision to refuse to prosecute some of the worst offenders because as the Vatican stressed it 's time to move on.The world can move on but history will always record the time in recent history when it really was like a time when Satan visited a country called Germany . The devil must be proud of all the horror that he left in his shadow . ",4
"Martin Gilbert has written an excellent book on the Holocaust.Using testimony from survivorsdiaries of those who perishedGerman documentsand the words of the perpatrators themselvesGilbert exposes for all to seean era of evil.The book is tough to read at times because it is so heartbreaking.The unspeakable crueltythe sadistic actsand the scope of crimes committed by the Nazi regime are laid out in this book.With antisemetism once again on the rise in many parts of the worldthis book should be required reading for all who think unchecked hatred is harmless ",4
"Reading this book is like being buried under a mountain of ashes one shovelful at a time.Gilbert 's strategy is simple and effective . He provides a matteroffact outline of daily events in chronological order beginning in the early 1930s with the rise of the Third Reich and ending in 1946 with the persecution of postwar Jews in Poland . Places numbers and when known key names are provided along with hundreds of quotations from letters and journals . After dozens and dozens of increasingly repulsive and nearlyunbelievable chapters the cumulative effect is simply devastating.It 's impossible to read this book and not view the behavior of modern Israel in a new light.The treatment the Jews of Europe endured under the Nazis and their enablers has cast a shadow over human history that will endure for centuries . As the remaining survivors pass away it is clearly the duty of thoughtful people everywhere to study and contemplate this heartbreaking calamity.I am forever changed by reading this book . ",4
"Martin Gilbert 's the Holocaust is the most comprehinsive and in depth work I have read on this subject and why it gets 5 stars is because of the very personal nature of this book . Mr. Gilbert reverts the numbers back into real people . When reading other books on the Holocaust I found myself being deluged with these massive numbers of atrocities until they began to become abstracted and unreal but Mr. Gilbert 's account is so detailed and filled with personal accounts that every page fills you with a greater sense of the reality and the scope of this tragedy . Instead of a clinical account of numbers this book has personal and eyewitness accounts throughout . He never lets you forget that these were real people with families friends and real lives . This is a gutwrenching read that forces you to look into the darkest reaches of human nature and see just how vicious human biengs can be to one another . A Diary of Anne Frank on a grand scale . ",4
"This is likely to be the standard history of the holocaust . It is meticulously researched and documented.A study of the systematic destruction of European Jewry . A masterpiece chronicling an attempt at modern day genocide.Jews were subjected to horrific inhumane suffering and murder in ghettoes slave labour camps concentration camps and forced marches . Atrocities that were well documented by the Nazi murdermachine.A chilling but essential possession and reference that needs to be read and reread.I have visited many of the sites referred to indeed most of the still remaining concentration camps in Poland.With the alarming increase in antiSemitism now prevalent worldwide especially again in Europe books such as this are crucial indispensable tools that must prevent us from allowing society to follow this path again .

"This is a tourdeforce of history . Martin Gilbert had an ambitious project cover the whole Holocaust from the preHitler days to after the war all over Europe but he was able to accomplish his ends without either glossing over anything or making it too long . I was dizzied by the number of sources he quoted . The guy really knows how to write too and put his sources together into one coherent narrative.Two caveats Gilbert transliterates proper names strangely . For example Tuvia Bielsky is called Tobias Belsky . Also the book was written over 25 years ago and is a little dated as a result a lot of research has been done since then . Has he put out a second edition ? In the meantime Martin Gilbert is my new superhero . ",4
"For those with a self hurting desire to know the whole horrible truth about the bloody act of social engineering known to history as The Holocaust this book is one of the best eye opening and stomach churning works on the subject.Having such a desire this was one of the first books on the subject I purchased and read from beginning to end.It was very painful to read . Every horrible event well described without being graphic or overdone . Better than diet pills for killing one 's appetite . All the horrible things that happened.How did something as this happen ? Read this book and learn . ",4
"I got this book to learn more about the Holocaust and it was recommended by a author of a book which i just finished ",4
"I do n't even know how to begin a review about such a book which in turn is about such a terrifying horror in world History . The Nazi 's Final Solution is one of the very rare first 's in history if I 'm not mistaken there is no precedent to it . Martin Gilbert 's monumental book over 800 painful pages covers the whole history of Jews under Nazi rule from the first segregating laws to the death marches and even beyond the end of the war . I had a book by Gilbert before on the first World War and I was not disappointed to find the same qualities in this book a meticulous work of research and a precision that shows the author 's concern about the exact truth of the matters at hand.Among those things I like with this author is that he shares the floor literally . He constantly give others room by means of quotes and else and thus he carries those voices over to us and that way we get to read the testimonies of direct witnesses and victims of the Holocaust . Because of that the book brings you very close to the events in that it comes directly from the sufferers . I especially appreciate the mix of anecdotes and details from direct witnesses combined with a general narration of the overall situation . You get points of view from different scales you get to know what happened on an individual level and also on the general situation . The author always emphasises on the human level and that is a strong point of this author.On the whole I think this book made me learn about everything I wanted to know on the Shoah as far as the historical basics are concerned but what makes this work stand out is the effectiveness with which it portrays the Holocaust . It is a very difficult book to read because of that it is hard to truly seize the reality of what happened and digest it . There are numerous stories in this book that are horrifyingly shocking . Literally every page is oozing blood . For instance it never occured to me that you could tear a baby apart . Another shocking thing is the treatment of children . You will find out in this book that the most effective way to kill a child while sparing a bullet is to take him or her by the legs and to smash him or her against a wall or the ground . This happened over and over and if my memory does not fail me this method was also used on South Americans by the conquistadores . There are countless such stories gathered in this book and before you get to read it be sure that you can take it . One thing that may help you is that so much of all of what happened seems so unreal that sometimes you just find yourself unable to seize the reality of it and you have to think twice to just truly see what you 're reading.That is another strong point of Gilbert he does not back off before any atrocity . I think the worst things I ever heard of are in this book . From the systematic shootings to the gaschambers every step is exposed and with it are a number of stories told by witnesses those also include Nazis occasionally.I find it difficult to write a review on this book given that it is hard to dissociate the book from the events I mean as far as the book per se is concerned it is a major work . If you want a book about the Holocaust this definitely will be it . This will take you through the Shoah from beginning to end through the ghettos to the gaschambers.Since I do n't know exactly how to structure my poor review and that I do n't make plans beforehand here is a short unexhaustive list of some of the things you will find in the book A detailed exposing of Nazi methods of mass murder most details are usually provided by witnesses except for things they could not know those methods are Shootings . Death or at least injury by bullet followed by burial in large pits often people were not dead after the first shot many were buried alive while others were shot again as SS saw them moving among the heap of corpses . The Gasvans . Those were the ancestors of the gaschambers they were the first means to attempt mass murder more effectively and more economically . Exhaust gas was used first and then they switched to zyklon B . The Gaschambers . The ultimate masskilling machines . People were then buried in similar mass graves as those who died from the shootings this changed when the Nazis realised they would not win the war so in order to erase traces the Nazis began to unearth those corpses and burn them to ashes in crematoriums where all subsequent victims were to be burned to ashes too . The bones were then ground so nothing would remain . The Ghettos were also a means to kill though more subtly since people died mostly of starvation except when Nazis killed Jews randomly or as reprisals for the smallest of offenses . The condition of Jews during WW2 is made very clear by Gilbert . You come to understand that it was n't the Nazis only who wanted Jews to die the surrounding antisemitism is brilliantly put forward by the author and I say brilliantly because it is very painful to read.I stop my list here but there is a lot more that I could mention . In conclusion I would say that this book is likely the standard reference to the history of the Holocaust not that I have any particular knowledge in History but I found this work thorough and painstakingly meticulous . You are given all the numbers dates sources and names you could ask for . However difficult it is to convey the horrors of these events I think Martin Gilbert does the best job one could do.The mass of information given is enormous but you 're never lost the year is printed on top of each page and Gilbert thoroughly follows the chronology of the events in the telling of the Holocaust . Almost day by day you move further into this dark episode of our History . I do n't know what I could say to make this review a little bit better . If you want to learn about the Holocaust and are unafraid of the truth however horrific then I strongly recommend this monument of History . It is a painful read and you wo n't finish it without emotional cost but I believe such a read to be important not only to remember but also to prevent . I know this is the clich & eacute about it but it 's true people were equally incredule of the systemica elimination of a people back then as we are today . Germany was a peak of civilisation back then and it prevented nothing no one not even the very victims could believe it until there could be no doubts left . The constant deception of the Nazis is exposed very well by the author and you can see it and how it works throughout the accounts given to us by witnesses . That is a system I like in Gilbert 's work you have both the view from outside and that from inside and from insiders.A terrible book that should be read by everyone . ",4
"Sometimes you ask yourself about a book is it the author who is so good OR the actual past events that are shocking ! In The Holocaust you will find both . This is a VERY DETAILED book on the fate of the Jews during the second world war the events as they unfolded the dates of extermination the methods of killing the marches the ghettos the numbers massacred.The author uses a lot of eyewitness accounts from all sides and provides excellent facts . The book is MOST UNBIAS it deals also with the early retaliations by Jews which intesified the already exisiting autrocities against Jews that were to follow ! For me it was the first time I came face to face with the detailed HORRORS and AUTROCITIES of the holocaust ! The book is most depressing because it relates one of the most evil periods of humankind when indeed the forces of evil truimphed over matter . I have learned a lot from this book as much as we are different in many aspects we are all humans and mostly we possess that survival SPIRIT which is as hard as iron this is the spirit that kept the Jews going . I am most glad I read this book . Indeed it must be reread for those who have the heart to go through it again . ",4
"The book is over 800 pages and while the research seems through it is a hard read as one experience after another with many similarities described . I found myself skipping parts to get to the meat of the book . Seems very well documented . ",2
"There are no words to describe the Evils written about in this book . But the words Martin Gilbert has do describe with historical precision the destruction of the Jews of Europe by the Nazis and their various allies . The book is difficult and painful to read because of the horrible stories it tells . And as one reviewer on Amazon has said this is a record not of one crime but of thousands of crimes done every day not of one cruelty but of millions of cruelties . One of the features of this historical accounting which may seem to some to disturb the flow of the overall historical narrative but which to me seemed to give tremendous weight and power of the book is the account of individual lives the stories of those people who actually suffered and went through the Shoah . Naming of names in this way and telling the stories of the ' little people ' seems to me to give the account a human strength that more general accounts lack.This work is as I said very difficult to read because of its painful subject matter . Reading it one certainly learns about ' man 's inhumanity to man ' the cruelty Mankind is capable of . One learns to know how certain specific peoples seem to display special tendencies for that cruelty . One learns about the worst chapter in all of Jewish history and of the surviving remnant of it.Who wishes to know and understand the full character of human history must read this book or one like it.Gd help us all . ",4
"Excellent writing historical value touches the soul . Does not read like a compilation of horrible facts but a very personal individual story for people in the Holocaust.Made me question man 's capability for true evil which is beyond understanding here . A timeless massage we dare not forget . ",4
"This book tells the story of those that have been forgotten by so many in history . Gilbert uses a massive amount of primary and secondary sources to tell of the horrific things that happened to the Jews Poles Gypsies etc during World War II and the Holocaust . Again and again Gilbert 's primary sources speak of the horrifying stories of what went on in the ghettos concentration camps and other places . And these sources should know they were witness to these atrocities and miraculously lived to tell about them.This book is a great read . The only reason I give it a 45 is mainly due the poor condition the book came in as it is struggling to stay together as I read through it a second time . I guess I brought this on myself by ordering a used book under the acceptable categoryNEVER AGAIN . Go with good or better on used if you want one that will stay together over time . The other small gripe is that I think the book is a little long at 800 pages and might get repetitive for some readers just wanting an overview of the Holocaustthis book focuses again and again on specific people 's stories . I enjoyed this but after the 187th story of a massacre at a ghetto or in the woods somewhere I began to feel overwhelmed . That said it needs to be told and Gilbert does a fine job at conveying the horrible times of the Jews and others to the reader . Great Book . ",3
"One of the best accounts of the jews of the Europe during the second world war that I have ever read . A intensely distrubing story of the one worst crimes of the 20th century . A must read for anyone interested in the history of last century . ",4
"This is one of those very FEW books that I have actually read more than half a dozen times yes call me crazy ! A good book is difficult to put down but a great book is difficult to not reread ! I have always had an interest in Physics particularly cosmology black holes and the Big Bang theory . This is one of the first books I 've ever read on such topics . Boslough has a way of presenting his material in a concise enjoyable interesting way . This is one of the best sciencephysics books for the layperons I 've ever read ! This is THE book that got me hooked on further and continued readings about physics cosmology the Big Bang quantum theory and so on . Were it not for this book I 'd still be dreading the physics classes I took in college more than 15 years ago ! This book also laid a lot of the foundation work for my research into black holes in preparation for the writing of my science fiction novel Temporal Armageddon . ",4
"I had read Stephen Hawking 's Universe years ago but when it was brought to my attention again recently I decided to reread it something I rarely do . I have to admit it fares well despite the passing of time it was written in the mid80s . This is in part because it is one of the better and simpler introductions to cosmology and the history of the Big Bang Theory . It is also due to the charming personal details woven through the book by its author and relating to Stephen Hawking the man.As most of those who follow cosmology probably already know Stephen Hawking is afflicted with a serious neuromuscular disease . Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS or Lou Gehrig 's disease after the baseball player who died of the disorder had confined Hawking to a wheelchair by the writing of the book and has since put him on a portable ventilator . Having worked with people suffering with this disorder earlier in my career I can attest both to the seriousness of the malady and to my surprise that the gentleman has survived as long as he has . Both facts make his intellectual achievements the dedication of his caretakers and his own personal tenacity for life very real to me and very impressive.John Boslough the author is a scientific journalist . He appears to understand physics at least well enough to describe it for the layperson and does so in a readable style . He also creates a biography that is flattering to the subject without diminishing the contributions of others to the field . The book is however extremely simple more of a history of the development of the theory of the big bang and black holes than a thorough explanation of them and the interested reader would do well to look at Hawking 's own popular writings on the subject for a more thorough and professional point of view . My only complaint about the book would be that it does not contain any form of bibliography a resource I always consider one of a book 's most valuable assets . It helps the reader to find material for further study and it also provides a measure of the preparedness of the author on his topic ! I 'd recommend the book to any beginner who is curious about the Big Bang Theory about black holes the Theory of Relativity the Theory of Quantum Mechanics or about Stephen Hawking . I would also say that any person from junior high level or above would be able to understand the material . ",3
"I 've always be fascinated with Stephen Hawking for everything that he has overcome and for all that he has achieved which would be remarkable in and of itself . While is book a brief history of the universe looks interesting it 's size I feel is a bit daunting . So I thought this would be a good intro book and it was very well written by John Boslough . In such a short book he shows not only many of Stephen 's early work but showed a bit of the man behind the theories including little stories of his sense of humor . ",3
"Stephen Hawking is one of my several intellectual heros . I own all of the books Hawking has authored and probably all of the multimedia he has participated in . I think this one book by Boslough gives an excellent overview of Hawking 's work with no simplification that would mislead the reader . I bought this book to give as a gift . After looking over its content I ordered a second copy for my own library . John Boslough delivers the essence of Hawking 's work . ",4
"This small book originally written in 1984 was and is still revealing.Firstly on a personal level Hawking admitted already at that time that As far as theoretical physics are concerned I 'm already quite far over the hill'.Secondly it gives an excellent explanation of Hawking 's contribution to theoretical physics black holes and their similarities to the beginning of time.Thirdly Hawking has outspoken opinions about the anthropic principle against the universe of Eastern mysticism an illusion the many universes theory not meaningful or determinism 'Even if we do achieve a complete unified theory we shall not be able to make detailed predictions in any but the simplest situations'.This booklet offers also excellent examples for the theories of relativity and quantum mechanics and contains Hawking 's Inaugural Lecture 'Is the End in Sight for Theoretical Physics ? 'Although this book is from a theoretical point of view out of date no superstrings it should not be missed . ",4
"In this presentday world it seems impossible that there could someone who has not heard of Stephen Hawking even if it is only from his appearances on Star Trek The Next Generation or the Simpsons . And yet within this frail tiny man lies one of the most potent minds mankind has ever borne forth yet I am given to wonder if he would have achieved his current level of notoriety if he was not crippled by ALS . Or if his powerful mind would be less so were it not trapped within the body of an invalid . I can not answer these questions but instead I read mainstream publications and like so many others stand in awe at the feet of a man who carries Einstein 's legacy further toward a final answer . A unified field theory.It started ten of fifteen billion years ago during the Big Bang that explosion that had blown out all of the matter in the universe . The Big Bang did n't simply occur in the void of space it created space as well . But what Hawking is looking for partially is knowledge as to whether the fundamental forces of physics existed or not within the first few billionths of a second after the explosion or whether or not time existed either . Hawking and others in his field like Roger Penrose are trying to find a correlation between cosmology and quantum mechanics which is the study of the internal workings of atoms and the movement of subatomic particles . Indeed it is a journey through spacetime and one that if found will teach us a little more about the universe.From the dust of stars we came and to the stars we return . Much like A Brief History of Time we are given truly intimate glimpses into the intricacies of both the universe and Hawking himself . He is a man with a great sense of humor coupled with an almost childlike enthusiasm for new things . His bet over the origins of Cygnus X1 with physicist Kip Thorne certainly bears this out If it turns out that the binary system does not contain a black hole breaking many a physicist 's hear Hawking will win a fouryear subscription to the British humor magazine Private Eye . If it is a Black Hole Thorne will win a oneyear subscription to Penthouse . In effect Hawking bet against himself since he believes that one of the objects is in fact a black hole.Indeed no other object of stellar phenomena has so captured the public 's imagination and superstition than the prospect of a black hole . These oncemassive stars of 10 to 15 solar masses that have collapsed down to mere fractions of their previous size and emit fields of intense gravitation . And those that get so smallto the point of a singularity may yet reveal more information on the origins of the universe since Hawking theorizes that what was before the Big Bang may indeed be imitated by what is within a black hole . As with so many things others have asked why is it so important ? And like Sir Edmund Hillary replied when asked why he wished to climb Mount Everest Because it is there.What is also remarkable is that ALS usually kills individuals much sooner and by all rights Hawking should have died years ago . But somehow he keeps going he turned 59 in January and perhaps it is that drive to explore with his mind if not his body that keeps him going . But I for one am very grateful that Mr. Hawking is still with us because the world needs great explorers . ",4
"How does one become an elder of the tribe ? A first at Cambridge is a long way toward making one an elder.Being abused for discovering a fact like evaporating black holes also seems to help . Where there is a limit to eldering Hawking reached it in 1980 when he said the end of science was in sight . In my own cosmology research I have found indications of seven layers of selfsimilar quantum uncertainty based on odd powers of the velocity of light . Hawking 's limited physics is based on only two of these layers . In terms of observation we have only Levy jumpstructure in distributions of galaxy clusters dark matter and the observation by Dr. Parker of a very small particle in supernova spectra to indicate that these unknown theoretical layers actually exist.Like terrorism which kills it 's own best and brightest a doctrine of limits on science is self defeating and probably wrong philosophically as well . An elder of the tribe can be mistaken and so mislead others.We appear as a tribe to be at a plateau of learning but not at an end to it . ",3
"I consider Cronin 's biography of Napoleon to be the best ever written on the great man . It is detailed without being boring . The amount of research is astounding . This is the first book to buy for any study of Napoleon . You may want to check out the books by J. David Markham also . ",4
"Several reviewers have cited Mr. Cronin 's readability which is definitely a plus for this volume . However I did n't find his tone as neutral as did others . It seemed a virtual panegyric of Napoleon when compared with Frank McLynn 's dispassionate tome . I found Mr. Cronin 's willingness to buy into much of Napoleonic apocrypha offputting . Impressive in its personal tone it 's obvious Mr. Cronin is interested & approves of the subject however I prefer a bit of objectivity to my history as far as that is possible . ",1
"Napoleon is reported to have said this and it is true . In this magnificent biography of the Corsican Cronin has written the life of Napoleon from the inside who the man really was . It is not only circunscribed to battles and politics but especially the intimate life and anecdotes of Napoleon . It changed my vision about this man . The information and research are exhaustive yet the book reads like a novel . That is the true art of biography.Napoleon has been one of the most controversial characters in History and deservedly so . Cronin does not take sides but he clearly rejects the portrait of Napoleon as an overambitious monster always trying to get more and more territories for France . Undoubtedly ambition was the driving force for this man but we have to consider that he was constantly harassed by other powers who feared that his influence would destroy the old European regimes . Undoubtedly his coronation as Emperor was a big disappointment to all those who believed he would be the leader of Republicanism . Beethoven for instance dedicated his Third Symphony to him but after the coronation he erased the dedicatory writing instead To the memory of a great man . However we have to judge historical figures by the standards of their times not ours.All in all this is probably the best biography of Napoleon . At least it is the best among the three or four I have read . It is a shame that it is out of print . ",4
"I was taking a threeweek course on Napoleon 's life so was using this as a reference along with some others . I think the book is very dated especially based on more recent facts . Book itself was in good condition and arrived promptly . ",2
"Simply put Vincent Cronin 's Napoleon is the best biography of Napoleon I have ever read . As a student of Napoleonic history I have read many biographies of the great man but none has struck home like this one . Cronin presents Napoleon as the man he was not the myth not the legend not the AntiChrist . Napoleon 's fascinating life from birth to death reads like a novel . It is hard to put down.Unlike other authors Cronin does not appear to take sides . He presents Napoleon 's accomplishments as well as his faults . If you were to chose one biography of Napoleon this should be the one ! ",4
"I got this book at a second hand stall in Thailand because there was nothing better there all romances etc . and I was unable to put it down ! It 's fascinating and the characters are so vibrant and real that you can almost smell them . There is a lot of talk in the introduction about how Napolean is treated as a villain in England and how this book runs counter to that . I have never been exposed to that bias so it did n't affect me . What was interesting though was how Napolean 's early success set him up for his later spectacular defeats . The book covers the events from Napolean 's birth to his death and even if you end up not entirely in sympathy with his actions during his life you still can maintain sympathy for him as a person and for France at that crazy time in its history . The best thing about this book though is its readability . You can swap it for some popular adventureromancelight reading novel and actually learn something without your brain hurting at all . ",4
"This is an excellent biography of Napoleon . It is written in such a way that you feel as if you 're reading a novel rather than a dry biography this a good thing as it makes it exceptionally easy to read . It does n't really look at Napoleons more negative attributes but does show how innovative and what a great leader he was . An engaging and enjoyable read.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page . ",4
"This book reads very smoothly . For me it was a revelation on the life of a truly great man . The intrigue and parrying between Napoleon his loves and his adversaries seems more amazing than any novel you could read or movie you could see . It IS a long book . Nevertheless it is divided into manageable chapters that allow you to take a breather here and then . ",4
"It was n't too long ago that it could be said that the sun never sets on the British Empire . Much of the credit for this truism goes to The English East India Companya huge commercial enterprise that grew from a small group of Elizabethan tradesmen into the grandest society of merchants in all history . The expansion and colonization that made England great was for the most part due to the efforts of that Honourable Company.It is to John Keay 's credit that he is able to tell the story of the early beginnings and subsequent growth of the this group of merchants and administrators in such a lively and anecdotal manner while keeping strictly to historical accuracy.Whether you are a writer of historical fiction or an avid history buff this is a great addition to your library .

"I was interested in learning about the UK 's earliest travels to India and beyond and this book certainly was informative . I thought the author went into an overly exhaustive explanation of some things and he seemed to revisit certain periods over and over but all in all it was interesting and I 'm glad I bought the book . If you 're looking for more of a brief overview of this era this is not the book for you . ",2
"Has faithfully labouredto bring alive this remarkable enterprise with colours flying.Be warned Keay crams his story with extensive quotes from the archives and that in italics so bring a magnifying glassand be prepared to do a little rereading . My copy refers to a paperback.The hardcover may be kinder to the eye.This book assumes you are familiar with Indian geography.As such to me who does not the book simply goes begging for accompanying topographic mapsand I would advise anyone considering giving it a read to get some .

"The East India Company which described itself as the Grandest Society of Merchants in the Universe controlled half the world 's trade at its height . This grand book obviously the subject of many years of research often reads more like an adventure yarn than a book about a business even the grandest in the universe . The Company which received its Royal Charter on the last day of 1600 moved through a series of fits and starts disasters and triumphs as it moved through a turbulent 220 years of history . From its initial fumbling start on the obscure nutmeg island of Run it eventually turned into a quasigovernment ruling vast parts of India and the most important enterprise in the China trade . It outlasted absolute monarchy in Britain and saw the rise of the modern corporation.John Keay has done a masterful job of telling this story but look at the material he has had to work with ! The Honourable Company often seems to have been pretty dishonourable characterized by ferocious infighting both in the headquarters in London and overseas . The characters who set up trading operations in farflung corners of the world appear to have been either indolent drunks or superhumans burning with ambition . There are enough pirates and battles and exotic names to please any reader . And the leitmotiv of British salesmen anxiously trying to unload tweed cloth to unidentifiable buyers in the tropics.The East India Company although a monopoly had competition . It came from many sources including the Dutch the French and particularly from interlopers traders working on their own account . The Company also had to compete with its own employees who paid a pittance conducted business on their own accounts as well . The strength of this book is that it gives the impression of boundless activity even when things went badly . Given the different locations the company operated in and different local conditions it is remarkable that the narrative flows as smoothly as it does.The writing is often superb . No Imperial apologist Mr. Keay often makes the point that historians have tended to look to the Company as a harbinger almost the organizing idea for the British Empire . This foreshadowing is strained . The Company men to judge from those described in the book were motivated primarily by greed and selfinterest . Some such as Warren Hastings who became GovernorGeneral in India and held the position for thirteen years were genuinely fond of India . Hastings is a fascinating character and Keay 's writing does him and his colleagues honourThe Great Moghul as Hastings was called in Calcutta 's first newspaper stood alone a sad and selfrighteous Caesar embattled but unbowed solicitous but ruthless fastidious but careless lofty yet deviousa man in short crying out to be misunderstood . Contemporaries duly obliged so has posterity.With this kind of writing I must recommend this book highly . Just have a bookmark available because it is necessary to keep flipping back and forth to the maps . Just where is Benkulen anyway ? ",4
"It seemed to lack the human motivations . Not much on the Opium War too much on India and not enough on China . ",2
"From the author of the impressive _India A History_ comes this compact but consistently informative study of the English East India Company from its origins in the last days of the sixteenth century to the first decades of the nineteenth . This is narrative history at its best packed with detail incident and striking characters . Keay fills his pages with entertaining curios and arresting anecdotes ensuring that the human elements are never lost amid the sweep of history . The geographical and historical sweep is broad and the focus does not remain unwaveringly upon the Company 's servants but takes in details of societies ranging from London to Japan.For the student of the period there is enough sharp analysis here to provide a useful overviewintroduction to the issues of the period . For the general reader there 's a wonderful tale encompassing everything from early modern finance to a harem in Sumatra . Wonderful . ",4
"Recording 200+ years of East India Company history is no small feat for in such a work this farflung commercial enterprise produces a litany of ships ports merchandise employees currencies costs indigenous rulers company directors parliamentarians military men privateers and scalawags . That John Keay kept it straight is admirable . That the reader can is even more so.The Honourable Company is a witty insightful and at times painstakingly detailed account of the East India Company 's cyclical expansion retraction retrenchment and reexpansion over the course of three centuries . From the island of St. Helena to Canton China Keay patiently plots the monopoly 's course . Ever eager to highlight the irony inanity and ignominy characteristic of such an enterprise Keay provides several humorous asides in addition to those moments when the reader ca n't but shake his head at these haughty illinformed greedy and grasping monopolists.Wellresearched wellwritten and a delight to consume The Honourable Company suffers only when the blander details of global trade begin to inhibit it 's otherwise excellent pace . The sheer volume of material required to catalog an endeavor of this magnitude makes it difficult to entice the reader page after page . Yet John Keay pulls it off smartly and for this The Honourable Company merits a rating of 4+ stars . ",3
"The book is an excellent introduction to the partition of India . It appears biased as Lord Mountbatten is a primary source and receives little criticism . The book is easy to read and has many brief personal stories to provide a sense of what the events were like for those participating suffering in the events . I did not give it five stars because I felt that there was not enough critical review of the actions by both British and India leaders that lead to horrible suffering by hundreds of thousands of people . ",3
"Lapierre writes this as if it were a novel . I found it was a real pageturner and also educational . It is the story of what happened after India won its independence from Great Britain and decided to divide into India for the Hindus and Pakistan for the Muslims . It is hairraising . Gandhi played a major role . Learning more about him was very interesting . It is a bit too long but well worth reading . ",4
"This is an excellent book about nations states people ethnic and religious tensions and violence versus nonviolence . Anyone seeking not only to understand modern India but indeed the post modern post colonial world must read this long and detailed book.The insights reflect the over three years of research and incredible access that the authors had to both primary sources and participants in the process of dissolving Britain 's Indian Empire.The book starts with a violent prequel to Britain 's decision to leave India . Two events collidedBritain the exhausted and spent ` victor ' of World War II could no longer afford the Empire and India may of its men having fought and died for liberty elsewhere in the Commonwealth wanted their own domestic freedom . Events tensions and bloodshed started to spiral out of control until Churchill was forced to admit It is with deep grief that I watch the clattering down of the British Empire with all of its glories and services that it has rendered to mankind . Many have defended Britain against her foes but none can defend her against herself . p. 53 The challenge for the British Indian and would be Pakistani leaders and planners was to fix a date and a process that would not be perfect but would somehow be better than Gandhi 's incantation to leave India to God.Mountbatten and Jinnahthe lead Brit and lead Pakistaniheld a series of meetings that were crucial to the carving up of Empire . At the same time Mountbatten had to deal with Nehru and Gandhi on the other side of the equationa prequel to ` shuttle diplomacy ' if ever there was one . Despite the fact the most prudent planers wanted no partition Jinnahsecretly being consumed by a tuberculosis he knew would kill him soondrove himself and everyone else to achieve the dream of a independent and separate Pakistan . Knowing that you will not long live to inherit the consequences provides a freedom of thought and action that is liberating in the present but holds dire results for the later generations . pp 102111While everyone was trying not to let the emotions and dogs run loose and wild more and more ethnic and religious incited violence continued to leave hundred and indeed thousands of dead in wide swaths across India Kahuta Peshawar Punjab Kashmir . Seeking to calm the tempers and stay the killings instead the British were left with almost no choice but to draw an almost arbitrary set of map lines that guaranteed the violence would accelerate before it would abate . Mountbatten traveled tirelessly his perceptive wife at his side from refugee camps to destroyed towns and burnt bodiesand ever more frantically realized that he had to set a date soon and then drive everyone remorselessly to achieve it as perfect as it could be not as perfect as it should be.Ironically it was the ArmiesPakistani Indian and Britishthat had to be brought back into to instill discipline and restore some semblance of order although in many cases they were simply too few too late . As the Chapter 13 our people have gone mad ' displays in poignant writing once the lid was off the pot it simply began to boil over even faster . Gandhi in the last great act of his life before being assassinated by a Hindu group of radicals was able to instill some peace and orderbut only in the isolated spots were he could personally be present . As the multitude of 20 30 and 50 mile long columns of refugees wound their way past each other the unspeakable was done over and over again . Trains were halted and all butchered . The scope was simply too vast even for Mountbatten and Gandhi.In many ways this book foretells of Africa the Balkans and Iraq today in a great many painful parallels . It is a hard read but read it you must if you want to try to understand how groups that have lived more or less at peace and in coexistence can over a few short months and years become bitterly polarized antagonists for generations to come .

"I 'll keep this short its a fascinating historical story and is worth telling and worth reading . But it 's simply too long of a book . And somewhat repetitive . I 'm well aware that India is a very populous countryno need to hammer it into my head continuously . Otherwise I found myself interested but had a hard time getting through it by the end . ",2
"The crown of the British Empire was always India yet ruling it was a very complex task due to the enormous number of different religious and ethnic groups . When it became clear after the end of the Second World War that Britain would be forced to grant independence to her Indian colony Lord Mountbatten was appointed to the post of the final British Viceroy to the colony . Once the British flag was lowered for the last time at midnight hence the title it was up to the people of India to govern themselves a task that seemed impossible at the time.This book is the best account of a short yet climactic event of history that I have ever read . It is spellbinding to read this account of how the entire subcontinent seemed to degenerate into anarchy . I recently watched the remake of War of the Worlds where the train signal goes off and the burning train moves through the town . Something similar actually happened in India during the transition to independence and selfgovernment . Trains would pull up to stations and blood would be dripping from the passenger cars all of the people on board had been killed by rampaging members of other groups . Even the Indian military fractured on ethnic and religious lines Hindu units massacred Muslims and Muslim units massacred Hindus . The only reliable military units that the government had were the Ghurka units where they existed they provided the only reliable protection for the people.There have been other instances where a society suddenly collapses into ethnic and religious hatreds with a slaughter of one or both groups taking place . Recently we have seen it again in Bosnia and Rwanda . However nobody has ever captured these events in such detail and clarity as Collins and Lapierre have it is one of the hardest books to put down that I have ever read . It should be required reading in any course dealing with the history of the British Empire India or even the twentieth century . ",4
"i picked up this book cuz i was curious about the event of the end of the British Raj . in countless other books this subject came up over and over . now i see why . it is not only about the breakup of England 's control over India and the formation of Pakistan and India . the interplay of events personalities religion politics the intense discrimination between Indians themselves all had a part to play in the awful way things played out . it is very very easy to say religion caused everything that went wrong or that England totally screwed up the separation when they knew better but these authors make sure we see the big picture . this book does not describe a morality play of conquerors vs. natives or the good religion vs. the bad ones . the book really describes all too human motives and fallabilities that in this case caused India 's woes but it could have happened wherever humans live and create societies that rub up against each other . ",4
"This is a detailed and well informed description of the events and the people that brought forth the independence of the great country that is India . It is a story of perseverance during difficult times and there is much in it of the life of Gandhi and his love for his country and its people.It is a story of a great mind a great soul diplomacy and humanity.I highly recommend this classic .

"I grew up in India being taught in schools about the godlike characteristics of leaders like Nehru . But this book offers a very thought provoking viewpoint on the people who played the major roles in the historic drama that ended the British Raj . This book is coauthored by an American and a French and it is definitely a result of a lot of research . It is written as a fiction rather than a historic documentary . The authors have gone to great lengths in describing each character and scene in great depth.There are still some limitations that I see about this book . This book was published in 1975 . The only major character alive when the authors were doing research for the book was Lord Mountbatten and he is the one they have extensively interviewed . I suspect the authors might have been unintentionally or otherwise influenced by a lot of Mountbatten 's views . Mountbatten has been portrayed as the perfect human being who became the saviour of India . Gandhi whom Mountbatten apparently held in high regards is portrayed as a saint . And Jinnah whom Mountbatten evidently disliked is a villain of sort This book was banned in Pakistan because of that . I am not disputing these views . They sound accurate from what we know about these people now . But I am just wondering if the authors had gotten an opportunity to interview Jinnah at length provided the cold Jinnah would have opened up would the story look different ? But since this is not written as a documentary but as a fiction I guess the authors have the freedom to wander a bit . Because of the same reason I would recommend against treating this book as a historical guide . I have heard many people arguing about Indian independence basing their argument on what they read in this book . I am not sure if this book is reliable enough to form opinions based on.And one word for the overpatriotic Indians who would argue that this book is biased and who keep blaming the British for everything Jalian Wal Bagh is their favorite topic this book 's story focuses on India 's independence from British not India 's occupation by British . The story begins in beginning of 1947 when Mountbatten was assigned to be India 's last viceroy and ends at the death of Gandhi in Jan 1948 . The story of occupation is another story . For a few days unremember everything you learned in school and read this from a neutral point of view . For average reader who would n't have the patience to dwell into history books this is as neutral as it can be . The more historyoriented folks should read some real history books . ",4
"Beautifully written meticulously researched history of the tumultuous times surrounding Indian independence . I was not very familiar with this time in history or this region and the authors did an excellent job of providing all the background and previous history necessary to to understand the events described in the book . Highly recommended for history buffs or anybody interested in understanding this area of the world a little better . I look forward to exploring other titles by these authors . ",4
"I would recommend this book to someone who has only a limited knowledge of the history of the British Indian Empire and the subsequent partition which created the modern nations of India Pakistan and Bangladesh . The book gives an overview of the history of the British Raj and the subsequent partition but lacks balance . As other reviewers have pointed out the book tends to idealize Gandhi although it does point out how many of his followers ended up distancing themselves from him due to his various personal quirks and bizarre utopian economic and industrial schemes as well as Nehru and the Congress Party and on the other hand demonizes Jinnah and the Muslim League . This book repeats the claim that the demand from Jinnah for partition was only a personal crusade of his and had people known he was dying of lung disease they would have waited for him to leave the scene and other more moderate Muslim leaders would have stepped forward and agreed to remain in a united India . Another book I have read End of Empire points out that in a conference held after the end of World War II Jinnah agreed to accept loosely federated united Indian state but the Congress party rejected the proposal so it is incorrect to say the the blame for partition is solely Jinnah 's . Jinnah was a totally unreligious Muslim who was an early member of the Congress party and believed in HinduMuslim cooperation but he opposed Gandhi 's religiouslybased civil disobedience campaign fearing correctly that it would lead to violence and sectarianism . In the provinicial governments set up after the Indian elections held in 1937 the Congress party often refused to share power with Muslims in provinces where Hindus were the majority . This led Jinnah to the conclusion that Indian must be partitioned a policy he opposed when it was first proposed in the early 1930 's . In any event the rise of Muslim conciousness around the world in the postWar era and its increasing rejection of secular politcs would have almost certainly lead to turmoil in the heavily Muslim parts of a united India as we see happening in Kashmir.Similarly the hypocrisy of Gandhi and Nehru are glossed over in the book . Gandhi who demanded from his people that they make sacrifices in order to push the British out of India turns around and tells the Jews who were being murdered by the Nazis and the Ethiopians being invaded by the Italians to passively accept their fate . Gandhi had the good fortune to confront the basically civilized and democratic British but he had no antidote to genocidal Fascism . Similarly Nehru who preached passive resistance to the British had no problem sending the Indian Army into Portuguesecontrolled Goa when he saw that Gandhi 's way was not working fast enough.Still fairness requires stating that when all is said and done when we compare modern India with the other giant nations China and Russia India with all its flaws has more or less remained a democracy and did not end up carrying out mass terror against its population as the other two did so this speaks well for the country that Gandhi inspired and Nehru lead for so many years . This book gives the reader much of the background needed to understand this . ",2

"Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre have managed to capture one of the most important years 1947 of world history in their book . Freedom at Midnight is possibly one of the most outrageously enthralling works of writing based on real events that I have ever read.This book is an account of the year 1947 in context to the freedom of India from the British Raj . It opens on New Year 's Day 1947 London and takes the reader on a journey of significant events that lead to the independence of India . On the way the reader is introduced to many brilliant characters who shaped up the history in that part of the world and have since left their mark that is still evident . The decisions made by these people defined the future of millions of people.Freedom at Midnight is an intimate account of the reasoning of these historical figures that lead to the independence and division of India . Why did Prime Minister Clement Atlee who took office dedicated to break the Empire apart choose Louis Mountbatten a member of the royal family to be the last viceroy of India ? Why was he the man to administer India 's freedom operation ? This book is one of the most intimate accounts of the most venerated figures in the world 's history Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi aka Mahatma Gandhi . His approach position attitude towards the British Raj the Indian Congress the political and social blueprint that he dreamed of the Independent India . And viceversa . As the book flows like an epic it gives detailed account of final days of Gandhi and who why and how of the assassination of this revered leader . The reader is also introduced to Jawaharlal Nehru Sardar Patel and Mohammad Ali Jinnah.What happened to the Maharajas the palaces the tigers the jewels and the harems ? What lead to the demise of fantastic royalty in India ? The authors have devoted a whole chapter to recounting the opulence enjoyed by the Maharajas and their magnificent indulgences.How was the line drawn that divided the nation ? Who initiated the idea and why was the idea initiated ? Collins and Lapierre show poignant picture of the greatest migration in history . The religious division left an estimated 250000500000 people dead.One of the unsolved matter since than that still afflicts both nations India and Pakistan and have since lead to three wars Kashmir is devoted a whole chapter . The valley that was once described as heaven on earth by the last Mogul Emperor of India today is contradicting the emperor 's statement in every way possible . This book discloses the history behind the conflict.One of the most appealing qualities in the writing of the authors was their effort into giving some personal accounts into the lives of the common people . I recommend this book to anyone who is a student of world history and precisely history of India . This book takes the reader through the year that lead to the birth of three nations India Pakistan and Bangladesh . ",4
"One for the most amazing books on the independence of Pakistan and India . This gives all the intriguing details of the main characters . Tragic uplifting . A GREAT read ! ",4
"I am not an expert on the subcontinent and I found this book to be well written and gripping . It ties together events occurring at nearly the same time so the reader gets a feeling for the huge tragedy that overtook India . I had read Paul Scott 's The Raj Quartet and Staying On which are fictional accounts of the Partition . This book filled in many of the historical details that serve as backdrop for the Scott novels . I like that this book does not glamourize the English Raj many of whom were clerks elevated to masters in the British India . It does seem more negative toward Jinnah and the Muslims than the Hindus but I do not yet know whether this is a fair depiction . The Sikhs come off very badly . It succeeds in inspiring the reader to seek out more facts about India and Pakistan . ",4
"I read this book a decade or so ago but it has been coming back to my mind recently apparently simply because it made such an impact and I now have a medium Amazon in which to express my appreciation of it . It is an impressive book in every way an epic story with gripping narrative about extraordinary events and characters . I had had no conception of the monstrous tragedy of the partition of India from Pakistan . This book not only describes its true dimensions but also makes clear how circumstances can force such absurd things to occur . Much of the book is a biography of Gandhi and here I could only marvel at the power and authority of this man and on top of everything else be riveted by the assassination story in all its detail that I had not known about . Whether there are more accurate accounts of these matters I am not in a position to say . I can only report that I found this book completely satisfying in multiple respects as history as biography as narrative . At least for a nonexpert I ca n't imagine how it could disappoint as a book however distressing and alas also timely its subject matter may be . ",4
"I enjoyed this book . Freedom at Midnight is about the transition of India from a British Colony to an independent nation on midnight of 15 August 1947 . I learned about the history and background of that event however the stongest attribute of this book is the description of the characters and personalities involved . The key players are Mountbatten Ghandi Nehru and Jinnah . I developed a high regard and respect for Ghandi and his work . I did not feel that the authors presented one viewpoint at the expense of others . If there is a fault with this splendid book it is in its overreliance on Mountbatten . Even that is minor and forgiveable . What does come through is how the lives of the people at an individual level were and are still affected by this historic political change . If you are interested in the history of India this book will be interesting to you . ",3
"This is a great read for those interested in the history of the Third World . India and Pakistan are countries with huge populations and their independence in 1947 was one of turning points in the decolonization of the Third World . Collins and Lapierre detail this story in this book . Also detailed are the four people most important in the independence Montbatten Gandhi Nehru and Jinnah . Millions may have lost their life in the Punjab but it would have been a far bloodier story if these people were not around . Focus is given on Gandhi who was a most unselfish person in recognizing the rights of all faiths . The book details how Gandhi 's struggles lead to the independence of India and how the leaders of the different faiths broke the country up into Pakistan and India . The last part of the book is the story of the assassination of Gandhi by Hindu fanatics.This is a great read . At a little over 500 pages this book will take some time to digest but it is one of the best books about the independence struggle of Pakistan and India . This book also sheds some light on the current problems with Kashmir.A great read . ",4
"A strange book which projects a bit player in Indian history as a great Hero . The authors gushingly portray Mountbatten as a great man who 's superior negotiating skills charm and decisiveness found a solution to the Indian 'problem ' when the reality was Jinnah 's obstinacy won the day and rivers of blood flowed postImdependence . Considering most of it is based on stuff recounted by Mountbatten himself this book shows up Mountbatten as a braggart . If you can ignore this aspect the book makes for a racy interesting read which is unusual for a book which purports to be history . Read it as a historical romance the Mountbatten stuff cum tragedy and you will not be disappointed . ",2
"This is just an amazing read in the same tradition as O Jerusalem written by these same two authors . Very engaging and makes you feel like you were right there .

"The book starts at Jan 1947 and covers the period till early 1948 . Somehow I missed history of Indian freedom . Even though I had it during my schooling . I was too young to be interested in dry history books.This book is for anyone who is interested in Indian freedom . Probably the best book I have ever read on Indian freedom.Written by two persons neither British nor Indian this book gives an outsiders view.The books main protagonists are Mount Batten and Gandhi . The pages about Gandhi are extremely well written . Utmost care has been taken to each sentence uttered by Gandhi . Passages about Gandhi are so good that those pages give the pace of a page turner.Two things I had missed are Mount batten and Nathuram Godse . Lot of information on both these subjects you will find in the book . Mount battens personal life and Godse 's plot to kill Gandhi has been written in detail.I got interested in Indian freedom only after seeing movie GANDHI . The screen play writer of this movie was clearly influenced by Freedom at Midnight.Opening scene where Gandhi is thrown out the train is from the book . Movie Gandhi concentrates solely on Gandhi and some how less focused on other freedom fighters.What I liked in the book This book does n't have the dry pages of a history book . There is a good pace This book gives a 360 degree view of Indian freedom . Not only the freedom but also the British and Mount Battens are well covered . The details about the Maharaja 's are very niceWhat I would have loved to have in this book is Information on rest of the freedom fighters . The book speaks only about Gandhi Nehru and Patel . I would have loved to read about Shubash Chandra Bose shashtri etc . More on GandhiNehru family . No importance has been given to their wives and children . Since the book starts from Jan 47 earlier days of Gandhi and the things which lead to become a Mahatma are missing.Einstein once said thatGenerations to come will find it difficult to believe that a man such as Gandhi ever walked the face of this earth.There is a justification for this in the book . I am amazed by Gandhi 's simple ideas like salt march quit India non cooperation etc . worked so well on those days . But also some of his ideas like nonindustrialization after freedom and non violence solutions for the Sikhs when they were getting killed in Punjab are utopian.I am surprised by Gandhi 's experiments to test his oath of Brahmcharya . Clearly I had missed this.Over all I feel that this one is a great book . Any one who is interested in Indian freedom history should read this book . I Also suggest CITY OF JOY from the same authors . ",3
"As an Indian American I figured it was about time I learned some of the basics of India 's struggle for independence and the partitioning of the country . Freedom at Midnight describes the 1947 through early 1948 time period when a couple decades of revolutionary efforts by Gandhi et al finally resulted in Britain 's decision to leave India . Alas the parting was n't as quick and easy as hoped for . While the struggle for independence had unified the Hindus and Moslems of India to some extent when it was won their ancient animosity for each other led to tensions that caused the leaders to partition the country and later erupted into some of the most appalling and senseless slaughter of the century.Although the book begins with a few flashbacks into the backgrounds of the major characters the focus is on 1947 . So you wo n't learn more than the essential history of Gandhi 's peaceful revolution or details of the growing distrust between the Hindu and Moslem segments of the population that the British in the 1940s were barely able to keep from exploding into bloodshed . What you will get is a very wellwritten and moving account of India 's final viceroyalty under Lord Mountbatten the fall of the maharajas the helplessness of Nehru and Patel in the chaos of late 1947 the agony of the Punjab during the mass migrations between the two countries Gandhi 's assassination and a few other topics . From the acknowledgments and chapter notes at the end of the book it 's evident that the subject matter was thoroughly researched mostly from primary sources . Certainly many of the conversations and descriptions must be fictional but the general historical accuracy of the material is highly credible.Freedom at Midnight is a long book considering the relatively short time period covered . Weighing in at around 520 pages not including the ending notes I feel that it was a bit much . About 250 pages would have been adequate for solid and wellwritten coverage of the material . The authors chose to add a lot of color to the story as in dramatization . Lord Mountbatten is certainly made out to be a superman who can do it all . We are treated to indepth coverage of the maharajas ' excesses . Probably too much is made of Gandhi 's Spartan habits . Numerous case studies of unfortunate Hindus and Moslems caught in the bloodshed are interesting but largely unnecessary to the account . Finally the plot against Gandhi 's life is very interesting but again told in more detail with more drama than was strictly necessary for enjoyable yet informative reading . I 'll say this though it never gets boring.Overall recommended to all readers who enjoy history but do n't a mind a bit of drama added into the mix ! Make sure you get a copy that has photographic plates in it the photos are wellselected and augment the story well . ",3
"i read this book when i was 18 as part of supplementary reading for my high school special paper on contemporary indian history i am not indian and studied indian history purely as personal interest . unlike my indian history text books Freedom at Midnight was easy to read and so much more interesting . The writers adopted a story telling style such that readers can appreciate the story without the academic jargon . even if you have no interest in history i highly recommend this book as the story is engaging and complex.on a sidebar . i found it so sad that india pakistan and bangladesh were all one country all brothers and sisters . however as events unfolded india and pakistan became sworn enemies as if two blood brothers became strangers focused on annihilating the other . even as a non indian non pakistan i feel the sadness . i hope these two peoples would eventually find the reconciliation to become friends if not brotherssisters again..

"I can only say that this book is really splendid . It is like all history books should be it describes historical events and portrays the personality of the persons that played a role in it but it also concentrates on the common people that lived in that time on their dreams on their beliefsAnd this last part is surely what makes of this book a great book the fascinating diversity of the indian religions the manifold of colours and scents of India are depicted vividly.And also very vivid are the personalities who appear in this book the little ones as good as the big ones.For example the figure of Gandhi is depicted in all his greatness and spiritual authority but also the strange parts of his character are shown . The same for Nehru or for Mountbatten . And in this way all the meetings of this persons become like the scenes in a thrilling novel.If you read this book you 'll learn to love India like I do ! ",4
"I was required to read this book in high school world history . I have since read it several more times and hope one day to visit Pakistan and India . It is a true story most Westerns do not know anything about . Awesome and brilliantly written ! ! ",4
"Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre also wroteO JerusalemandIs Paris Burning.They note that once while Gandhi and his wife were making love a rap on the door interrupted their lovemaking . It was a servant . Gandhi 's father he announced had just died . Gandhi was horrified . He was devoted to his father . Moments before he had been by the bed on which his father lay dying As a result of this trauma teh joy of sex began to fade for Gandhi . An indelible stamp had been left on his psyche . Pg . 50They also record Gandhi believed in nature cures and he also believed administering medicine by hypodermic needle contravened his dogma of nonviolence Aware that his wife was dying from acute bronchitis the British flew a supply of rare and precious penicillin to the prison . But at the last minute when Gandhi learned that the drug which could have saved his dying wife would have to be administered intravenously he had refused her doctors permission to give it to her . After her death Gandhi 's own death failed rapidly . Pg . 73They observe As his confidence in his mastery of his desires came back he gradually extended the range of physical contact that he allowed himself with women . He nursed them when they were ill and he allowed them to nurse him He had his daily massage virtually naked with young girls frequently serving as his masseuses the naked state represented the true innocence for which he was striving In the twilight of his life Gandhi was a lonely man . He had lost his wife and closest friend in a wartime prison . Pg . 8081Of his famous fast to stop HinduMuslim violence they note No spectacle could better justify the suffering that Mahatma Gandhi endured during his fast than the one awaiting him around QuwwatulIslam Even he however could not have imagined a success as complete as the one that his fast had achieved . Hindus and Sikhs who a fortnight before would have welcomed Moslems to Mehrauli with daggers and kirpans stood at the entrance to the mosque decorating the arriving pilgrims wiht garlands Gandhi was moved almost to tears . As the ultimate expression of their gratitude the mosque 's leaders invited Gandhi to address the faithful from the heart of their shrine . Pg . 489490They add in conclusion Not a few of Gandhi 's ideas which once appeared an old man 's quirks have become almost three decades after his death strangely relevant in a world of dwindling resources and expanding poopulations . Cutting up old envelopes to make notepads rather then wasting paper consuming only the food necessary to nourish one 's frame eschewing the heedless production of unneeded goods began to appear by the seventies not so much as a set of charming eccentricities as perhaps a prescription for man 's uncertain future on his exhausted planet . Pg . 533This is an unflinching insightful biography of Gandhi 's role in the liberation of India and will be of great interest to anyone studying Gandhi and Indian history . ",4
"Collins and Lapierre are among the most overrated historical writers of all time . The writing of Freedom at Midnight is good and the text is interesting and in my opinion they would do quite well writing fiction . One would think given the pages and pages of references at the back that this is a thoroughly researched book but this is a good instance of how statistics can lie.Here are some of the big errors I found in the book1 . The biggest whopper is that Messrs. Godse and Sawarkar enjoyed a homosexual relationship . Nobody who knows even an iota of the facts from any other sources will believe this all I could do was shake my head and smile at this preposterous claim which incidentally does not even provide a reference.2 . The life of the maharajas chapter all lies . The reference for this whole chapter is a book written by an Englishman who wanted to impress people back home . It is akin to claiming a Wild West account as fact.3 . There is no RSSS . The organization is RSS Swayamsevak is one word . This just smacks of poor research . I doubt the writers have even looked at the covers of some of the books they have claimed as references.4 . Many place and people names are badly misspelled . There is no Pavel in Bombay for instance . The place name is Parel and it is not a high income locality . In fact it has a huge factory workers ' colony.I found several more and am sure still many more exist in the book I am just a typical Indian no historian or anything like that . Although this book is very interesting I wish I had not read it and would not recommend it to anyone who wants genuine knowledge about India . Whatever I knew of the book 's subject is now mixed up with the book 's lies so I do n't even know what is true or not anymore . Surely false information is worse than no information at all . ",2
"History has never been so intriguing . Being an Indian I read the book from an Indian standpoint and for me it was an incredible experience . Having grown up in India I have been exposed to a lot of material about Independence but none have aroused such thought as Freedom at Midnight . A masterfully written superbly researched and above all a very human account of what happenned in that period of Indian History . Mountbatten comes across as the hero of India and though Gandhi is shown to be more human than saint his actions were definitely that of a Mahatma . This book gave me a better understanding of my own country . A must read for every Indian or anyone who is interested in India . ",3
"I found this book captivating . Since I work with more than 20 Indians and one Pakistani I was able to discuss the events in the book at length with them . One of my friends ' father barely escaped death on one of the trains fleeing Pakistan . He and his brother have bullet wounds to show . The Pakistani 's father also narrowly escaped death while leaving India for Pakistan . Two of the Indians decided to read the book with me . All agree that the book is accurate . It was very emotional for me to read of the atrocities and understand the personalities involved . My Indian friends experienced even more intense emotion as the read of the experiences of their parents.One of the other customer reviews stated that the book made Montbatten look too good . My Indian friends disagree . Montbatten was a great man . The book might have underrated him if anything.The book also shows several sides of Gandi that most Westerners are not exposed to . He is still a great soul though.This book will change you . At least read the first 100 pages before you make a decision it 'll draw you in . ",4
"This book is about the struggle for freedom in the modern Indian subcontinent and its consequences . India largely attained its freedom through satyagraha . The entire subcontinent opted for struggle for freedom through peaceful demonstrations while at the same time the rest of the world was killing each other with newly invented bombstankers and planes.Ofcourse the subcontinent paid a premium price for the peaceful struggle . What motivated these people towards this experiment ? What happened to these people ? To their leader ? What troubles did they face ? How did the dynamics of a revolted society of billion people so mind numbingly divergent play ? The authors did a brilliant job of reconstructing the precursors the movement and the consequences . The British thier attitude the Indians their philosophy the Maharajas the comman man religion religious heads politicians and the blood thirsty all play their role.Here is the synopsis The last viceroy to India was sent on a mission to finally end the British rule in the Indian subcontinent . The British wanted it to be done as painlessly as possible even if it means dividing the land before leaving it . India then and now was a supremely complex society . British managed it by 'divide and rule ' practice . Meanwhile a small brown naked phakir named 'Gandhi ' started uniting the voice of India through simple and peaceful methods.Salt satyagraha is one of them . Gandhi managed to lead the struggle for the freedom into a national movement . Finally when India was getting its freedom muslims demanded for a seperate country for themselves called 'Pakistan ' . The muslim movement became a parallel movement and boiled down to two nations . This set the stage for partition . The hindus who have been living in the would be Pakistan had to migrate to India . Also the muslims who have been living in the would be India who opted to leave to Pakistan started migrating . This is the largest human migration in the history . A drama that is very disturbing emerged out of this.This book is the about the story of these people . There are numorous sub plots or mini stories in this book that are testimonials to the human nature and will stand the test of time . ",4
"The cover blurb intrigued me Big city attorney Bartholomew Crane goes to tiny Murdoch to defend a murder suspect . But something is awry in smalltown Canada and weirdness abounds.What the cover blurb does n't mention is Barth brought some demons to Murdoch with him including a nasty cocaine habit and terminal ennui.Andrew Pyper gives us a fine view into Barth 's disintegrating personality and his increasing obsession with the town legend . Some very nice atmospheric touches I could see the trees and feel the cold smell the dank of Barth 's moldering hotel room.The Canadian locale seemed exotic to this American and the unfamiliar setting made the plot a little more creepy.A good story wellwritten . Recommended . ",2
"Lost Girls by Andrew Pyper is set in aforgotten dirty and desolate Canadian towncalled Murdoch not too far from Toronto . Thebook is abouteverything human I can think of . Anarrative recorded by a coke addicted lawyerBartholomew Crane who is sent by his firm tothis town to defend a school teacher accused ofmurdering two girls though the bodies have notbeen found . The town is as gritty and numb toitself as Crane is to himself and the world aroundhim . Crane who has a need to hide from a veryreal and melancholy innocence where the eye ofthe tiger of lives for him as well as many of theother characters . The novel the writer 's first isabout so many things so many layers that itdenies any juggling act of specificity . Though it isvery specific in what it does it would be likepinning down a snow storm . Impossible . Justobserve at first from the outside . Then step insideand be engulfed in its beauty . It is darklyartistically intelligently written in a kind ofpoetry that is purely Pyper 's own.To make Crane likable from the verybeginning even though he is cynical as hell andseemingly so smart and savvy and untouchedmuch as we in other words does n't care abouttruth uses dishonesty when it suits him much aswe in other words and does n't give much of adamn particularly about those little girls whomight still be alive is the mark of a writer whosees into sadness and comes up somehow withdiamonds . Crane is acerbic and funny as well . Heis a marvelous observer . There is somethingmirrored of him in the accused killer ThomTripp and in the legend of the Lady of the Lakewhich is a childhood horror that grows likeserpents out of that dark body of water and hasin one respect to do with not where Crane'sinnocence stopped but added new accidentaldimension to itself.The book is bleak but invigorating . Ifthere are the fabric threads connecting all of thistogetherThom 's pictures of girls from teenmagazines papering his apartment wallsfor thatway they can not leave if Crane has to hate allpeople because it is like making them and himselfvanish to guard against casual cruelty if thecruel killing of a war refugee from Poland in thatmurky lake that is like the dark center of theworld in this place from which she calls forretribution and made into a legend to disguisereality if Thom persuades two girls into a dreamworldd that they so love till it starts being realand maybe still they love it evenIt 's best not to become what one wishesbecause it may be at odds with the lies ofnormalcy that make lives fit into tight carefullydrawn straight lines of roads in thewildernessthen the pattern conceivably is aboutinnocence . And what a malign raw wound it is.What monsters hide just beneath the skin not tohurt as much as to keep from hurting . Still thoughthere is this relentless return to what causes toomuch anguish to even contemplate . To coverinnocence with horror because even that is easierto take than the pure blast of its source . There isthe need to deny while pursuing so doggedly thesolvings . But though Crane burns many pages ofhis father 's books in the lake house Crane neverknew existed he is powerless to resist the sirencall.Innocence the book says can includemany dark deadly thingsCrane 's deepmelancholy love for Caroline and her fate .

It is Tripp'sdesperate attempt to get back to his own boyhoodsuch a close fit he hopes between the school boyone day and school teacher the next that surely hecould make the jump back . As well as to a happymarriage . And to his daughter . The bookabsolutely pulses with energy and by the way isquite terrifying . It is incredibly believable andheart rending . It is also about redpmption tocome out of the coke haze . To say goodbye andrush upward to the surface of that dark lake.The light that comes is grim butilluminating . It works like a great deep terrifyingultimately refreshing dream that takes the ruinedthreads stitching them together . It names theweavers of the tapestry are . In unexpectedrevelations .

"The opening chapters promised much from the genuinely chilling prologue to the delightful introduction of Barth Crane the junior associate of the far from reputable lawyers known cynically as Lie and Get 'em off.My anticipation grew as Crane arrives at the vaguely unsettling location of Murdoch and meets some bizarre and well depicted characters . But then by about a third of the way through I found this book really began to drag . What revelations there were felt decidedly underwhelming . The supernatural subplot was very understated almost as if it could be put down to Crane 's sleep deprevation and drugs abuse . Whilst this ambiguity could have been a major advantage if handled subtly in Pyper 's hands however it merely comes over as a rather wishywashy loss of direction . The courtroom scenes are adequately if uninspiringly described and the twist if indeed it were intended as such is eminently guessable and left me feeling rather unfulfilled.Lost Girls falls uncomfortably between two stools . It probably has insufficient gritty authenticity to satisfy readers of legal dramas and whodunnits and certainly contains not enough shocks and chills for devotees of the ghosthorror genre.I 'm sorry I can not be more generous about Lost Girls . The author clearly has considerable talent and often employs startling and delightful imagery but the overall impact of the novel on me was rather akin to a wet grey mush which perhaps was Pyper 's intention ? . ",1
"This is not a good book . Simply because its not well written was a least 100 pages too long for the story contained no characters about which anyone could be reasonably sympathetic and had no focus.Part courtroom drama part ghost story the plot of Lost Girls never really finds a focus . It shifts from a murder trial in which the main character is the defense attorney to ghost story to urban legend . The main character himself is sleazy unlikable and incompetent and I gave up on finding anything redeeming about him after the first 50 pages . That said its difficult to care what happens to him . The lady in the lake legend is an element that never pans out for Pyper and should n't have made it past the editor . It merely adds static to an already precarious plot.Overall its obvious that this was a first novel and it makes a good case for the use of editors . Sentence fragments and passive voice abound . If the story itself was better it would be easier to forgive these things but alas its not.Leave it sitting on the shelf . There are better things to read out there . ",0
"Slip into the murky depths of a town with dark secrets . Secrets no one seems to want to talk about and secrets most would completely deny the exixtence ofthat is until two of the town 's favorite daughters go missing . In the ensuing uproar over their disappearance a battle cry erupts from one of the girls ' fathera wealthy and influential member of the town . His vengeance is aimed squarely at the head of Thomas Tripp former local English teacher and recent confidant of the two Lost Girls.The resulting search of Tripp 's apartment and his recent past reveal a defeated haunted man with secrets of his own . The walls of his modest teachers apartment are heavily adorned with thousands of cutout pictures of young girls in various stages of undressgleaned from teen girl magazines and catalogues . Muddy clothing found in his clothes hamper and a bloodstained rear seat in his car seem to point to his unequivocal guilt . The fact that he recently experienced a painful divorce and subsequent loss of visitation rights to his only daughter because of very questionable behaviour only increase the appearance of his involvment . Tripp is arrested and held in the disappearance of the two girls.Enter Bartholomew Christian Crane a still wetbehindtheears young attorney from a neighboring cityand newest member of Lie Gettemoff and Associates a nottooprestigious law firm known for defending some of the country 's more despicable criminals . Crane accompanied by the diparaging comments of the senior partners of the firm and a cocaine addiction larger than his rented Lincoln Continental appears reluctantly in the town of Murdoch where the story takes place . He is fully prepared to do whatever it takes to procure Tripp 's freedomeven withhold evidence . What Crane does n't realize is that he 's headed directly into the nightmare of his own pastlong repressed and thought forgotten . As the insidious secrets that hide in the town of Murdoch slowly seep into him Crane begins to realize that those very secrets are his secrets as well . As he loses control of the case and his own mind we witness the inevitable destruction of two men a town and the results of what secrets can do to the very fabric of life.Ghosts come in many forms . Andrew Pyper creates a disturbing ominous and wholly memorable ghost story in Lost Girls . Painting this dark mystery as a bleak landscape of selfdestruction and courtroom drama he draws an eerie portrait of man 's vastly troubled soul using faulted human canvasses . His depiction of a town and its people caught in the undertow of the past is incredibly vivid and nightmarish at the same time . This is one book you wo n't soon forget . ",3
"LOST GIRLS begins with a prologue describing cousins in a canoe having sex . The canoe overturns and the girl is pulled into the depths apparently by some monster.The next chapter is rather confusing because suddenly there are two girls missing and their teacher is a suspect . We are introduced to the protagonist attorney Bartholomew Christian Crane . Crane works for Lyle Gederov & Associate often referred to as Lie Get ` Em Off & Associate . It will be Crane 's job to defend the teacher . Graham Lyle is according to Crane a raving queen . Gederov is a secondgeneration Russian immigrant who has somehow retained a threatening hint of his ancestor 's accent . He 's also cruel misogynistic racist flatulent and nauseating dining company . The key word here is misogynistic . So now we have incest and misogyny and a partner who 's homosexual Crane is sent to his home town of Murdock Ontario . Crane 's client does n't seem to care if Crane gets him off or not . Crane does n't care all he wants to do is win but as he begins to piece together a case blaming someone else of course the bizarre legend of the place begins to pull him down . There 's a story about the Lady of the Lake and suddenly the prologue begins to make sense.If you assume the book is going to be about how Crane gets the teacher off you 'll be wrong . Crane begins a search for the Lady of the Lake apparently an actual person who fits in well with the misogynistic elements at the beginning.Too much of a downer for you ? Surprise surprise . Get ready for an O'Henry twist at the end that cloaks Crane with redemption . ",3
"Bart Crane is a criminal defense attorney with moral values equvialent to the average serial killer . Cocaine addicted and having an unseemly attraction to teenage girls this character is the embodiment of a thousand lawyer jokes . He is sent to a burnt out little town in Northern Ontario to defend a man accused of killing two teenage girls . Then the atmosphere grows eerie as the bad dreams and hallucinations begin.This novel owes as much to Dicken 's ' A Christmas Carol ' as it does to the works of Stephen King . The lead character at first seems to be an antihero but by the novels end the reader believes he has transformed into a halfway decent human being.I would recommend this horror legal thriller hybird to fans of John Grisham Stephen King or Ruth Rendell.Also Recommmended 'Julian 's House ' by Judith Hawkes and 'Something Dangerous ' by Patrick Redmond ",3
"Barth Crane is a high powered Toronto attorney who relishes the rush he receives when he wins a case . Ethics are not a problem as Barth will do anything to triumph including lying under oath cheating and tampering with witnesses.The tightly focused lawyer travels to Murdoch Ontario on his first murder case . Local high school teacher Thomas Tripp is accused of killing two students . Barth expects an easy victory because the bodies of the victims were never recovered nor are there any witnesses that Tripp committed a crime . Circumstantial evidence links the suspect to the murder . The barrister settles in at the local hotel and begins to immerse himself in the life of the town in an effort to gain an edge for his client . Gradually the legend of the Lady in the Lake begins to haunt him changing him and making him take actions that will effect Barth for the rest of his life.LOST GIRLS is an atmospheric work that seems gothic in tone . The story line gradually builds up the tension level until the reader feels like Barth overwhelmed and anxious . Barth is a loathsome person yet the audience will feel drawn to him especially as he travels down a road nobody could have foreseen he would take . Andrew Pyper 's ability to bring his story to life is brilliant and will leave readers clamoring for more works as soon as possible . Do n't be surprised if this book hits the charts.Harriet Klausner ",4
"I am on the fence about this one . It was a good read and the writing was not bad . That said it was not as terrifying or compelling as the blurbs stated . Of course that is a matter of opinion and we all know what they say about opinions . As you can see from my other reviews I read a lot of horror and I may just be immune to the subtler forms of suspense and thrillers . ",2
"I totally enjoyed the wit and sarcasm that Bartholomew Crane displayed throughout the book . The characters of Graham and Bert were unique and well drawn . The plot was a good one with shades of Stephen King throughout . The descriptions of northern Ontario and the people that inhabit it were very good reading . Over all I really liked this book however I had to give this one a three star due to the length of the book . I felt as though the story line had become redundant . The reader should probably wait for the paperback on this one in order to make it worth while . ",2
"Ashley and Krystal were best friends and one day never returned home . Both teenagers they disappear in a small town by a lake in Ontario Canada . One of their school teachers Thomas Tripp is accused of murdering them after some evidence turns up . However no bodies are found . Defence lawyer Bartholomew Crane is summoned for the court case and reaches the small town from Toronto assuming this to be quite a straight forward case an easywin . However his client Tripp is very uncooperative and seemingly unstable and this combined with an old ghost story surrounding the lake a story known in fact by all the locals and with his own personal problems to deal with make him realise that the case is much more complicated than what it appeared in the beginning . The impact of what Crane learns as the days go by trying to put all the pieces of the puzzle together is quite strong . He starts having nightmares and being haunted by visions.And the question keeps lingering where are the girls ? Why have n't their bodies turned up yet ? In my opinion this book is well written but lacks in connection with character development meaning that a part from Crane who is the leading figure and is accurately described in all of his feelings and circumstances the other characters fade into the background too lightly despite bearing relevance to the story and deserving more space . Suspense is quite high in parts but in the long run and because it is almost always connected with Crane it becomes a bit trite . While it is true that I have never liked ` ghost stories ' much this is not exactly one of them or not entirely . This fact alone may have made me depreciate the book a bit but I still feel that a certain jenesequoi should have been added or changed to make the story more compelling . As it stands it is a bit too implausible and that includes its end . ",2
"It seems that this gorgeous book has been marketed totally incorrectly . The cover makes it look like a cheesy thriller so people who want a fast mindless read pick it up and get bogged down by the psychological depth mythical dimension and gothic aesthetic . Andrew Pyper 's book is a portayal of the darkness within a man 's soul and man 's connection between darkness and feminity both holding fascination as well as horror . It is about the female aspect of a man 's psyche coming up to haunt him because it was repressed for too long taking on the form of ghosts teenage girls and strippers . It is about females in society also and the way they are percieved and treated by the males who desire and fear them . Women represent certain psychological aspects of men and in the book they take on mythical archetypal roles . The symbolism of the lake around which the book revolves of evil lurking beneath the surface of the water is another representation of the murky dark psychological depths of man which also correlates to women 's sexuality . The main character is impotent and obsessed with young girls and has a boyhood secret he has never been able to get over or deal with . The town he goes to in order to defend a man accused of killing two teenage girls also has a dark secret in its past the townsmen got together and purposefully drowned a woodsdwelling prostitute they all had slept with because they became afraid of and disgusted by her . It is a very timeless theme of literature and Andrew Pyper has a fresh eerie take on it . Please do not underestimate this book and do not read it if you want a formulaic whodunit type thriller . Whodunit is not remotely the point in this book . ",4
"I glanced through the pages of this book in a supermarket about nine years ago and instantly was hooked had to buy it . I never do that . I never read books from the shelves of the supermarket first of all because I admit it I 'm a literary snob . But this one I could n't put down . I could n't put it down from the moment I picked it up . I had to read it late into the wee hours of the morning and even though I was terrified to turn every page I had to see what happened next and got more and more terrified . I remember at one point thinking I have to put this down and stop thinking about it or I 'll be too afraid to sleep.It meanders through the mind of a madman and it becomes more and more obvious that the detective must be the killer . I love the vagueness of it the fact that you 're never quite sure . I do n't mind that you are left wondering if what you think happened is what really happened . I do n't mind at all it left me thinking and wondering and haunted . I loved this book and was very sad to see that it is no longer in print . ",4
"I first read The Demonologist fron Pyper and LOVED IT ! ! So I bought The Guardians and Lost Girls with high expectations . I first read The Guardians and really enjoyed that as well . So I had high expectation for Lost Girls . I struggled to finish the book . Just a let down after reading Pyper 's other two books . The main character 's personality was a turn off . I did n't like the flow of the story . I just found the storyline slow . I might have had a different opinion had I read this book BEFORE the other two . I just expected more . ",0
"I actually read THE KILLING CIRLCE before unearthing Pyper 's first book . I loved this suspense novel because it 's so different . As a writer I admire anyone who breaks out of the cookiecutter mold and has the courage to fashion their own style . Mr. Crane is a protagonist worthy of the best literary detectives in the tradition of Sherlock Holmes onward . ",3
"I 'm a bit disappointed in the other reader reviews I 've seen here . After all this is a FIRST novel by the author and I was amazed by the great writing in so much of this book leaving me with a desire to read more books by Mr. Pyper who I expect to get better and better as time goes on . To be honest this book has some of the flaws of a first book written by an author who needs more practice tightening and sharpening his sense of pacing and drama but even so there is much to recommend here . The first chapter where a young girl is dragged to the bottom of a lake by an inexplicable force is truly gripping . After that first chapter there was some lack of tension here and there and things dragged a bit at time but I still could NOT put this book down . There is an original voice at work here one that deserves to be heard again and I for one am looking forward to reading another of this author 's books in the future . ",3
"There 's an interesting premise a potentially fascinating set of characters and a grisly set of deaths all based in an atmospheric town . It should have been a good read . And it almost was . ButThe atmosphere and foreshadowing overwhelm the characters and the story . The tension and the mood is laid in so heavyhanded a manner that it 's distracting . It became a chore to plow through this novel to make it to the end though I did for whatever reason . The few 'mysteries ' were incredibly predictable . The descriptions were so dense that it was tough to remember what happening in the story and the caricaturization was so distracting that it was impossible to care at all for the characters . ",1
"This book has a borderline personality . Nothing about it is full blown . The herothe settingthe plot and the secondary characters are all vaguely creepy.Suggestions of the existence of Evil are hinted at but there is no proof of anything save for life 's pitiful relentlessness and its ability to drown you under unless you can outlast outwitoutdo or simply bow out . The writing is wonderfulbut dont expect any easy or neat answers . Read it on a hot and humid day and then think a long time before you go in for a swim . ",3
"I enjoyed this book in the beginning but then grew increasingly weary of it as it went along . This book was not overlylong pagewise but it felt that way to me . As a matter of fact towards the end of the book I actually started skimming which is something that I never do.The main character was extremely unlikeable and I did n't like him any better after he betrayed his client by giving locks of the dead girls ' hair to the old woman for her to turn into the police . Sorry I am a lawyer and have no tolerance for such things . I am not a criminal lawyer and never could be because I would n't want to defend people I believed to be guilty . But once undertaking their representation however I would not betray them as it is professionally unethical.I also had no feeling whatsoever for the accused killer . He did n't inspire fear or loathing or sympathy or much of anything . I kept waiting for something to happen with his character and nothing ever did.The author 's style reminded me a little bit of Nelson DeMille . That is the somewhatunsympathetic main male character with a sarcastic sense of humor . But I have enjoyed DeMille 's works far more than this.I do n't recommend this book and I doubt I will read this author 's works again . ",2
"I found this book to be fairly uninteresting . It was a very quick read but I figured out who was whom early on and then just found it to be rather dull to get through the book . ",1
"This is a wonderful thriller . The plot is unique and the dialogue and characterization scintillating and witty ! American writers with the exception of Anne Lamott and Tom Robbins bore me I generally stick with the English ones . Pyper from Canada is in the latter arena . Lots to think about in this one but more importantly lots of laughs too . Read it ! ",4
"Whenever I read mysteries I never read the dustjacket of the hardcover or back of the paperback because it ruins the plot for me . I like to be surprised . The beginning of the book would have been ruined if I had read the jacket so thank goodness I did n't . This is an entertaining mystery novel set in Canada . It has murder a trial and a gothic ending . My fave mystery writer is Laurie King but this was a refreshing change of pace . I do n't want to give anything away but if you want a good mystery in a gothicinspired setting this book is for you . ",2
"But that is not to say there is nothing good about this book . The epilogue was simply brilliant and unfortunately the story line got worse from then on . I bought a book being told that I was going to be reading a courtroom thrillerdrama with elements of the supernatural . To a small extent this is true however Lost Girls is far more about the main character 's cocaine addiction than a supernatural tale . Written in the first person but in an intensely irritating passive tense I walk across the street . Rain splashes on my face and so on Lost Girls actually becomes very slow reading the more you go on . Compared with the excellent epilogue this is a let down indeed.The rest of the time that Crane is not discussing whether to have one line of snow or two we are treated to the other characters in the book . Most are so stereotypically bland as to be of no interest at all . Thomas Tripp the accused is by far and away the most cardinal of character sinners as Pyper tries desperately to portray a horrific fiend of mental imbalance when the effect is somewhat nearer to a sad old man who has simply had enough . Then there is McConnell the filibustering parent of one of the missing girls and Crane 's associates Pyper 's caricatures rather than characterisation of one excessively camp gay man and one excessively large unpleasant and rude man . I doubt very much if Pyper has met the like of either.So in total we are talking about a book initially brilliant which overplods to a totally unsatisfactory ending which takes far far too many pages to get to . And that does not even touch on the disappointment of the central supernatural legend that comes straight out of the Blair Witch Project.No . My only advice is do not waste your money and your time .

"I 've just finished reading this book and after reading some of the reviews I have to say that this book does n't get the credit that it deserves . At first the book was a little confusing . Not in the storyline but in the way the author wrote . But this confusion quickly disappeared very early into the book and afterwards the story was thoroughly enjoyable . The way the author portrays the main character in the story is fascinating ! It 's like he slowly breaks down as the book progresses . And the ending is not one that you would expect . All in all I think this book is an interesting look into the world of law from a lawyers point of view as well as a look into how a crime takes over a small town . Ignore the bad reviews and just give this book a chance ! It ca n't hurt . ",3

"Incorporating the best of Scott Turow and Stephen King Andrew Pyper has created an unusual and compulsively readable novel in LOST GIRLS . Attorney Batholomew Crane is a young coke addicted attorney assigned his first murder case . It 's Barth 's job to get a teacher accused of killing two of his female students off . No matter what the cost Barth intends to get his client an acquittal . As Crane digs deeper into the case pieces of which may be tied to the town 's history and to a long forgotten shameful episode in his own past Barth spirals further and further away from reality . With prose so beautiful it brings to life the desperation of Bartholomew Crane as he slowly suffers a personal breakdown and redemption and the cold white desolation of Northern Canada LOST GIRLS has a creepy atmosphere that compels you to keep turning pages . ",3
"Lost Girls exists at a curious intersection of genres a Scott Turow courtroom drama twisted about a Martin Amis comic amorality play a Stephen King ghost story messing with a Thomas Harris psycho thriller . This conjunction of story types is mostly compelling to Pyper 's credit there are few moments where the disparate elements collide rather than collude.Despite the solid sense of place Canada certainly an underutilized thriller locale and dank gothic atmosphere the ghost story elements are the least effective and I 'm a big fan of ghosts popping up in genres where the do n't belong because its awfully tough to credit Pyper 's amoral cokefiend stripclubbing protagonist having such a freakout at a few odds and ends going bump in the night and because the book has to decelerate its cocainedriven prose and pacing to to whip up the requisite dark and stormy lake atmosphere.So after an appallingly funny kick off the book drags a bit in the middle stay with it . The story takes an obvious twist I did n't see coming and stays particular and curious all the way to the end . The only caveat for genreonly readers despite the thriller drag Pyper 's concerns are more those of Turow & amp Amis than King & amp Harris is a plus for everyone else . ",3
"Imagine Stephen King but with subtletyOkay I ca n't imagine that either . A better comparison is Donna Tartt 's cult novel The Secret History . In both cases I found the book by accident never having heard of the author became entirely immersed from Page One and felt a sense of loss when it ended like finishing the last morsel of a favorite dessert . Pyper 's Lost Girls is eerie witty richly atmospheric and keenly suspenseful though the suspense is less a result of wondering whodunnit or whatdunnit ! than it is an eagerness to see how the answers will effect the book 's protagonist . And what a protagonist . Pyper 's antihero narrator is a proudly immoral selfabsorbed lawyer whose determination to free a likely murderer is exceeded only by his concern that he might run out of cocaine . Entirely against your will you find yourself feeling empathy for the guy and yearning for his redemption . A fabulously diverting book . ",4
"I picked up a copy of Andrew Pyper 's LOST GIRLS at a yard sale for the unbelievably low price of a dollar . The book jacket was covered with praise and accolades for Pyper 's tale of murder and madness in northern Ontario and I faintly remembered there being some buzz on the literary scene following its publication a few years ago . But I have had some bad experiences with book jacket blurbs as of late and was cautious.So steeled against disappointment I plunged ahead and was fortunate to discover that my dollar had not gone to waste . LOST GIRLS is a dark and moody thriller a compulsive pageturner of high caliber . But for a novel that presents itself as more of a John Grishamtype foray into shallowlydrawn characters and legal machinations LOST GIRLS is almost the opposite a heavily characterdriven story that has far more to do with acceptance of one 's own past actions than it does the courtroom . LOST GIRLS is less a legal suspense story than it is a ghost story where buried secrets threaten to overcome those unable to reconcile the past and the present.LOST GIRLS follows the first murder case of Bartholomew Crane a criminal defense attorney with few qualms about what needs to be done to successfully defend his clients . He is summoned up to the remote northern Ontario town of Murdoch where Thom Tripp has been charged with the murder of two young girls . The drawback is there are no bodies with which to confirm the murders and anything that points to his client as a killer is circumstantial at best . But despite this clearly winnable situation Crane slowly finds himself doubting his reasons for wanting to defend Tripp . Local superstition points towards the involvement of an angry spirit in the lake and Crane begins to have sightings of things he can not easily explain away.Pyper has set himself a daunting task to perform and has only added to the pressure by manufacturing his antagonist as an extremely unlikable character . Crane is an impotent cocainesnorting mess of a man a man not above outright lying in the pursuit of winning a case . Any moral qualms he may have about what his clients have done pales in comparison to his almost fanatical devotion to winning . But Pyper is careful not to judge his character very often in criminal defence work a moral qualm can only get in the way of providing the best possible defence as required by law . Pyper understands this dichotomy and it may be one of the reasons a reader might be displeased with the novel . It is much easier to get behind a crusading warrior for good than a determined lawyer who understands that everyone is entitled to be thought innocent until proven guilty . That is the law and the way our society functions . Pyper appreciates the stress this can put on a person and acknowledges that sometimes the job can be arduous.Pyper 's strength in creating a story comes from his refusal to take the easy way out . Instead of cheapening the plot by having a more crowdpleasing conclusion i.e . evil lawyer recognizes the serious vocational error he has made and travels back from the dark side Pyper gives us an inner journey of selfdiscovery . What Crane slowly evolves into has nothing to do with a laypersons onesided view of morality and the law and everything to do with atoning for the sins and regrets of past exploits.Pyper 's addition of a ghost story to the mix is one of his only missteps . While it does much to establish an atmosphere of dread it never seems fully resolved . Crane 's frequent forays to the lakeside become increasingly bizarre and loaded with coincidence . It serves to fuel the plot but it 's incomplete unfocused . And Crane and Tripp 's final meeting is presented in such a way as to drain any tension from the story . It 's an ending but it feels rushed . And Crane 's legal superiors Lyle and Gederov are caricatures of the worst sort onedimensional criminal lawyers who represent the most basic stereotype of the immoral lawyer . They allow Crane to see what he may become but they do n't belong in the same story and do disservice to Pyper 's obvious talents.But minor quibbles aside LOST GIRLS is a fine unpredictable thriller . And in that small subgenre of novels set in northern Ontario this surely must rank as one of the best . ",3
"Pyper has a way with a narrator . He is as capable of writing sarcastic oneliners as he is drawing an evocative picture of a person or place . I enjoyed this book and he 's an author I 'll look for again . ",3
"I enjoyed the creepiness of it and must admit there were times I actually felt my heart pounding a bitand I was jumpy around the house for a little whilebut it still ca n't be classified as horror it is n't really satisfying as a mystery it 's more than just a story . I guess for me it just left a whole lot to be desired.The main characters were very onedimensional . In fact ALL of the characters were onedimensional and needed a lot of development.I ca n't say I 'd never read another Pyper book again but I can say I 'm not rushing out to see if there are any more . ",1
"Having lived in smalltown Ontario cottage country for 15 years of my life Pyper 's depiction of Murdoch is bangon particularly the hotel where he spends most of his time from his description of the bar right down to the telephone ringing in the middle of the night . As he rightly puts it every Ontario town has a Queen 's Hotel or an Arlington . His accurate descriptiveness aside Pyper 's interaction with his two law partners is sidesplitting in its own right and as such it is easy to see where our Bartholomew comes by his cynical attitudes towards both his profession his clients and practically everyone else he comes in contact with.The plot sometimes stretches but on balance is a fine mystery and more than deserves the awards it has won in Canada . If I 'm not mistaken it 's the authors first novel . A brilliant start . ",4
"I 'm not sure what to make of this book . The juxtaposition of the northern Ontario locals and the summer folk rings true enough but all in a vacuous ethereal setting and tone . Is it Erle Stanley Gardner ? Stephen King ? Mary Higgins Clark ? Dashiell Hammett ? Hunter S. Thompson ? It 's all that and less . I hate it when reviewers divulge plots and I wo n't burden you with it here.I 'm going back to the more solid meat and potatoes or is that corned beef & amp cabbage of Father Greeley 's Chicago . ",1
"Sorry folks did n't find any OHenry ending at the close of this book . In fact not quite sure what the ending is . I kept expecting something more . What happened to the teacher ? What was the point of the final hiding the shirt near a school playground ? What was the narrator 's turn of events ? Nice description of events in a small northern Canada town but as for plot very disappointing . ",1
"This book turned out to be not at all what I was expecting . Shelved in with the mysterythrillers and boasting a creepy title it sounded like it would be an exciting suspenseful story with a strong focus on plot . Instead the book really focused on character redemption . The narrator was quite likable and some of his interior monologue actually made me laugh out loud . And while Pyper created an eerie atmosphere his overuse of nightmares to create that spooky tone became quite frustrating after a while . The role of villain was very loosely applied here and none of the characters really fulfilled that part . I enjoyed Pyper 's writing style and though it did not meet my expectations it was certainly a unique sort of novel . It started out very strongly and unfortunately that strength did not carry through the entire novel . It had some definite high points though so I would not be averse to reading another one of his books but I wo n't be rushing out to purchase more either . ",2
"I read this book because I saw very good reviews and because I liked the previous books by GGK tha I 've read i.e . The Lions of AlRassan and the Sarantine Mosaic duology . Because this is one dealt more explicitly with magic I was resignated not to see the delicious paralels with our own history that you see in the other books . What I was surprised to find is that there is a paralel but this time it is with another work of fiction namely the whole history of Tolkien 's Middleearth . He did to it what he did to the history books of Byzantium and Spain . I would n't restrict it only to Lord of the Rings because he seems to have drawn inspiration from The Silmarillion as well.The elements derived from LotR are obvious the Dalrei=the Riders of Rohan Brennin=Gondor Loren Silvercloak=Gandalf svart alfar=orcs urgath=trolls lios alfar=elfs dwarves Daniloth=LorienRivendell . On the other hand I think that the villain is not based on Sauron but on Morgoth from the Silmarillion and that the character of Galadan is the one based on Sauron . Firstly both the Unraveller and Morgoth are the original god of darkness who hates the Children of Light and wants to rule the mortal world . Rakoth Maugrim the chief bad guy is a more venal version of Melkor . On the other hand Galadan and the Sauron of the Silmarillion are very similar too . They both were originally noble lords but for one reason or another they both turned to the dark side and they both can turn themselves into really big wolves.One detail that bothered me was that the main characters from Earth accepted the existance of other worlds and magic to fast and to easily . the only one who reacted like a normal person would have was Dave Martyniuk.These things make the book less interesting but if you see past that you 'll find a lot of original stuff that will make reading this book worth it . The rest of the charaters are very realistic and human and the places shown are beautifull . I recomend this book to anyone who wants to spend a good time and fantisize a little bit about being in a place of magic . ",3

"I 've had this author recommended to me but I ca n't remember by whom . When I first started the book I was a little wary . The characters initially came across a little bit um flat . But as the story progressed they became more and more colorful and gained depth . At that point I fell right into it . Immediately upon finishing it I drove out to the book store and picked up the next two.There are things about it that I 'd call very classic fantasy . Things that could be seen as very like Tolkien or C.S . Lewis . They have their dwarves and the lios alfar well if those are n't elves by another name I 'll never believe it . And the evil is as evil as evil gets . But if you enjoy good oldfashioned epic fantasy I think this is an excellent read . And unlike SOME epic fantasy authors Goodkind and Jordan I 'm looking at YOU ! this author does n't get overly wordy and drag the series out indefinitely . ",3
"This is really a classic fantasy trilogy ? This is really the guy who wrote Tigana A Song for Arbonne and The Lions of Al Rassan ? I must be missing something . I know that millions of people should not be able to be this wrong but in this case they most certainly are.This is probably one of the worst fantasy novels I have ever read . Nothing that happens seems to be natural but happens because the author wants it to happen . No characters seem to be alive but only exist because the author needs them to exist . The conversations are stilted and dull . Nothing works in this novel.In the reviews there seems to be a consensus that things get better later in the series but I say so what ? This book stinks and the fact is there are better starts to better series . The sad thing is that I was am a big Kay fan.If you like the standard derivative sub par fantasy then eat your heart out . If you are like me and read Tigana read the Lions of Al Rassan A Song for Arbonne read the Sarantine Mosaic heard that Kay 's first work was a trilogy and got real excited to see what he could do with traditional fantasy then do not bother . Trust me you will be very disappointed . ",0
"Strictly speaking fantasy is never believable but I do appreciate an internally consistent world that makes sense if one accepts certain premises . With The Finovar Tapestry trilogy I did n't find that . I simply ca n't believe that just the right five people were assembled on just the right evening to get transported to an alternate reality where they all have mythic roles to fulfill and are all relatively happy to do so.Worse the tone and narrative voice of these novels alternates between the mythic like The Silmarillion in which Kay had a hand and the pedestrian in an uncomfortable and somewhat bewildering way.Still I did n't give up until a little into Book 3 so these books do have somethingcertainly they have legions of fans other than me . But if you want to read this author I would more highly recommend Ysabel which combines the modern and the mythic much more successfullywith an emphasis on the modern rather than the mythicor the entirely fantastic Tigana . ",2
"This is what I finished yesterday whilst lying about in bed pretending to be sleepy . Which I was whenever I got up to do anything but immediately was n't as soon as I lay down to read . Make of that what you will . Rereading this I can hear the objections of my writer 's group pals complaining about overwriting too much description unbelievable circumstances not enough explanation of magic like magic can ever be adequately explained why do the characters do this that or the other thing too this too that . But you know what ? I think most of them would get hooked anyway . I always do . ",3
"I knew that this book was GGK 's first and I also knew it concerned the cliched fantasy theme of downtrodden Good guys must somehow defeat the powerful Bad guys . But I was really hoping that with Kay 's superior writing evident in Tigana the Summer Tree would also be similar in enjoyability . Alas it was not not . I only got halfway thru it before I had to set it aside unable to get interested in it . Mundane names like Kevin and Kim and Paul and Dave mixed in with fantasy names like Loren Silvercloak and Diarmuid and Eilathen and Ailell just did n't work for me . I think the part that really did me in though was during a scene where somebody explains about how the wolves have been coming down from the North . And these are BIG wolves C'mon how many times have we all read that scene during years of reading fantasy ? I will definitely give Kay credit though since these are his first published books . And of course he was influenced by JRR via the Silmarillon that he helped reconstruct . Not a bad book I guess but after reading Tigana I expect much more than this recanned plot . I will probably read A Song for Arbonne or The Lions of AlRassan next . ",1
"A Canadian academic tells a small group of students that is a bit more than they thought he is . He lets them know he is a mage from another world and offers them the chance to journey with him back to this place for a celebration.Dave one of their number is a little suspicious and breaks away ending up being transported to another place and learning to be an axewielding warrior type.There is a bit of a Wounded Land thing going on because their king clinging to power does n't want to present himself as the usual ritual sacrifice to keep things going.Paul one of the students does the whole tree ordeal thing in his place . ",3
"The Summer Tree bears many similarities to Lord of the Rings perhaps not surprising since Kay apparently helped Christopher Tolkien to edit The Silmarillion . Still Kay chooses the right aspects of Tolkien to imitate.The Summer Tree is in a category apart from most epic fantasy because Kay manages to maintain a lofty style similar to Tolkien 's while only occasionally becoming awkward . Kay also creates sympathetic characters whose fates the reader really cares about.Nothing about The Summer Tree is cliche . It successfully uses many common elements of fantasy in ways that are meaningful rather than laughable . Any reader of fantasy should read The Summer Tree . Hopefully they will be convinced that high fantasy after the style of Tolkien is not dead but rather can still be written and enjoyed.Just be prepared to suspend your disbelief and accept the epic nature of the tale .

"I love the Fionavar Tapestry . In these books Kay has woven a beautiful complex story . The setting is Fionavar a gorgeous and enchanted world filled with magic and historya world which reminds me of Narnia or Middle Earth . The story is filled with strong compelling characters both male and female who sometimes have to make difficult choices . At times the story is sad but Kay 's writing is so graceful that I enjoyed even the sad parts.The Summer Tree the first book in the trilogy begins the story very nicely and draws the reader into the deep magic of Fionavar . The part of the story with Paul hanging on the Summer Tree was very beautifully written and at many points reached the magestic feeling of an ancient myth or legend.I would highly recommend The Fionavar Tapestry to anyone who enjoys epic fantasy with powerful magic and attractive settings . ",4
"I need to say upfront that this is a hard novel to get into and begin to feel a connection to its characters . More times than enough the reader will be overcome by the feeling that the contents are all too familiar and they would be right as it gives more than a passing nod to some of the better known epic fantasy novels out there it fully embraces themes countries and characters but this isn & # 8217t a bad mark that I can hold against this book.In the beginning all the characters are portrayed as being rather onedimensional their conversation is stilted and they almost appear to be awkward appearing on the pages of the book but as the storyline progresses and the reader begins to learn more about these people they visibly develop and grow into true threedimensional characters before the readers eyes and a connection is made . With a skilful hand the Author is able to turn trite and shallow characters into fascinating enigmatic people the reader takes a real interest in.The book itself is full of the modern and classic the mystic and mysterious tragedy and victory all set in the flowing and expansive locations of a fantasy world that weaves its spell and stretches the imagination with each page . It doesn & # 8217t matter if the locales seem familiar it is the way the Author takes the familiar and turns it into something new that makes this book wondrous.So why only four thumbs it just wasn & # 8217t long enough and this will mean I will definitely be picking up other books in this series to continue the adventure . Yes I would definitely recommend this book to lovers of the fantasy genre and those who are looking for a new but at the same time oddly familiar read.Originally reviewed on ",3
"Kay certainly creates his own world in Fionavar and he has the writing skills to back it up . I was a bit reticent to buy this book as it starts out in modern times and there was world travel but as a fantasy enthusiast I was glad that I gave this book a read . It has been some time since I read it but I remember book 1 and 3 being the better ones.The trilogy has a dreamlike quality as the author creates a past for the characters that emerges in a somewhat unique fashion . The climaxes throughout the books are really hit and miss . One of best written battles I 've ever read was in book 3 yet in book 2 I felt an entire adventure that spans half the book was a complete waste of my time.The rules for magic appear arbitrary from a systematic viewpoint . ",3
"Sorry to all those people that seemingly loved this book but i am afraid that i found it just woeful . It was the sort of book that gives fantasy a bad name . Indeed it is so inferior to such B grade fantasy as the Belgariad series that it would need a catergory all of its own . As so many other reviewers have said it is an amalgam a hash of Tolkien Narnia Arthurian myths and a myriad of other borrowed themes . Surprisingly upon acknowledgement of these borrowings most reviewers go on to say this it was still a fine book ? The characterisation was stereotypical and superficial with little or no exploration of the potential for culture shock that C21st americans might experience in what would be their technological equivalent of a third world country . There is so little to recommend this book that i am truly surprised that it has such a strong following . ",0
"I bought this book in Ireland finished it in one day and spent the next day scouring every bookshop in Dublin looking for the rest of the series . The plot is engaging and combines elements of Arthurian legends and Tolkien to great effect but the real attraction for me is the prose . This book is beautifully written each sentence seems to have been crafted and honed to perfection . I have since purchased all of GKK 's books and each one has been a masterpiece . Although each of his books has been a joy to read the three books of the Fionavar Tapestry remain my favorites . I have read the books countless times and yet they still have the power to move me to tears . This trilogy is without a doubt one of my most rewarding book purchases ever . ",4
"Very soon into this work I began to feel a sense of amateurishness that I never felt with the Lions of Al Rassan or A Song For Arbonne . The language was nowhere nearly as polished the characters flatter the plot more contrived and imitative . So I looked at the copyrights . Sure enough this was the first of Kay 's published writings . My has he come a long way ! ! I did n't even finish the summer tree . As soon as I found out it would be just another of those Dark Lord bookswhere the good guys battle a persona of ultimate evilI just yawned and chucked it aside . The writing is really kind of corny sometimes I did n't care much about any of the charactersexcept perhaps Peterand the idea is well how shall we say a tad old ? This book is basically a poorer rendition of LOTR mixed with Narnia . Kay matured magnificently in the books that came after peaking I think in The Lions of AlRassan . Given the great stuff he 's written since the Fionavar Tapestry I think we can forgive him his youthful flailing . ",1

"I 've read worse stories than The Fionavar Tapestry . And to be fair its first book The Summer Tree is n't utterly bad . There actually are moments when the story holds your interest . The problem is there are n't many of them and for long stretches this book like its sequel The Wandering Fire suffer from long passages that alternate between floridly contrived and floridly maudlin.Guy Gavriel Kay even panders to the purient interest of juveniles with a character Kevin who has a strangely mystical reaction to sex . The Summer Tree has a lot of exaggerated emotionalism collegeage young adults who act melodramatically as if they were fourteenyearolds . And it has more than its share of pseudointellectualizing deep thoughts spun out of thin air and presented as if they were profound which they are not . Maybe Kay was targeting a 14yearold audience with this book.Kay pilfers from the JesusontheCross story using another of his characters Paul as a sacrifice tied to a tree for three days of course.Be warned readers this is no Ring of the Nibelung here . Despite what some have said about the book it is nowhere near the same league with The Hobbit and although you can tell that Kay is trying hard his descriptive powers are n't on a level with Tolkien 's . The Fionavar Tapestry is a story but it is barely a story . Calling it literature would be going too far and let 's not mention art.Despite its serious flaws from an adult point of view the story is readable and some of the time even enjoyable . That being said there 's just no way the story is good enough to deserve the glowing endorsements given it by such luminous writers as Andre Norton Charles de Lint and Marion Zimmer Bradley all of whom if they are still alive should be ashamed of themselves for giving The Fionavar Tapestry excessively high praise .

"This book is the most haunting work of fantasy that I 've ever read . The premise of the storyfive university students get taken to a fantastic worldis a nice spin on children 's fiction like Eagar 's Half Magic and updates that classic genre for adults . I spent most of the book wishing that I was one of the five students ! The plot is brilliant taking many twists and turns and it takes the reader on emotional highs emotional lows and adds a fair bit of dread into the story as well.I am haunted however by Kay 's voice haunting lyrical and otherworldly . The Summer Tree will make you want to read his other books as well ",4
"Guy Gavriel Kay first made his mark on fantasy by working with Christopher Tolkien on the legendary Silmarillion . His SECOND mark was the Fionavar Tapestry a flawed but prettily written fantasy trilogy . First book The Summer Tree is an entertaining read but Kay was clearly still getting into the idea of writing an original book.Five college students are chatting with a visiting professor Lorenzo Marcus who is accompanied by a peculiar dwarf . Suddenly the mysterious man reveals that he is a mage Loren Silvercloak and whisks them all into the world of Fionavar . He asks them to come stay awhile but none of the students know the strange destinies that bind them to Fionavar . Worse one of them Dave vanishes during the crossing.The four friends soon learn of the sinister political and supernatural problems in Fionavar . An evil wolf is lurking around and the evil svart alfar are killing the beautiful lios alfar elves . Suddenly sweetnatured Jennifer is kidnapped and tortured by the evil god the Unraveller . And Paul offers his own life for the sake of Fionavar to be hung on the Summer Tree as a human sacrifice.Take the worldcrossings of Narnia and the mythic qualities of Tolkien . That pretty much describes Summer Tree . It 's not terribly original and the plot does n't really work until about halfway through the book . But it hints at future grandeur and makes good use of its old Celtic legends and customs in a typical fantasy setting.The biggest flaw of Summer Tree is unoriginality Kay lifts ideas from Robert Zelazny and J.R.R . Tolkien and combines them with a heavy dose of Celtic mysticism and a bit of Arthurian legend . Sure these are hardly unusual but it 's hard not to flinch at a lios alfar describing his people to Jennifer . It 's an exact description of Tolkien 's elves down to a copy of the Undying Lands.Kay 's writing is exceptional however lush detailed and rich . He can enspell you or horrify you . Most compelling is Jennifer 's rape Kay does n't get graphic with the details but her horror and violation are ghastly . At the same time descriptions of the lios alfar visions spells and the strange creatures that populate Fionavar are almost intoxicating . The scenes were Paul hangs on the tree are stunning and powerful.One small problem is that Kay seems to have a little trouble with his lead characters he 's a little too eager to get them into their respective places . None of them seem very disturbed over being snatched into another world and expected to become a part of it . And the college students are actually the flattest people in the whole book the kindly king womanizing prince stern wizard and vindictive priestess come across as much more real.There are deep flaws in The Summer Tree but its luxuriant prose makes it a worthwhile read . But hopefully the second and third books can reach beyond the limitations of the first . ",2
"I read this trilogy when it first came out . The Fionavar world immediately became part of my personal universe a place I revisit every couple of years just to remind myself of its incredible richness . Do n't miss it . ",4
"While the three books that form the Fionavar Tapestry are engaging they all suffer to varying degrees from a loosely scripted and at times implausible plot as well as the inclusion of Arthurian elements that remain contrived and unnecessary except as a hook pandering to the appeal the Camelot legend holds for many readers and that has already elsewhere been overworked . Further I question the plot device of characters that are transported by varying means from our world into parallel fantasy realms that appear popular with many fantasy writers Effectively used to inform the story in Donaldson 's Covenant series other writers turn to its use solely as a clever artifice by which to move characters around.Though better than most of the fantasy fiction about this trilogy lacks the focus of Kay 's later more mature and individual works such as Tigana or Song for Arbonne . Read these if you are seeking serious and original fantasy tales . Save the Fionavar Trilogy for moments of simple unexamined diversion.As The Summer Tree is the weakest book in the trilogy I have only rated it individually two stars whereas I have rated the series three stars overall in my review of The Darkest Road . ",1
"After reading TIGANA I decided to read the first book in this acclaimed series . I did manage to read the whole book which is one good thing because the really bad books I stop reading as soon as they get boring . In short the book does keep your attention . I think most of this is due to the book 's originality . Sure the OTHER WORLD apart from OUR WORLD may not be so originalZelazny 's Chronicles of Amber comes to mindbut there are other parts that ARE original . The hunter in the wild fields . The overall storyline about five young ones going to a world they do n't understand . The summer tree itself . One thing that I noticed was that Kay used FAR too many commas in this book . Some sentences sorta look like this . In the end this is only a mediocre fantasy novel especially when compared to the works being cranked out by such heavyhitters as Robert Jordan Terry Goodkind and George R. R. Martin . ",2
"Guy Gavriel Kay 's The Summer Tree the first in his Fionavar Tapestry trilogy is a satisfying trip into classical fantasy that sometimes moves slowly but rewards readers willing to become emotionally attached to the story and characters.The Fionavar Tapestry tells the tale of five young people who find themselves pulled into a fantasy world . At first just experiencing the strange land is enough to keep them busy but soon they discover that they are at the center of something bigger . Great evil has awakened and seeks to spread itself across the lands . Epic storytelling ensues.Mixing postTolkien influences with Arthurian legends and timehonored fantasy standards The Summer Tree manages to stand up well on its own despite its clear influences largely based on the author 's strong writing . You 'll see plenty of familiar characters with changed names elves orcs and the like but it never feels like More Of The Same.Kay 's prose is rich throughout written with a cadence that almost begs for reading aloud . It is admittedly sometimes a bit much . At times he ramps up the weepiness almost to the point of pretension in a way not unlike Stephen Spielberg does in his films yet it never drags the story down because he is such a fine writer his characters are wellrealized and the story itself is interesting.Action buffs will find the story slow and are encouraged to look elsewhere for reading satisfaction but readers who like the written word and who enjoy characterbased fantasy written in the high style are encouraged to take a look at the first book in Kay 's beloved series . This is epic emotional stuff that is likely to stand the test of time with the best the genre has to offer . ",4
"The Fionavar Tapestry trilogy is wonderful ! I 've reread it several times . Even though this is a fantasy the characters are very real and very human in the midst of all the magic . Parts of it are very tragic but overall a beautiful story with a lot to impart to anyone who reads it . ",4
"I enjoyed this book because it describes a fascinating world but I agree with the other reviewers there was no need to bring in the characters from Earth . Kay would have done well enough just talking about Fionavar . Also I found it odd that the characters from Earth adjusted to life on Fionavar so easily as if they had n't lived their entire lives in a completely different dimension . Before the start of the action in the book they are just like you and me and they 've certainly never imagined that there are any worlds other than Earth . But when Loren Silvercloak comes for them they take him at his word and go with him with barely a murmur . When they 're on Fionavar there 's hardly a hint that they were ever anything else . Kim especially who must have slaved for years to become a doctor abandons her hardearned skills completely to embrace her new calling as a wizard . But these are rookie mistakes . As Kay 's masterpiece Tigana proves he only got better with time and even in this his first book he shows the promise of storytelling mastery that would later be realized . ",3
"I was first introduced to GGK and this book when a visiting Australian friend left it for me when I was in University . I read the first book The Summer Tree and nearly went mad because I could n't find the next . I have read and reread this book enough times to fill a small library and recommended it to more people than I can count.This is smart literate fantasy that takes the fantasies and myths you know from other sources and weaves them into a dark and complicated cloth . GGK takes the very idea of fantasy cliche and comes up with Fionvar the original world which contains the true version of all the stories ever told.Five college students are brought almost by accident to Fionvar to a celebration in honor of an aging king . But they learn that in Fionvar there are no accidents and that they all have talents and destinies which will give them a role in the troubled land.Read this book and all the others in the series ! ",4
"I found this book in a package of the Fionavar Tapestry on the for sale shelf of my fantasy bookstore Nebula . I picked it up read the first page and the next and the third and the next and would have kept going if the clerk had n't come by and told me Look you can read it all in here but you 'd be more comfortable at home ! So I bought it . And devoured it.I love the fact that there are not only two sides darkness and light good and evil but three darkness gray light good unknown evil . I find Guy Kay 's writing quite poetic and I enjoyed every line and every character . ",4
"yet surprisingly captivating at the same time . Something about The Summer Tree held a sort of addicting quality and despite every reservation in my mind telling me not to like this book I found myself quite entertained as I read it . While it is among countless other fantasy novels that follows a Tolkienstyle storyline I thought that it did a better job of it most other such stories that I have read yet it is certainly not comparable in quality to Kay 's later works.My first introduction to Kay was the standalone novel Tigana . It took me a while to really get into Tigana but I really started to appreciate Kay 's eloquent style fleshed out characters and whit in dialogue and plot development . It was n't until after I finished Tigana and thought about it that I realized how great of a book it is . I decided that before going on to read the rest of his works I had better read Fianovar . I did n't quite find the same reading experience here.While the characters in Tigana are well thought and believable those in the Summer Tree are quite the opposite . The reader is given the names of our five heroes right from the get go but Kay does n't feel that it 's necessary to really introduce any of them . He goes on about these five as if you should already know them . Soon comes the mage Loren who will take them into Fianovar . This part I found laughable as only one of the characters really seems to question the sense of this mage appearing out of nowhere and taking them to another world . The other four follow Loren blissfully into Fianovar and seem to go on once they get there as if nothing had really happened . Only on a few occasions do these four characters reference their own world Earth in comparison to this new fantastic world that they seem to accept so easily . Dave the one character who was the exception from the beginning was the only character of the five whose story I really enjoyed . Having been separated from the other four from the time they all entered Fianovar Dave 's story happens later in the book and almost feels like a completely separate tale . His reactions to the events that follow his arrival are much more believable than his counterparts and I thought his part of the book with the tribal hunters was very refreshing.The book as a whole as I mentioned is definitely a clich & eacute . We have a dark lord imprisoned after a war long ago struggling to break free . This dark lord has insidious minions sent out to foil the opposition and wreak havoc in preparation for his arrival . There are also similar races to Tolkien such as the lios alfar who are essentially elves with a different name and of course the stout and noble dwarves . And one fact not to be forgotten the fate of this world of course rests in the hands of the five protagonists that the mage has brought there.Despite these obvious discrepancies Kay imbues this story with his talents as a writer and somehow spins a tale of clich & eacute into a fairly enjoyable yarn . He has the tendency to make you visualize his environments and settings with picturesque quality and towards the end some of the characters do start to grow on you . The dialogue between his characters is one strong points that Kay had even with this novel which I find to be a weak point for many other fantasy authors . Overall as I read this I started thinking of the story as a legend being told . You know how in fantasy novels there is always some great war or fantastic tale that happened hundreds of years before that story actually took place ? This story reads like one of those tales and in that sense it does make the obsurdity of it all that more interesting.If you count yourself as an avid fan of fantasy I would recommend that you pick this up if not to take it seriously than at least to read it for being counted as a classic . If it is your first venture into Guy Gavriel Kay then do n't be too judgmental as the quality and consistency of his later books really does improve and I count Kay among the fantasy greats . ",2
"Okay I just set this book down and I am dying to get my hands on the second one ! Talk about a cliffhanger ! What happens next ? ? ? But perhaps I should n't start at the end I should go back to the beginningI decided to purchase this book because I am always interested in books about ordinary people in extraordinary situations . Fantasy is not my genre of choice although I 've read some great fantasy novels but the description of this one caught my interest . It begins with 5 people in our world who are in short asked to take a journey to another world . Both the best and the most frustrating thing about this book is that throughout the novel I had little to no idea of what was going to happen next why these characters were in this other world and where the story was going . You truly feel as if you are along with Kevin Paul Dave Jennifer and Kimberly on this great adventure . And slowly over the course of the book you begin to see the pattern Mr. Kay is weaving and things begin to make sense . The last 50 pages rush you to a tumultuous ending . I honestly could n't read them fast enough.Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of this book . Oh and while you 're at it get the second one too . Trust me on this one ! ",3
"I mean that wholeheartedly . This is one of those how can you call yourself a fantasy buff if you have n't read The Fionavar Tapestry ? series . For those of you tired of the trite and specious plots in the fantasy great wannabes Eddings et al these books ring with and plumb the depths of the true epic tone Tolkien first introduced . Kay uses traditional mythologyelves the Wild Huntsman etcbut adds his own perspective . I loved his use of the Summer Tree the tree of lifeknowledge as his own take on the crucixion . My only great is that he does n't write new book faster than he doesbut if that 's what it takes for novels of this quality so be it ! ",4
"This is the first Kay book I 've read so I 'm writing this review without a comparison of his other works.I have to say when I first started this book I was preparing myself for dissapointment . The writing seemed simple the storytelling sparse and I really just could n't like the characters.After a few chapters though I really got drawn into the difference of the writing and I absolutely love the story . Reading this book requires you to pay complete attention because there is no extra filler that most fantasy authors throw in to plump up the story and articulate a bit of skill . Every sentence written is integral to the story.There are 5 characters the story follows and at first glance they seem kind of onedimensional . No they 're not vivid tapestries of thoughts and feelings but there are 5 OF THEM and I think the author did an excellent job juggling their different stories . Some of the characters have mysteries that take a while to pan out and some took the entire book to finally come to the surface.I absolutely loved the story . I have to say I loved every minute of it every detail . The elements are extremely familiar yet it felt as though I was reading something entirely new.My biggest critism is one or two scenes felt noticably rushed and relationships bewtween people really could have used a bit of warming up a bit . There was a certain lack of realism from the characters at time which is what made me intitially feel as though I would n't like the book to begin with.This is the first Guy Gavriel Kay book I 've read and I look forward to reading more . ",3
"The Summer Tree leans on gleanings from Tolkien and Zelazny its prose can be stilted at times its beginning is clich & eacute and rather dull and its main characters are rather shallow . Fortunately some of the characters flesh out a bit over the course of the trilogy the borrowed Celtic myth is inserted well enough to overcome much of the clich & eacute and the Arthurian legend is woven into the story so as to pull the course of the tale away from those told by Tolkien . If anything the use of the Arthur legend in the trilogy turned me off since I had read enough of Arthur by the time I was thirteen years old to know that what could be done with the story had already been done . However I try not to fault Kay for using Arthur especially since this is one of Kay 's earliest works and the initial flexing of creative muscles was not yet complete . I do disapprove of the near of his Lios Alfar description from Tolkien but if you are not a very critical person I think you could get past this without it interfering with your enjoyment of the book.On a positive note the main characters while very flat in the beginning were fleshed out a bit and performed some of the most novel selfdestructive selfsacrificial actions I have read in any fantasy novel before or since . These actions and their feeding of the spirits or gods of nature gave the book a very strong Celtic feel . This feeling diminished the negative aspects of the book and heightened my enjoyment of it until by the end of this first volume I was fully resolved to enjoy the rest of the trilogy.As to some of the other complaints concerning the main characters who ca n't admit that many of the people currently walking around college campuses are relatively selfabsorbed often shallow frequently narrowminded and sometimes overly imaginative ? If one begins to read The Summer Tree with this in mind the characters are perhaps a bit predictable but are better developed than some people maintain . ",3
"If you have read some of Kay 's later worksTigana the Last Light of the Sunstop there ! You have seen what he has to offer . Do n't look here back in 1984 when he wrote a book without really knowing what he wanted to say or how to say it . Where do I begin ? OK think of it this way 5 Canadians in King Arthur 's Court . These grad students from Toronto are whisked away into a distant land where they find themselves to be somehow 'chosen ' to save the world.OK OK a bit cliche but I can handle that as long as the plot is good the characters worthwhile . Well they are n't . They 're not quite stock characters . I wish they were because then they would at least have the recognizability of the overly painted masked characters from a medieval morality play . Instead they 're just basically anonymous.And then the magic starts . Not the magic that great stories work on your brain making you want to stay up all night just to get to the next chapter . No this is the magic of Fionavar . Objects will just pop up out of nowhere and we 're told that they have some great power . OK cool I guess . But could you at least tell me something why this thing got here ? Does it have a history ? A reason ? No . And that 's it.The plot stumbles along seemingly skipping pages of very necessary explanation . You ca n't tell if this is some sort of attempt at artistry and mystery or if Mr. Kay just forgot about it . It does n't matter though . You 're still forced to manually restart your suspension of disbelief and try to get back into the book hoping that by page 321 it will have been worth it . So you trudge along.And then a dark lord comes in with orcs to try and take over the world.And then a unicorn comes to save the day . Wait a minute Unicorns ? Yes . Unicorns . Really . Well one unicorn actually but it does n't matter . And it is written to be some sort of grand moment in the history of the world and supposedly it is but you do n't really care because this is a tiny fake world about which we know nothing and one which we have n't seen enough to care about at all ! On the tinyness do n't let the map fool you . This is not some grand work of imagination . The entirety of Fionavar is about the size of Lithuania . Not ancient pagan Lithuania Modern Russiadominated ColdWar shrunken Lithuania . You can ride across this imaginary world in about 3 dayson horseback ! He says so himself.As it happens most all of the important scenes of the book are just like the unicorn stunt . Some ridiculous probably avoidable dilemma is resolved by the sudden appearance of a predictable cliche stroke of good luck . Ugh.To his credit Mr. Kay does have some skill at describing places and feelings . It appears in his later works . All in all however this is a frantic sloppy thing . Do n't bother reading it and do not DARE call it a classic . ",1
"If I had n't read the later works by Kay the Sarantine Mosaic the Song for Arbonne Tigana etc I would be tempted to dismiss ST as a semisuccessful attempt to force together Tolkien Narnia and Cinderella . A group of 5 Canadian students are tranported into a magical land Fionavar discover they possess magical powers and proceed at once to perform all kinds of heroic deeds . Unfortunately there was no real or convincing character development in the book and the eventual transformation is unconvincing and falls flat.The book gives a taste of Kay 's imagination ingenuity and his ability to rip facts and fiction from various sources historical tribal spiritual and to work them into his own narative . Nonetheless the final result is still raw clumsy and disjointed . The ripoffs from Tolkien appear especially blatant and the Arthurian elements did n't work for me . Still if I look at how well this strategy succeeds in the later Tigana or Sarantium books I can definitely see Kay has discovered something that works.Thea above comments notwithstanding the Trilogy is not unenjoyable . its main significance however is that of a portent of the emergence of Kay as one of the great fantasy writers of our time . ",2
"I absolutely loved everything about Guy Gavriel Kay 's standalone novels Tigana and A Song for Arbonne so it was with great excitement that I downloaded the newly released audio version of The Summer Tree the first novel in his famous The Fionavar Tapestry.In The Summer Tree we meet Loren Silvercloak a wizard who has traveled from the world of Fionavar to Toronto to fetch five university students three guys and two girls who are needed to help fight an ancient evil force that has been bound under a mountain for centuries . It is awakening has adversely affected the weather and threatens the future of Fionavar . The students are transported to the capital city of Caer Paravel no wait wrong book Paras Derval and each discovers that she has an important role to play in this strange land 's upcoming upheaval.If I had read The Summer Tree when it was first published in 1984 perhaps I would have enjoyed it more . Or at least I would have been more forgiving back then but at this point in my life with many years of reading fantasy epics behind me I just had a hard time mustering up much enthusiasm for this story.Besides the parallels to Tolkien and Lewis which you will have already noticed we 've got dwarves who live under mountains elflike creatures who live in the forests names which require hyphens apostrophes or other funny symbols NaBrendel M & oumlrnir RaTermaine T'Varen names of evil things which sound Russian Rakoth Starkadh svart alfar Rangat Bl & oumld Khath Meigol urgach nasty creatures who are minions of the bad guy a girl who finds out she 's the next seer a hero who must sacrifice himself to save the blighted land . etc . Much of it is derived from ancient myth and legend and it 's presented in Kay 's eloquent and slightly overwrought style . This will likely please those who are looking for that sort of weighty epic but to me it just felt heavy . I have no doubt that this is caused by reading this too late in my fantasy vita I was looking for something new so if you 're not relating to me here I encourage you to give The Summer Tree a try . Every fantasy fan should read Guy Gavriel Kay.Kay 's use of the five modernday characters is a bit perplexing . Their reactions to being brought to a parallel world with an ancient culture were unconvincing as they immediately adapt to the customs of Fionavar without much trepidation or wonder . They did n't seem concerned about how or when they 'd get back to their world what their family and friends might be thinking or what might happen if they very likely died in Fionavar . They never talk about modern conveniences like cars guns and telephones . They go along with the patriarchic culture and though they are welleducated they do n't use their modern knowledge to any advantage . Perhaps they will in the sequels but there is so far no indication that they are thinking that way which baffles me . I 'm wondering why Kay used modernday heroes at all.As for the audio production it 's produced by Penguin Audio and read by Simon Vance one of my favorites so it 's well told . However Vance 's Canadian accent makes me cringe and since our five heroes are all Canadian that 's a lot of cringing.I expected to love The Summer Tree so I had purchased the second book in The Fionavar Tapestry too and I will probably read it at some point . But I greatly prefer Guy Gavriel Kay 's more recent fiction which is really wonderful stuff . ",2
"I loved this book . I only really have one complaint . Kay 's writing style is a little difficult to get into . He is writing in a high fantasy style for a high fantasy world . I really did appreaciate that but it does make the book a little less accessable to the reader.The characters are interesting and engaging . There are some true personalities in these books and they beg to be written about more and more . It 's a great start to this series . ",3
"This is without a doubt one of my top five fantasy epics of all time . Beautifully written and highly imaginative . I enjoyed watching the characters come to terms with their demons throughout . The novel . Exciting battles too . I highly recommend you read it . ",4
"The Summer Tree and indeed all of The Fionavar Tapestry is a delightful fantasy full of strange worlds important events and vivid characters.One gets the impression that Kay chose every word with care rather than ripping through the story as quickly as he could write . A friend who recommended this series to me said It 's kind of like Tolkien but without the throw away Boromir characters.Obviously Kay and Tolkien will be compared and contrasted since Kay helped compile The Silmarilion . Also any writer who attempts a fantasy trilogy is bound to be compared to Tolkien at some point . I find his writing style remarkably dissimilar and enjoy both authors immensely.What Kay does exceedingly well is allow me to care greatly about his characters . I do n't have to work at it like I do with some writers . They have depth and unique personalities all their own.Comparisons with Tolkien aside I think The Summer Tree and its sequels are excellent reads for folks who want more from their fantasy than a riproaring hack and slash dungeon in literary form . These are GOOD books and they deserve to be enjoyed savored and pondered.The occasional overly romanticized situation between a couple of the characters as well as an annoying writing tick I wo n't give it away as it 's most likely a pet peeve of my own prevents me from giving this series five stars but I 'd give it 4.5 if I could . ",3
"Guy Gavriel Kay is one of my favorite authors and as such I had very high hopes for this novel . Unfortunately his Tolkien influence not only shows here but it overwhelms the book entirely.The plot is relatively straightforward five young people are led through a portal into another world by a mysterious mage and his sidekick . They 're told they 're only there for a celebration a few days at the most and then they can go home . But things go wrong from the very beginning . One of them does n't make it through with the other four and the plot just gets jumbled from there.It sounds like standard fantasy fodder and it should be . Unfortunately the language is almost archaic and the dialogue stilted . Sometimes entire pages are devoted to scenery . It may have worked well when Tolkien wrote but in today 's society I expect a fastpaced story full of intrigue and adventure.At times Kay offers glimpses of his talent by creating a character so wonderful Sharra and a culture so rich the Dalrei it takes my breath away . Unfortunately those glimpses were few and far between . The main characters are bland and uninteresting with the possible exception of Kim Ford and they 're all much too quick to accept this strange new world they 've been thrown in if a mage came up to you and plunged you through a portal would n't you be a little more resistant to that kind of change ? .If you 're a Tolkien fan chances are good you 'll enjoy THE SUMMER TREE . For the rest of us this book is best left on the shelves . ",1
"My sister insists that Tigana is a better read that Fionavar Tapestry . Somehow even though I have read both and loved Tigana I cant bring myself to judge Tigana over the Fionavar tapestry . The magic in FT is that you can bond to the central characters . You see them react and embrace their experiences thats literally out of their world . There is a bit of everything in FT arthurian legend romance philosophical concepts all meshed into a very human experience . I also loved the central struggle between light and dark though I have read reviews that remark that it was modeled on JRR Tolkien 's works . I feel that this is a jewel in the crown of Kay 's works . His first His warmest . ",4
"Nice story a little too much like Donaldson in the sense of world traveling but overall a great little story that starts to pick up steam towards the later half of the book and into Wandering Fire the sequel . Builds a nice little set of worlds and uses the overpowered evil entity plot device pretty nicely . Again it was 1984 when he wrote it so it was n't so overused then . You 've really should read this series howevera fantasy must read . Sometimes Kay can be a little pretentious but overall this is a great read and very accessible . There is one thing that Kay probably does better than anybody and that is character development . This series is no exception ",3
"Book lacks something that keeps it from being a great read . It seems rushed or forced . ",2
"The first two hundred pages of this book are such a jumbled mess I stopped reading it several times . But my husband promised me it gets better and thankfully he was right . If you can get past the first half of the book with its shifting pointofviews poorly realized characterizations and the epic presumption a gem lies in wait . In the latter pages of the book Guy Gavriel Kay 's mastery comes to light . It 's worth it ! That being saidTiganais still my favorite start there if you 've never read anything by Kay . HisSailing to Sarantium Sarantine Mosaic Book 1books are wonderful too . Then you 'll be able to trust that this series will indeed live up to the recommendations.Enjoy ! ",4
"This book was one of the most uninteresting books that I have ever read . I am not a fantasy book reader but I saw the reviews so I thought I would give this book a try . I really thought that there were way too many characters in this book.I will admit that it was really helpful that the author did put together a listing of who is who . Maybe it is because I am not an avid fantasy reader but I just found myself extremely bored reading this book . The 5 main characters did not interest me along with the storyline . After reading this book I will not read another fantasy book for a long time . ",0
"This was the first Guy Gavriel Kay book I read and at the time I picked it up I was having a hard time finding any fantasy novels I liked Kept reading Mckinley over and over . This book introduced me to the Fionavar Tapestry that is key to understanding his other books such as Tigana . I have since read the Tapestry trilogy Tigana and Song for Arbonne . This book is about a group of college students who are taken to a world where each discovers their true identity . In finding that identity they also learn more about the new world they are now woven into . There is of course an impending war gruesome creatures deaths deceptions and deep romance . If you are looking for a new author to read as I was I would suggest starting with the Fionavar tapestry and try Kay out ! I look forward to and hope to enjoy all his works . ",4
"The first thing I would say about this book is that it is a slow burner . For probably the first third of the book you are wondering about whether to carry on or not the first time you read it at least ! but if you can stick with it it does become worth your while.The history and mythology that GGK has put into the Fionavar Tapestry are things that dreams are made of certainly for every Fantasy fan.One of the common complaints about this book seems to be that the five friends adjust too well to their 'new ' world . My reply is that it 's amazing how normal things can seem to be when you 're with friends oThis book is an excellent introduction to the series and also sets the second book up very nicely.This trilogy along with Tigana by the same author firmly remains on my Favourites shelf ! ",4
"'The Summer Tree ' is the first book of Guy Gavriel Kay 's 'Fionavar Tapestry ' trilogy . It is a cross world fantasy where five college students from Toronto booooo ! are invited by the mage Loren Silvercloak to travel to Fionavar 'the first of all worlds ' . It is a world of gods elves dwarves and a dark lord imprisoned under a mountain . The book owes something to Tolkien but also has Norse Celtic and Greek mythological influences . I enjoyed it very much but I am not blind to its faults . As many reviewers have noted the five visitors from our world seem to adapt to the new world almost seamlessly so much so that it seems unnecessary as a plot device since it really adds little to the story . Secondly the idea of Fionavar being 'first of all worlds ' just does n't make much sense . Fionavar seems too small geographically everything seems to one or two days away by horse from anywhere else and historically Rakoth Maugrim being defeated just 1000 years ago and not much happens in between it seems to be as important as it supposed to be . It is stated several times that if Rakoth Maugrim is not defeated he will rule in all worlds not just in Fionavar does that mean if he is defeated in Fionavar that our world will be free of evil ? Does n't seem likely . Anyway these are minor annoyances Kay is a gifted writer and 'The Summer Tree ' is well worth reading for fantasy enthusiasts . ",3
"It is not often that you come across a book so breathtakingly good that it instantly takes a place of honor among the best books you 've ever read . This and the entire Fionavar tapestry is such a book . Written in beautiful prose in the style of the Silmarillion this book proves that Kay has emerged as a worthy successor to JRRT in the fantasy genre . ",4
"I was looking for a story where the characters move back and forth between the mundane world and a fantasy world . I picked this one up intrigued by the idea of five Canadian college students being transported to another world called Fionavar . Although I was warned that this book was Kay 's first and not one of his best.A lot of elements in the story are derivative of Tolkien . Kay has his own version of Tolkien 's creatures orcs elves dwarves characters Gandalf Sauron Saruman and plot elements the return of the king the war against Mordor the riders of Rohan . If I let that bother me too much I would really be limiting my enjoyment of fantasy literature in general . Besides there was a good bit of originality here too.I found the characters and their situation to be somewhat unbelievable right from the beginning . They unquestioningly accept the existence of this other world and once there fit right into their roles . They have an immediate grasp of the the mythology and politics of the place . Even though they are referred to as the strangers they might as well have been from Fionavar to begin with for all the difference it made that they were from Toronto . The female characters are especially weak I had no feeling at all for their personalities motivation or relationship to the other characters . I had trouble getting past their cutesy names too . Spoils the mood . I did like Dave though . I understood what he was all about and he was a very believable regular guy from the beginning of the book to the end . Those were the parts I liked best.Some of the writing especially the dialogue is a little bit awkward . I sometimes found it hard to follow the frequently changing point of view . Although it is mostly delineated into separate sections sometimes the point of view seemingly changes in the middle of a paragraph making it difficult to understand whose thought you are reading now.Based on recommendations I do plan to read some of Kay 's other books maybe Tigana next but I do n't think I will finish the Fionavar series . ",2
"Please accept my humble apologies . I did not like this book . I know that it is considered a fantasy classic that thousands of fans adore it and that Kay is one of the genre 's alltime greats . But The Summer Tree just does n't have it . Oh sure the writing is competent and the characters are above average but the overall work does n't add up to anything . It 's a hodepodge of elements collected from elsewhere that never justifies its own existence.Just look at the fight scenes . Bad guy sends thousands of incompetent minions into battle . Good guys fearlessly march out to meet them . Despite being pompous fools who are vastly outnumbered good guys somehow win without getting a scratch . Sound familiar ? Maybe that 's because we 've already seen this happen thousands of times in countless other fantasy novels . Any good guy who 's ever in danger gets rescued by a lastsecond magic trick . And some claim that the dialogue in this book is special . Not so . For instance head villain Rakoth sounds so much like a comic book cliche bad guy that I almost laughed out loud.Which is n't to say that the book is entirely bad . Some scenes such as a character 's internal reflections on a past incident during a moment of selfsacrifice do strike a genuine emotional chord . It 's interesting to note that Kay 's better works are the ones that focus on smaller personal stories rather than grandiose struggles between good and evil . Perhaps he should have skipped this trilogy entirely and gone straight to his later novels . Certainly Tolkien and Donaldson among others have done far better at classical fantasy than this freshman effort . ",2
"Well I read the Sarantium series and on the strength of those very good books plus the strong reviews on here I picked up the 'Summer Tree ' for awell summer read ok sorry ! Anyway I struggled and struggled through it . NOT a pageturner but I hate not finishing what I start and pay full price for ! . The Summer Tree just seems so random and unconvincing . Obviously it is fantasy but there is absolutely no explanation or even much hint as to why these five Canucks are somehow chosen to save Fionavar . Maybe it is explained in later books . The dialogue lacks any humor whatsoever which might have made the story more tolerable . There are just these heavily oppressed characters who suddenly become great fighters or seers or whatever . How a graduate student rides a horse for 5 days and fights from horseback is just too ludicrous . I am a little sad I wo n't know the end of the story but just a very little . There are just too many good books out there to justify finishing the series and that pains me but just ca n't bring myself to do it . ",1
"I agree with the reviews that praise this effort . Well written well plotted and much more elegant than standard high fantasy this series just seems a cut above other fantasies in almost all departments . We reread very few books in our house but this set is kept on the the readagain shelf with Lord of the Rings and a few others.One note . Some people love Kay 's other work like Sarantium or Tigana and do n't like this . Some like this and do n't like the others . Understood . I 'm in the latter category . They are just two different kinds of books . So if you are familiar with other Kay books just be warned that this trilogy has an entirely different feel . And for what it 's worth Ysabel sort of falls in between the two bodies of work . ",4
"Next to Kay 's later works this one stinks . I stopped somewhere under 100 pages . The characters are loosely conceived . Their behavior and dialogue are stilted . ",1
"I could not help but put this book down . I must be fair and note that perhaps I have merely grown out of the insipidity that the fantasy industry thrives on but disclaimers aside this series is still terrible . The plot is implausible and that is truly saying something for a fantasy novel being inherently implausible and the writing is amateurish . Honestly I was confused when I begin reading thisperhaps I had mistaken the author 's name on the cover ? Unfortunately no but I surmise that this is some of Kay 's earliest work and it is apparent . The Fionavar Tapestry demonstrates none of the laudable elements of Kay 's later writing . So if you 're interested in Guy Gavriel Kay avoid this awful example of writing and check out some of his later books the Sarantine Mosaic was excellent . ",0
"I know what you 're going to say . Fantasy novels are n't meant to be realistic that 's why they 're called FANTASY . I 'm an avid fantasy reader . Realistic in a fantasy world for me means could this really have happened on this world ? Do the everyday normal things that happen in the book fit with how things really happen ? For the supernatural things that happen do they fit with the concepts of how things work on this fantasy world ? There are instances throughout the book that made me shake my head . For example 5 average college students are sent from our modern world to a fantasy world this is realistic based on my definition because of how things work in the fantasy world Kay is creating . None of these people has probably ever ridden a horse in hisher life . In this fantasy world they are thrust into horses are the primary form of transportation . What would happen if you took 5 of your friends threw them on horses for the first time ever and told them to gallop at full speed ? I agree Somehow no one seems to have a problem in the book . To me this is unrealistic . I would expect that if I could stay on the horse at all I would be bruised and battered . Who knows.This is only one example of this sort of thing in the book . There are many more.How would you react if you had a big ugly troll charging you swinging a battle axe at your head ? Do n't tell me you would naturally dodge the blow and decapitate the troll with a quick thrust of your Swiss Army Knife . Explain to me how someone who 's never been in a fight can automatically kill dozens of baddies in his first battle.I do n't mind if it turns out that this guy happened to be special but the same sort of phenomenon happens to each of the lead characters.It would be more believable if each of the characters was plucked from around the world individually . Or not all of the characters turned out to be superheroes . But 5 people that happened to hang out together at college There is just too much coincidence . I could give several more examples of the same sorts of things for each character.All that being said it 's really not a bad read . If you can look past the unrealistic nature of certain circumstances and the predictable nature of the book you will enjoy it . I 've also heard that this was an earlier work of Kay 's and that his later stuff is better . Tigana for instance though I have not read it ",2
"I read this series well after it was published and am deeply sorry I did n't get turned to Kay earlier . The Fionavar Tapestry is awesome in its scope and heartbreakingly beautiful in its writing . Kay is truly a master of the art of the written word with the power to draw you into the story like no author I have ever experienced to make you laugh and cry and love with the characters and to enable you to fully experience the bittersweetness of life as he describes it in his books . He is simply a brilliant writer and one that should not be missed . ",4
"I really like this series . Kay has some real imagination and beauty to his books . His ideas are truly original and his world is on full of wonder.Nonetheless I found his writing style a hindrance to being fully immersed in this book and the following books of the series . He is choppy and downright confusing at times . It is not that he is a complex writer I do n't mind that . It is that he seems to be trying to be complex and comes off being vague and confusing.With that said this book is one of the better ones of the fantasy genre . And as a fellow Canadian with Kay I wish him all the best ! ",2
"An early series by Kay who was still learning his trade . Had some poor transitions from one development to the next but the action was fast paced and kept your interest . It many respects it is a rehash of several mythologies including NorseCeltic deities and the Arthurian legend but it is cleverly done . Having read many of his later works you can see that he was still developing his style as a writer . Worth a read if you are fond of the author or the subject matter ",2
"I wanted to give this book more stars I really did and three and a half stars would be a more accurate description . The book showed definite promise and the world of Fionavar is an intriguing one but there were just a few too many things wrong with it for me to give it a better rating.In The Summer Tree the first book in the Fionavar Tapestry series by Guy Gavriel Kay five college students from our world are taken into another world 'the first of the worlds ' by mage Loren Silvercloak . Soon all of them become more than just visitors they become entwined with the land and the looming fight against the Unraveller . All of them strangers from another world begin the path to finding their destinies in a world that is not their own . The ending to the book is a cliffhanger so I would recommend having the second book handy upon finishing the first.Kay writes beautifully . His language is often poetic and sometimes musical and his style was definitely one of the more enjoyable aspects of the book.Despite the fact that Kay is obviously a masterful author the book seems less than perfect for the following reasonsThe book launches with very little explication about who the characters are or what really drives them . Each is given a few lines but not much more . Though more is revealed as the novel progresses I was nonetheless slightly annoyed with the way the character development progressed . One would think that if readers are to bond with these characters for three whole books more would be given in the way of making us care what happens to them . On the same note I thought that the swiftness with which the five were launched into the thick of things was a bit unrealistic . I can only hope that this will be better explained in the later novels.Kay sometimes overwrites passages trying to milk too much emotion out of them . If you do it all the time it 's less powerful when you really need it . I found the parts about Kim Ford becoming the Seer to be rather well silly . However I immensly enjoyed the description of the Dalrei and enjoyed the character of Sharra the fiesty heir to the crown of Cathal of whom I 'm assuming we will see more of in later novels.One last note I was rather baffled by the amount of sex scenes in the novel . While they were n't particularly explicit I did wonder what purpose Kay what trying to fulfill by including them . And I 'm sorry but lines such as Cursing a hardon he kicked into his breeches and slipped on the loose sleeved doublet Diarmuid had given him just do n't belong in fantasy novels.Despite all this I 'm not ready to give up on the series because as I 've said it shows promise . After finishing the novel readers will definitely be ready to find out more about the world of Fionavar and how the rest of the story weaves . ",2
"I have read these books years ago . I ca n't see as good as I used to and need to be able to enlarge the print . Kindle allows me to do this so I wonder why they are not on Kindle . The Summer Tree is but it not available at this time . Come on guys . Why ? Sandy S ",4
"This is my alltime favorite Fantasy series . I was 12 years old when I first started reading these books and I say started because I continued to read them over and over from then on . When it comes to books I have few other loves besides Fantasy so believe me when I say I 've read my share . This story is passionate adventurous magical and exquisitely heartbreaking . Though admittedly this first book is not the best of the three . It is more of a stage setter for the allimportant books 2 and 3 . I also must admit that it can be a bit confusing in the begining mostly because it is written in the hight of emotion and the writer clearly already knew everything that was going to happen when he started whereas we the reader do not have a clue . But it is adoringly written and you will find yourself quickly falling in love with various characters all too easily.I grew to love each of the characters as though they were people I truly knew and felt concern and admiration for . The center focus being around 5 university students who suddenly find themselves swept up in a cause far bigger than anything they could have imagined . The fate of the world and many more worlds as they quickly learn lies in the balance as an epic battle begins on the first of all worlds Fionava . Kevin Paul Kim Jennifer and Dave soon dicover who they really are and what their lives have been heading towards since the day they were born . They are accompanied by many colorful characters each with a story of their own and an important role to play in the fate of Fionavar.The picture painted by Kay is one of beauty and emotion with fastinating mythology and detailed character depth . To quote another of my favorite books the Princess Bride it has fighting torture revenge giants monsters chases escapes true love and a few welcome additions such as magic Gods and legends.I was passed this book by my mother and I quickly passed it on to all my closest friends to which it easily became their favorite fantasy series as well . You will laugh and cry and certainly cheer long before the end of book 3 . I promise . ",4
"Note that this review is applicable to The Summer Tree as well as the other two books in the Fionavar Tapestry.I vividly remember encountering Guy Kay 's books for the first time . I was in my early 20s and could n't afford to buy books so I was working my way through the public library 's two shelves of fantasy and scifi paperbacks . Every time I went to the library I would see the Guy Kay books and be attracted by their gorgeous cover art . Then I would read the backs and think the plots sounded dreadfully boring . Also specific to the Fionavar Tapestry I read the back and noted that it was about 4 modern characters who transition to a fantasy realm . Even at that age I thought that was a keenly stupid plot device . To this day I do n't really care for urban fantasy.Eventually though I ran out of other options and checked out The Summer Tree . I read the first few pages and was disgusted just how I knew I would be . then I read a few more and never even remembered that I was supposed to be hating on the plot . I was sucked right into the story entranced by the language he used and the poetic value of his prose . Guy Gavriel Kay makes you want to slow down and savor every word . Description is sometimes stark sometimes rich but never overembellished or there to pad the story . Everything has a place everything has a point everything is relevant to the story.That last paragraph is pretty fanciful . I should suffice to say that once I forgot I was against the premise I was sucked into the story utterly and completely . It was beautiful to read but I did n't think of it like that . I just knew I could n't stop reading did n't want to stop reading and never wanted it to end . It was like infatuation.The plot is a collection of several legends and fantastic stories . GGK borrows from many favorites as well as lesser known tales to weave his tale everything from the Arthurian Legend to the Black Cauldron . At first I thought this would be silly but he weaves it with such talent that you can only think but of course.It 's a classic fantasy trilogy chronicling the fight of good against evil where the evil is the ultimate blackest of evils . But even while there 's the ultimate evil to fight there are lesser evils . We 're given glimpses into the lives and thoughts of the characters on the other side and learn that not everything is black and white . This is a common trait in GGKs books evil is n't evil for evil 's sake 99 % of the time some people are just bad of course . There is depth and understanding . Sometimes there 's explanation and sometimes there 's closure . The reader is led to empathize and sometimes even hope for redemption.There are several reviews on here already that read like book reports so I wo n't bother to rehash plot points . I will simply say that all of the main characters make you love them as well as many of the tertiary characters . You feel their emotions with them without feeling melodramatic . Once I got over my initial reticence I never felt as though the plot was contrived . Characters grow and change naturally over time . They make mistakes bad things happen to good people some of them irrevocable . It 's difficult for me to express the amount of love I 've come to feel for this trilogy of books over the years . I reread them every so often and they never fail to move me . As a matter of fact just writing this review is making me think it 's time for another reread.The best way to express how much I love this trilogy is repeat what I told a friend once You 're so lucky . You get to read them for the first time . There 's nothing like that first time with these books.All of GGK 's early books are on my 5star desertisland booklist . The Summer Tree and the entire Fionavar Tapestry were the first . They hit no sour notes there are no awkward moments poor phrasing or anything else to startle a reader out of that special place reached only with a perfect story . ",4
"I have read many fantasy series Rosenberg Tolkien and Donaldson but none match the emotion and depth of this sweeping epic . Quite simply the best series I have ever read and the only one that moved me and touched my soul . Even his other works fail to match this one . ",4
"the first time i read this book i was in high school just starting to get into fantasy . it did n't do anything for me and i did n't bother with the rest of the trilogy . several years later i found it getting dusty on my bookshelf and decided to give it another try . within 20 pages i was completely hooked and could not imagine what i missed that first time . i 'm not usually a big fan of books that integrate our world with a fantasy world i think fantasy is better when it 's set apart on its own it 's somehow less plausible when the author tries to give a world of magic a place in what we call reality . but this trilogy is the glorious magnificent exception to that rule . finishing the book for the second time finally understanding what all the fuss was about i just about ran to the bookstore to buy the other two . now i 've read them all more times than i can count and i cry every time . from the hedonistic garden country cathal to the majestic kingdom of brennin to the harsh plains of the dalrei the world of fionavar is breathtakingly real and heartbreakingly beautiful . kay weaves a spell with his words . reading many of these reviews i have to disagree with those who prefer kay 's later works . i have read both tigana and a song for arbonne and while both are above average neither comes close to the majesty of the fionavar tapestry . true they are both somewhat more polished . but the sheer rawness of the writing in the fionavar tapestry is what makes it so powerful . none of the edges are blunted the emotions bite deeply and ring true more so than in his other novels.READ THIS BOOK . i guarantee you 'll run to the bookstore to buy the other two .

"All of Guy Gavriel Kay 's books are extremely well written . The stories are amazing and the worlds that he creates draw you in every time . The three books of the Fionavar Tapestry The Summer Tree The Wandering Fire and The Darkest Road are my absolute favourites though . I wo n't go into a long synopsis here I do n't think that 's what a review is for anyway but I will say you ca n't read these books and be unchanged by the time you have finished . My paperback copies are worn out . I 'm so glad the books are now on Kindle ! ",4
"I read these books the first time they came out . I had to special order The Darkest Road because my bookstore never got it in . From the first I found these books to be beautifully written perhaps only a woman can understand the tortured beauty of Jennifer or the sacrifices Kim made to become a seer . To say that any of Kay 's characters lack depth is to show yourself not well read or a bigot of some kind . I am an English teacher and every year I recommend these books to my students . Those who read them come to me to thank me every time . I think these three books are more emotionally satisfying and adult than Tolkien . I read them at least once a year myself . All of Kay 's books are lovely and I await them anxiously . But The Summer Tree trilogy is Kay 's best and most satisfying work ! ! ! ! ! ",4
"I remember the first time I read this series . It took me four days it would have taken three but there was a delay in getting the last two from a friend . I was moved more deeply than any other work in fantasy I had read . I remember staying up until 6 AM I was in theater at the time reading them and weeping my way through the last third of the last book in the series.Without doubt Kay invokes all that is deep in us as people who have created mythos and myths to carry us . He evokes all that is strong in us while showing that even the mythic have their weaknesses . While later works of Kay 's may be more polished this is the raw material that he still works from.As with every reading when I finished my recent reread I was almost traumatised to leave the world that had been so well crafted . The end leaves all satisfied but there is a bittersweet flavor to it since the people he has created are no longer accessable to the reader.This is the series I would want while stranded on a desert island . And I can not think of anything more to say than that . ",4
"The Summer Tree is the first book in The Fionavar Tapestry series continuing with The Wandering Fire and The Darkest Road.At Loren Silvercloak the mage 's bidding Kevin Kim Jennifer Paul and Dave five University students from Toronto 'cross ' into the Kingdom of Fionavar the First of all Worlds to help him in an oncoming war against Rakoth the Unraveller and thus fulfil their destinies.Like the five heroes the reader is teleported into a land of magic and fantasy which the author only describes little by little . Although certainly used as a stylistic device this sometimes makes it hard to understand the ins and outs of certain characters ' actions . In the same vein I also found the few sex scenes somewhat a bit out of place and unpoetic . Anyway looking back upon it I realize these were just details.And indeed as you turn the pages and learn more about the people and history of Fionavar and about the role the heroes have to play in it the book really turns out to be enthralling and hard to put down . I particularly enjoyed the third part where Dave is taken in by a tribe of hunters called the Dalrei and learns about their customs and rites to finally risk his own life for them.Although at first I was a bit sceptical about the mixing of today 's world with fantasy in the end I really liked this book a lot and I 'm looking forward to reading the next two . So do n't let the first 150 pages or so get you down and read on it 's definitely worth it ! ",3
"Loved the book from beginning to end . Great story with awesome characters . Could n't wait to start the next one . Word ",4
"The Fionavar Tapestry left me with mixed feelings . On one hand some of the writing is very well done and some parts of the story particularly Dave 's first meeting with the Dalrei are moving and enjoyable to read . On the other hand the story is n't very original and I never felt very involved with the characters . The women in particular seemed to be poorly drawn and were n't very likable.The story revolves around five college students who have been brought to the fantasy land of Fionavar a Middle Earthlike world which Kay tells us is the one true world . The world of the college students which is our own world is but an imperfect reflection . Kay tells us that problems in Fionavar will be reflected in all other worlds including our own but never gives any examples of this.The biggest problem with the trilogy is that the students interact amazingly well with Fionavar and its inhabitants right from the start . I never understood why it was necessary to have the students originate in our world because the story as a whole would change very little and would make more sense if they had been born and raised in Fionavar . The students never use the knowledge and skills they 've gained in their own world to aid Fionavar . For instance when they travel back home why do n't they take firearms and manuals on how to manufacture gunpowder and grenades with them on their return to Fionavar ? Fionavar is a world at war with an ancient evil and yet they never mention or express a desire for any modern weaponry or a modern means of communication or transportation . Furthermore the students never get homesick they never have trouble adjusting to this new and different culture and oddly enough when one of them is killed no one ever wonders what they 'll tell his family and friends back home.After the students are taken to Fionavar Kay also adds King Arthur and Lancelot to his tale . For some unexplained reason Guinevere has been reincarnated but Arthur and Lancelot have to be resurrected . Once in Fionavar Arthur and Lancelot do n't actually do much and almost seem to be superfluous . Arthur 's dog actually comes across as more heroic and has more personality Arthur does . It felt like Kay could n't decide whether he wanted to write an Arthurian novel or a fantasy novel and so decided to blend the two with results that are less than satisifying.There is a subtle current of sexism running throughout the trilogy that made me uncomfortable . While some of the most powerful people in Fionavar are women the women are all involved in either religion or mysticism of some sort . When it comes to battles the women are either kept on the sidelines and expected to heal the injured or are left at home . Kay describes nearly every woman as being earthshatteringly beautiful and seems to feel that a woman must be beautiful to be important . Part of Fionavar 's history involves a woman called Lisen who apparently never did anything more than look beautiful and act as an aid to her husband yet the entire world still mourns her passing . ",1
"Kay has some interesting ideas but I was a little surprised in reading that most reviewers liked the Summer Tree so much . I found it very much needed the directing of a really good editor who could point out that making a jumble of a plot instead of a more straightforward story is going to disturb even those readers who are fairly bright . I confess that I 've not read a lot of fantasies Lewis Tolkien L'Engle Pullman Heinlein Azimov and not for years . Lately I was introduced to Robin Hobb and have to admit that after her book in nine volumes nothing could compete with her glittering writing nor her literary bent . This is by way of admitting that comparisons are odious.G I shall read the other two Kay books in the Fionavar trilogy and I also have Tigana and two other of his books . I also have three George R.R . Martin books clearly I 'm on a kick . It may also help to know that I 'm seventyfour and might have other stronger views about reading material . ",2
"This is a very good book that I would highly recomend . The storytelling plot and the way the story is interwoven are all truly masterful.There are issues that I have with the book . For most of the first book he repeatedly refers to characters by both first and last name . Everytime every dialogue every mention . That really began to annoy me and I had to train my mind to skip over the surnames and just read the given names . I also felt that the book was slightly slow in begining . However the book and the series does nothing but build.It is a very good opening and the next book draws you even more in . I had heard great things about Kay as an author and this series is my first taste of his writting . Currently about 23 through the second book of this series I am very much hooked at this time.Is this book perfect ? No not by any stretch . But it is extremely good . As I said I would n't say that dialogue is Kay 's strong point and at times his word selection could be better . But few storytellers weave a more masterful tale than Kay . ",3
"didnt establish a good flow of occurances and was just unrealistic characters . He just didnt make the characters act in any realistic fasion even for fantasy writing ",1
"I can not understand how 99 people can give this book 4 or 5 stars ? ? ? I could n't even get past the first chapter as this was utterly UNBELIEVABLE even for a fantasy book.We have the 'reclusive genius ' Lorenzo Marcus making a rare speaking engagement at a college . Marcus and his sidekick Mattwho are n't who they appear to be but more on that later . set their sites on Kim Ford who they need for some 'mission ' . They also just happen to need four other people for their team and VOILA ! Kim just happens to be accompanied by four other people . How convenient.After the speaking engagement Kim and her cronies wisk Mr Marcus and Matt away from the throng of admirers to go back to Mr Marcus 's hotel . But wait ! They are being followed and Paul one of the five is suspicious . I guess he never gave it a thought that they just might be followed by one of Mr Marcus 's admirers from the college ? At the hotel Paul calls them out and says You are n't Lorenzo Marcus are you ? ' To which Mr Marcus confesses that his real name is Loren but his friends call him 'Silvercloak ' Matt was a King of the Dwarves and they come from a place called Paras Dervalin another world where Ailell reigns . Yeah right ? ? I CERTAINLY would believe this guy that I have never met ! ! ! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS TRIPE ! ! ! ",0
"since writing this series in 1984.Fresh from reading the Lions of AlRassan pub . 1995 the Sarantine Mosaic pub . 1998 and the Last Light of the Sun pub . 2004 with their subtle plots and characters richly crafted world and religions I thought that Kay could do nothing wrong . Boy was I ever wrong.All the above qualities are glaringly absent here.Instead of subtle characters we have 5 heroes who constantly and at length reflect on their FEELINGS . Yet they manage to carry off all that tedious introspection without ever well coming to life . The contrast with George RR Martin or later Kay POV passages could not be more marked . For example if I was a Toronto college student suddenly lured on false premises into a deadly war I would be quite a bit more upset and concerned about my safety than these guys . Though maybe not quite as much as say a Thomas Covenant whose lengthy selfexaminations while repetitive also make a lot more sense.In later books Kay will sometimes end a chapter with something like And he suddenly realized what he had to do and leave you reflecting on which possible decision the protagonist will choose based on all the insight you have into his behavior and motivations.In Fionavar these cliffhangers happen much more frequently . Likely as not the protagonist will then for no reason at all based on no information known to the reader run off to a location not yet introduced to do something earthshaking entirely out of the blue . Perhaps the characters behave that way because they are destined to do so . The role of fate personified by the Tapestry becomes more pronounced in the concluding book of the trilogy . Yet that is a subtle point and hardly justifies the inane storywriting throughout.Fionavar itself has a cliche goodvsevil backstory inspired by Tolkien and Celtic legends . Geographically characters zoom off from one end to the other in hours by teleportation if necessary to further the plot . The result is that you it feels more like an adventure around a big citytheme park and its surroundings than a real world with real features and real people . The religious aspect involves various gods frequently interacting with mortals and Rakoth Maugrim the bad guy makes Sauron look like an in depth character study.Everything comes off as archetypical rather than realistic . That might have been the intent but did not make this series any more pleasurable for me . I really ca n't say that Kay should be ashamed of it because he has since matured into one of Fantasy 's best writers . But Fiorana was not a promising start by any means . And no books 2 and 3 are n't all that much better either . ",0

The author has obviously done his fair share of travelling and the settings and descriptions made me jealous that I was only reading about them and not actually there.The story is a fairly straight forward murdermystery and although it was a easy case to solve and I kept waiting for a twist that never came it was an entertaining read . Bravo ! ",3
"A cracking pace familiar likeable characters with dollops of humour and real life . There is a follow up novel Blood Price which is equally as good and features the same characters .

"The book is about a backpacker who finds a dead body on a trail in Nepal which has been mutilated in the same way his girlfriend was in Cameroon two years previously . Our hero sets out to find the killer . The book 's about much more than that however . It 's about recovering from the death of a loved one . It 's about backpacking and travelling around the world and needing to do so to the point where you only take jobs that will give you months of leave . It 's about the bursting of the Internet bubble . It 's about the concept of tribe a chosen family that is your support network no matter how far away they are . It 's about using the Internet to find people and track them down . And yeah there 's a cool mystery in there too . Evans captures the feeling of being on the edge of 30 and unwilling to buy into the twokidsandadog suburban lifestyle . ",4
"I was very disappointed with this book . The premise is good enough . There is a serial killer out there hunting down unsuspecting travelers . And since the murders occur away from the western world there is a tendency for the killer to get away with it . Sounds good enough right ? Well yes and no.The descriptions of life on the trail the attention to detail of life in the third world etc . is all done very well . It is obvious that the author has done his share of traveling . But when it comes to crafting a mystery novel once which keeps the reader guessing and wanting to read more the author falls short . The protagonist is able to 'solve ' the mystery of who the serial killer is in record time and he does so in an almost elementary fashion.If you are looking for a light read that captures what it is like to travel to third world countries then this book might interest you . But if you are looking for a mystery novel with lots of twists and turns you 're better off leaving this book on the shelf . ",2
"I REALLY LIKED THIS BOOK . COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER PROOFED FOR ERRORS BUT ALL IN ALL A VERY INTERESTING READ . ",3
"I 've spent many months over the years on the Banana Pancake trail hauling a backpack through Asia and elsewhere solo or with friends seeking the next thrill brooding over the meaning of it all and watching the world mutate around me . A lot of people who have done the same have speculated on how to process this experience into something like a novel and Evans does an admirable job turning the world backpack adventure into a decent murder mystery . While I ca n't say I enjoyed his writing style and found the dialogue at times pretty painful to read the overall experience was good and the plot kept me guessing until the end . ",2
"I was truly unprepared for this story ! If you want to step into a world on the edge here is a great read . ",3
"I purchased this book because it was a good price . I was not expecting it to be great but it was something good to read . ",2
"OH my gosh ! This book was amazing ! The author Jon Evans has given me so many new perspectives on things . Suddenly I just want to walk everywhere and go exploring ! Paul the main character loves to hikeor trek . He travels around the world to discover new places to climb and see . He meets wonderful people eats exciting foods and struggles with a past loss . The book becomes very mysterious and soon the reader is wrapped up in the Who Dunnit ? The ending is perfect and I will cherish this story forever . Thank you Jon Evans for showing me the other side of the world . ",4
"Dark Places Dark Places Of The Earth Kindle Edition by Jon Evans kept me hanging on . It was a good story not especially fast moving but with much about exotic places I had never heard of and some interesting characters that were developed nicely . And the story itself developed in a linear fashion . The protagonists were likable and as a mystery should one thing led to another and such . But and although I read the entire story it was ruined for me when something way beyond possible in my opinion occurred . After that the story proceeded reasonably well and I was determined to be happy with it but the unusual happened again . I do n't provide spoilers so I wo n't tell however I still enjoyed the read just not as much as I might have . ",2
"Invitation to the Game 0671866923I read this book as a little girl and spent the next ten years looking for it in book stores because it stuck with me so strongly.Invitation to the Game is in some ways standard science fiction fare the earth is overcrowded with unemployed people none of whom can find a job because robots can accomplish most tasks more cheaply and efficiently than humans can . When a group of young adults are dumped directly out of their high school graduation into the government run slums to enjoy their leisure years as unemployed adults they despair that they will ever be happy again . Their leisure years are anything but as they stave off simultaneously crippling boredom and the perils of extreme poverty in their Designated Area where gangs roam free at night and the other unemployed adults party themselves into an eternal stupor to dull the pain.When a mysterious organization offers the group a chance to participate in a virtual reality game for a mysterious prize they leap at the chance anxious to do anything to brighten their existence and bring meaning to their lives . Yet as the year goes by and their visits to the gaming center become more frequent they speculate as to the true motives of this organization and what the real meaning of The Game truly is.Invitation to the Game is a fascinating exploration of a future where inertia prevents the necessary changes to society that are so terribly needed and where brilliant young minds are in danger of being wasted in order to allow the system to continue unchallenged . This is not action scifi much of the book is devoted to daily scrounging and survival without the help of adults a sort of futuristicBoxcar Children if you will and to periods of discussion over the nature of society and their own uncertain fates and futures . Hughes does a remarkable job moving the story as a fast clip and her contrasting drab future society and vibrant virtual reality escape are wonders to behold.While the story sounds depressing and frightening the Hughes maintains a light touch providing nurturers among the group to act as a surrogate mother and father and the young adults are remarkably selfsufficient and dedicated teaching themselves karate and instituting a fun and healthy exercise regimen to protect themselves both within and without The Game . While their world has hardships and privations these are seen as challenges to be overcome rather than impossible burdens . While the individual members of this throwntogether group often do not get along they nevertheless learn to respect each other and they solve conflicts realistically . The end result is that the reader relishes in their small victories and the privations of the world around them only make the victories that much sweeter . And when the prize of The Game is revealed we see that the solution to their problems is both bittersweet and exquisite.~ Ana Mardoll ",4
"This book is an awesome survival story it really makes you think about what you would do if you had to survive in the wilderness . If you like this book I highly recommend Transall Saga for another SciFi Survival Book . ",4
"When I was in junior high and high school my favorite subgenre was the group of books where the story takes place after the Apocalypse after Earth has selfdestructed and people are beginning to rebuild . This story would fall into that category . Lisse has just graduated from school and is hoping to be placed in one of the few jobs available in the world but this does not happen . Instead she is sent to live with a group of other unemployed young people in an old building in the dying inner city . Then the group receives an invitation to the Game and everything changes . ",3
"I remember reading this book when I was 10 years oldAnd Im 27 nowAnd it was a really great bookI have been searching for this book for forever ! ! ! ",4
"This is such a good book . I do n't know what some people are talking about . If they did n't get something out of this book then they have n't lived . Really . One of the things Lisse goes through is the horrible pain you get from leaving something so good behind and then the joy you get from experiening something new . We 've all been through that at one time or another . I 'd recommend this for people of all ages even though it is written for a younger crowd . I would have also liked to see a little more with the character feelings and the such but this was written for younger kids and when I read it as a 6th grader the characters seemed real to me . Now 3 years later when I picked the book up at the library and read it in one sitting some of the characters are a little less real and alive but it means more to me.Okay I 've rambled long enough . Some of the people that wrote bad reviews really need to rethink what they 're saying . A piece of art is n't always 'good ' based on how much blood was spilled.Please keep readingany books . ",4
"I remeber reading this book several times between my 6th and 7th grade years I am now a Junior in College and having enjoyed it immenslely . There are indeed parts that make you raise your eyebrow however most of these can be overriden by an examination of timeperiod and environment that Hughes has placed her main characters in.A good piece of Sci Fi for those who are interested in it in that age category . ",3
"This is such an awesome book I bought it when it first came out remember those scholastic book orders ? And I loved it . I lent the copy to someone and I never saw it again . I bought it again as an adult and loved it finished it in one sitting and I recommend this for young adults and anyone older too a great read ! ! ! ",4
"This should be required reading in school . I mean it really gives a look into the future . We 're constantly trying to make our lives easier and get a computer and probably soon robots to do our jobs for us but what happens when there are no more jobs left for humans to do ? so many books have it like we 'd be living in luxury but would n't it make our lives more drab less meaning to them ? This book is fast paced with no dawdling . It makes you definitely think twice before wishing you did n't have to work . ",4
"Whenever I read this book I am reminded of the fact that short summaries even the back of the book itself simply do not do this story justice . It 's one of the few books that I would recommend without hesitation to be on a school 's reading curriculum since not only does it tell an engaging story about unemployed life in a dystopian future but it also has the thread of hope running through it that tells people that no matter what they have useful skills even if they do n't yet know what use those skills are.The story is told from the perspective of Lisse who has just graduated from school and found herself with no employment prospects . This is far from unusual as she came from one of the top schools in the country which had a 10 % job placement rate in a world essentially run by robots . Along with her friends from school Lisse starts out her new life as an unemployed.The world Hughes set up is an interesting one . Unemployed people are taken care of in a basic sense by the government given shelter and enough credits to buy food and cleaning supplies . Anything else they want they must get by scrounging materials from garbage cans anything throw away or to be recycled . They may not work except at indie things like selling art to the employed who have money to spare . They may not travel and they are limited to their Designated Area . Gangs essentially rule the streets the goverment 's first line of defense is the thought police and overcrowding is a major problem.Then when the tables turn and they find themselves in unfamiliar surroundings they are forced to exercise every one of their individual talents to the utmost in order to survive as a society . That in a nutshell is what this book is about . Society whether it be overcrowded and terrible or tiny and held together by only the bonds of friendship and necessity . What makes a society and what makes a good or bad society ? Monica Hughes is not afraid of asking the big questions nor of posing them to young people who most of us would deem incapable of truly understanding such broad concepts . Most adults could n't properly answer what makes a good or bad society after all and I enjoy coming across good YA novels that do n't dumb the issues down for children but instead present the questions in an entertaining and provocative way.And like Michael Grant 's Gone this book does n't flinch away from the fact that life involves death killing and other unpleasant things especially when one is in exceptional circumstances.I could read this book a hundred times over and never get bored of it . I highly recommend it to well just about anybody really be they young or old . It 's the kind of book that makes you want to think that makes you want to be productive and makes you examine yourself and your place in the world.I know I for one feel pretty confident that if I were in the same situation as Lisse all my friends would have plenty of clothes to wear . Most people would consider skills like making a drop spindle spinning yarn and knitting to be quaint hobbies at best in this modern world but when I read this novel it 's easy to remind myself that there are plenty of situations in which my quaint hobbies could be the difference between barely surviving the cold and being comfortable and warm.Read this book for yourself and then take an inventory of your skills . You 'll be surprised at what you do n't even know you know . ",4
"Ms. Hughes was one of my favorite authors as a young teen and even though as an older reader I 'd probably find the plots predictable and a little clich & eacute you have to start somewhere . This book involved a group of . . . I think it was ten or twelve . . . friends who had been together all through their education the way all groups are raised in this future society . This family unexpectedly is not assigned any sort of job even though they have the skills they should and did everything they were supposed to do . . . they do n't understand why they are n't being picked up by their society until they get an invitation to play a weird game where some kind of virtual reality has them playing a very realistic survival game . Why are they being asked to do this ? Are they being trained for something even more important than they thought ? ",3
"Fraser takes a break from the hilarious overthetop adventures of the Flashman series with this more sedate and gentle window into Edwardian England although it should be noted that a very aged Flashman does make several cameo appearances from time to time to deliver straight talk and pinch the serving wenches . The title character is Mark Franklin a former cowboy and outlaw he rode with Butch Cassidy & amp The Sundance Kid as part of The HoleintheWall Gang who struck it rich mining silver and is trying to become respectable . He 's moved to England in 1909 searching for his ancestral village in an attempt to find himself a place to call home . While he has various adventures both amorous and perilous the book is mostly an excuse for Fraser to take the reader on an extended tour of the Edwardian years which bridged the end of Victorian era sensibilities with the rise of the horrors of modern life exemplified by WWI . With his vast riches Franklin quickly makes an entree to the upper classes and unsurprisingly what he finds society to be mostly selfish shallow blind to reality and indifferent to morality This is in sharp contrast to other characters from middle and lower classes who embody more solid values and character and are competent productive members of society . Woven into the plot are such items as the Irish problem the suffragette movement and the buildup to WWI . As usual Fraser keeps things interesting with vivid characters and rapid pacing . Thankfully and pointedly the book ends as Britain mobilizes with appalling naivete for the war that would destroy a generation . ",4
"George MacDonald Fraser is one of my favorite authors . It used to be before Amazon that I would have to find his books in Canada or England if I happened to be there . Now of course he 's quite popular in this country . I love his Flashman series and they have accompanied me on many a vacation.Mr . American contains his usual historical accuracy though it 's not intended to be as funny as the Flashman series . Harry Flashman shows up though but in this book he is used to decry the folly of war in most of its forms certainly that of WWI.The title character is an American who becomes an observer of the decadence of post Victorian England as well as one welcomed into it as long as he is useful to those snobs whose society he is invited to enter . Whether he is to be amusing to King Edward or to use his money to restore his wife 's family fortunes he is brought into the swim only to find that it is a shallow pool indeed.But along the way he comes into contact with delightful and trustworthy characters none of whom are of the upper class and it is these characters who make the snobs by comparison seem so feckless . Pip is as wonderful as Samson is loyal and unperturbable . It is these characters and Prior and Thornhill whom we are able to compare and contrast with Percy the Claytons and those who surround the King . Pip like most people who are positive and seemingly without a care is in fact very ethical supportive of her family and without guile . The others in their own ways represent bedrock values and character quite a contrast to the carefree unethical and undignified society people.I highly recommend this book for its sheer pleasure of reading it .

"This is an interesting look at the clash of two worlds the old world of Edwardian England settled classridden and at the pinnicle of power and also weary cynical and snobbish . Into this new world comes a man from the New that world of frontier America rough and ready accustomed to lawlessness and violence and also a little naive . The Mr. American of the title has a mysterious past but sufficient money to set up in a country house to venture into that alien glamorous world which in the end may turn out to be as hazardous to him as anything he encountered in his old life.All this and Harry Flashman too what more can you ask ? ",4
"This is not a Flashman book although Flashy does make a couple of showings in the book and leaves a lively imprint . If one however wants to know what it was like to live during the High Noon of Edwardian England for an outsider.Then this is the book to go to . Frankly this book is well worth the money with its good solid writing and interesting historical facts presented ! Enjoy ! ",3
"Instead I recommend Fraser'sThe Complete McAuslanThe Pyrates A Swashbuckling Comic NovelQuartered Safe Out Here A Harrowing Tale of WWIIMr . American and Flashman # 1 are listless . It 's hard to believe that the same man wrote these books.My next Fraser will be 'The Reavers ' a comic novel of the Border Reivers loosely based on the Candlemass Road in the style of his earlier novel The Pyrates.And The 'Light 's on at Signpost ' a memoir of the author 's days writing in Hollywood interspersed with criticism of political correctness and New Labour .

"Mark Franklin once an outlaw had earned a fortune in the silver mines of Nevada but had always romanticized England because of the tales of his family 's descent from there and from images of the Shakespeare he loved . So with his fortune secure in 1909 he visits England to make his home in the small village his ancestors came from.He falls into aristocratic company and meets everyone from the King to Winston Churchill to Sir Harry Flashman . Though he meets his future wife in that society he eventually realizes that his wife is n't much better then the rest of the corrupt society . Having found little silver and much tarnish in England and with World War I drawing near he must decide should he stay or should he go ? And besides there 's always that outlaw past ready to try to bite him . . .Fascinating book as Fraser displays an intimate knowledge of that era . It was n't always that easy to understand Franklin 's motives and easy sometimes to laugh at his naivete but I guess I 'm not as straight a shooter as he was . My loss not his.Well worth reading though it bogs down just a little bit in the middle . ",3
"As a lover of the Harry Flashman books by Frazier I found Mr. American to be a bit of a disappointment . I guess I miss the romance and adventure not to mention the humor of his other novels . Nor does it have the zip found in Frazier 's nonfiction Quartered Safe Out Here . A nice enough read.END ",2
"This is a curious work . As expected George MacDonald Fraser 's writing is marvelous and his storytelling creative and brisk . The only thing is that except for one lifethreatening incident the novel is n't very eventful in the way we 're used to experiencing in novels . The protagonist an American prospector who has struck it rich decides to return to his family 's ancestral village in England to live and play the lord of the manor . He marries into an upperclass family hobknobs with the King and has some encounters with a suffragette a showgirl and a conniving aristocrat . For such a wealthy and masterful man he gets manipulated an awful lot by unscrupulous Old Worlders including his cheating wife his parasitical brotherinlaw and even the infamous General Flashman . The story is very interesting and I did find this 592 page novel quick and enjoyable reading but just not of such magnitude and import that one is used to seeing in a published novel especially by an author such as George MacDonald Fraser.Where I found the book most moving was in his theme of English roots and family and blood that could n't be broken even by oceans and centuries and which mysteriously brought an AngloSaxon American home to a place he had never been amidst the graves of his ancestors . In a similar vein when we are informed that old General Flashman a nonagenarian in 1914 had known a grandfather who had fought at the 1746 Battle of Culloden we are struck by the immediacy of history and our own presence in a chain that goes into the past and into the future . The evocation of the start of World War I so utterly devastating to England is portrayed in the heartbreaking dialogue of 3 working men whose mixture of romantic bravado and matteroffact determination so clearly showed their misapprehension of the carnage they were about to enter . This is a novel of transition for Mark Franklin and for England . Franklin 's adjustments to a foreign world are obvious . But we are also shown a rapidly changing England who was throwing off the last vestiges of the morals and mores of her greatest era an era that started with the downfall of Napoleon and which was bookended by the horror of the First World War . I suppose one could say that I found the background of more interest than the foreground . ",3
"It 's late summer 1909 in Liverpool and a Yank steps off the boat from America . Mark Franklin is an authentic Westerner his luggage containing Stetson saddle gun belt and two .44 Remington pistols.I 've been to England many times and I love it . Unfortunately my family 's roots are not in the UK nor have I had the longedfor opportunity to take up permanent residence there . In MR. AMERICAN it 's Franklin 's great good luck to have made a fortune from a Nevada silver mine . This allows him to return to England in search of his roots his forebears having immigrated to the Colonies hundreds of years before and purchase the house Manor Lancing which dominates the Lincolnshire village of his ancestors Castle Lancing.I learned in English Lit 1A that every novel incorporates a conflict which in MR. AMERICAN is subtle . To modern fiction readers fed a steady diet of lurid murdersmostfoul global conspiracies and courtroom duels it may not seem like much of a conflict at all . Author George MacDonald Fraser a Brit himself has chosen to introduce into Edwardian society of pre WWI England a rugged individualist matured in the late19th century American West and develop what happens . The WASP values that Franklin possesses from such a background chivalry selfreliance forthrightness loyalty lack of class pretension suspicion of authority are occasionally at odds with the upper class social circle that soon adopts him.For the reader Mark will present as an appealing standup fellow . The book is populated with interesting characters Samson Franklin 's gentleman 's gentleman Pip the effervescent West End stage actress King Edward VII Lady Helen Cessford the militant suffragette Peggy the daughter of an impoverished country squire Kid Curry the unwelcome visitor from Franklin 's um shall we say irregular past . And above all there 's the outrageous and aging rascal General Harry Flashman the hero of a whole other series of books by author Fraser.I was undecided for a bit on the number of stars to award this novel 3 or 4 . At almost 600 pages it is n't the type of book that keeps one riveted . The dramatic moments are occasional and of short duration and there are a lot of loose ends that would have made an absorbing sequel inasmuch as the storyline ends in 1914 with the outbreak of the war . Since MR. AMERICAN was published in 1981 no sequel has been written to my knowledge . Pity . In the final reckoning I gave it four stars because it 's about an American who finds home and adventure of sorts in a green and pleasant land . I 'm envious . ",3
"Mr American begins with the arrival of Mark Franklin in England . Mr. Franklin has spent his entire life in the American West . He has never been to England in his life but he 's finally come home.The author of the series George MacDonald Fraser has an extraordinary command of the English language and all it 's endless variations . Combine this with a knowledge of history that 's astounding in it 's depth and scholarship as shown in his Flashman Papers series and you 're in for treat . ",4
"After Black Ajax the idea of an essentially serious Fraser novel is a little less strange when this came out though it was viewed as a definite anomaly in the middle of the Flashman series . It 's an excellent grownup book that rings some interesting variations on classic western and innocentsabroad archetypes in some ways the answer to H.L . Mencken 's famous jest that Henry James could have been a really great writer if only he 'd gone west instead of east to Europe.The straightshootin ' excowboy at the center of Mr. American is for all his supposed outlaw background ultimately as much of an innocent as one of James ' flowery young debutantes . Having made his pile out west by means rough and tumble but less vicious than all the Londoners like to imagine he goes to Europe to find refinement culture and he imagines the decency that life out west lacked . Of course he finds the exact opposite in an Edwardian England that is morally rotten and on the verge of the greatest iniquity of all the mad selfdestruction of World War I. Fraser does a beautiful job of making Mr. American simple enough to be disillusioned yet not so naive as to be comical this is a fine intelligent read and though this is hardly the highest measure of a novel with its blend of John Ford and Merchant Ivory such perfect movie material that it 's hard to imagine why some aging star like Eastwood or Harrison Ford has n't snapped it up and won an Oscar with it . ",3
"Fraser of course is well known for the marvelous Flashman novels but he wrote other novels as well not to mention stage plays screenplays and critical works . This book runs to more than 550 pages but it breaks neatly into two halves so it 's almost like a leadin novel and a sequel the two sections differ in flavor too . It 's the summer of 1909 and Mark Franklin American disembarks from an ocean liner at Liverpool with very little to his name apparently except some rather old clothes a large quantity of cigars a pair of sixshooters and a fancy Mexican saddle . A day later he 's in London strolling the streets and drinking it all in . And very shortly after that following a runin with a militant suffragette and a much more pleasant encounter with a young actress in a musical revue he has purchased a modest manor house in Norfolk and is moving in . But as we eventually discover this was n't a spurofthemoment thing . Mr. Franklin as the author refers to him throughout the book descends from people who left the village of Castle Lancing in the 1640s to try their luck in the New World . Franklin himself son of an itinerant schoolmaster in the West never really had a home he worked as a ranch hand and miner until he struck it rich and now he 's come back to where he hopes his roots are . And he 's very very rich.He gradually fits himself into the life of the village though he 's still pretty much a loner and he takes on a manservant who steers him in the right directions as needed . And while out exploring the countryside one day he meets King Edward and his mistress Alice Keppel . Bertie rather takes to the American gentleman 's polite lack of forelocktugging and Franklin finds himself swept rather abruptly into the highest levels of society . He also meets Peggy daughter of a local baronet friendly but financially straitened falls in love and rather quickly marries her . Throughout all this Fraser shows us a vanished world through the eyes of an astute and observant outsider . And to act as his politically incorrect mouthpiece he brings in the now 90yearold retired Gen. Sir Harry Flashman who is also the greatuncle of the suffragette noted above who has caustic comments and observations of his own and who revels in creating discomfort among the movers and shakers.But there 's more because Franklin has another side to his past . He was also a satellite member of Butch Cassidy 's Wild Bunch gang involved in several holdups and shootings before he reformed and attempted to go straight . And all that comes home to roost when an extremely menacing figure from that darker past shows up on his doorstep one winter night.The second half of the story picks up a couple of years later early in 1913 with Mark and Peggy living in a nice townhouse in London visiting Castle Lancing at intervals and doing all the social things one expects . At least Peggy who is nearly fifteen years younger than her husband is immersed in the social whirl . Franklin himself is beginning to feel too old for that sort of thing but he 's involved in his fatherinlaw 's growing stud farm which he financed and keeps up with his young brotherinlaw whose military career in Ireland he subsidizes . Until his wife comes to him for a substantial amount of money and he gradually discovers all is not well in his life . Fraser then shows us the other side of British aristocratic society and its attitudes the side a Puritan Yankees is not going to approve of much . Though he 's far too canny an author to cast it all in blackandwhite . The last part of the narrative as Franklin tries to decide what to do whether to chuck it all or what and all of this against the background of the assassination at Sarajevo and the slow realization by the people around him that Britain is facing its first real war in a century is almost Shakespearean in its tragic inevitability.Fraser likes to do extended setpiece scenes and there are a number of those often centering on Gen. Flashman but also including a nice courtroom interlude and a fancydress ball . My favorite character unquestionably is Pip the jubilant talented showgirl who does n't pretend to be anything she 's not she 's the most centered person in the story . Franklin himself while one of the Good Guys still is rather a cold fish and not always easy to empathize with . But the dialogue and descriptions the historical scenery and psychological exploration are quite superior . Too bad more of Flashman 's fans have n't discovered this book . ",3
"Some years before the beginning of World War One Mr Franklin arrives in England carrying two Remington revolvers and a bank draft worth a fortune.Fraser uses this auspicious beginning to give us a view of Edwardian society from top to bottom its highs and lows its glories and its hypocrisies.Mr Franklin has come to England to seek out the village from which his ancestors had emigrated in the 17th Century and to settle there if ha has any expectations at all it is that he will live a quiet life in a small sleepy village . Of course this is not what happens and thereby hang four stars worth of reading enjoyment.From his accidental but most enjoyable encounter with London showgirl Pip to his accidental but portentous encounter with a distinguished gentleman in the country who despite his incognito has a rather royal manner through his brushes with Fraser 's charming rotter the elderly but still randy Harry Flashman the young Churchill runs a bit shy of Sir Harry and a hairraising reminder of his past in America Mr Franklin takes it all in stride with a slightly bewildered interestIt takes love to disturb him sufficiently that he will take decisive action.An action that will be silhouetted against the backdrop of the beginning of World War One and its time.This is not the rollicking romp that the Flashman books are nor is it the cheerful sometimes touching military fiction of The General Danced at Dawn and Fraser 's other Dand McNeill stories But it is a picture of a fascinating time and place that seems so recent in some ways and so long ago in others a picture that helps to open and illuminate that time and place for the modern reader as slowly but surely it slips from living memory into recent history about which if as has been said the past is a different country one can say that recent history is a foreign contry that lies just outside our own borders.And as when one visits such deceptively familiar but ultimately foreign places one is advised to engage the services of a reliable native guide and translator to get the maximum enjoyment out of your visit . Accept Mr Fraser 's offer to act in that capacity and travel back to that time ",3
"I found the pace a little strange for a while . A very pleasant unhurried book . Do n't read it if you 're in a rush or expecting a thriller.As far as I 'm concerned this book is important for the last appearance of Sir Harry Flashman and if only for that read it.I actually did n't get the ending at all but with such a book it really does n't matter .

"England . 1909 . Mark Franklin the American has stepped off the Mauretania to his new life in England after striking it rich on a silver mine in wild untamed Nevada . He 's returned to what he perceives to be his ancestral home three hundred years after his longdead ancestor left it for America to begin with . What will he find ? How will he adapt ? Thus begins this lengthy engrossing dreamy tale of this bygone era and this wonderful bygone place which was to end abruptly in a mere five years never to return again . But what a place ! Decadent gawdy bustling London with its shops and restaurants and newsboys and cabsboth motorized and horsedrawnand trains and theatres and pubs and bobbies and pickpockets . There is no more exciting city on earth . But the countryside is charming as well . For the upper class in their estates surrounded by wellmanicured parkland pheasant hunting picnics and fox hunting during the day dinners smoking gambling and boozing at night . And although the life of the working class was not quite the same it was by no means a wretched existence . One had the means after all to visit the theatre or perhaps attend a bawdy musical revue or maybe just have a pint or two at the Apple Tree.Like any other time in history though there were issues . Women did not have the vote yet and many in the community were becoming restive over this . The Irish problem was also heating up with the Dublin government threateningby force if necessaryto incorporate the northern counties . And as time went by developments over central Europe began to loom unpleasantly . Everybody had an opinion about everything.It is just marvelously evoked and nothing is missing . And unlike many other novels of this typeCrimson Petal and the White comes to mindthe hundreds of tiny details and the descriptions of people and places never overwhelm the story . They are there to create a setting not to show the reader that the author is so vastly knowledgeable.Along with the fascinating period detail there is alsoas one would expect with Frasera terrific plot . Obviously there are no Charges of the Light Brigade or Custer 's Last Stands or Sepoy Mutiniesactions commonplace in the Flashman novelsbut the force of Fraser 's narrative is such that even little things such as a game of bridge can become incredibly suspenseful.Our friend Mr. Franklinbarely in England for two weeksunwittingly comes upon a picnicking King Edward and before he has a chance to think about it he is invited to dinner at the estate at which the king is visiting . What a complicated venture ! How should he act ? What should he wear ? What should he bring ? Should he bring a gift ? He somehow manages to get through dinner but later he is asked to play bridgea game he barely knowsat the king 's table and it suddenly occurs to him that there is a tremendous amount of anxiety in the room . You see everyone and especially the hosts are desperate that the petulant king enjoy himself and remain in an agreeable mood . For the king to depart his hosts in a foul moodand to then regale other members of the nobility with tales of woe regarding his stay with themwould be a terrible black eye and perhaps something they could not live down . And now it is Mr. Franklin 's turn to bid with the king eyeing him carefully from across the table and with the king 's mistress prattling disarmingly to his left while she surreptitiously counts every card.And later after purchasing and renovating his own estate after becoming a thorough English gentleman and after becoming irrevocably involved with the English gentry he gets a surprise visit from an old American acquaintance . A Mr. Curry . A harmless enough looking fellow Mr. Curry is in fact a notorious murderer with a very quick gun . He also has some knowledge of Mr. Franklin 's past in the badlands of America a past that Mr. Franklin has not completely divulged to his new English friends . Mr. Curry believes he is entitled to a significant amount of Mr. Franklin 's fortune and he is there to collect.There is quite a bit more . Indeed never is there a time during the course of the novel that one feels entirely complacent about setting it down . Surely another twenty minutes are n't going to harm anything right ? But in fact it does slow somewhat towards the end . Mr. Franklin has become slightly disenchanted with the English and with his new English family forgetting perhaps that they are human after all . The war has just begun . Attempting to get across town with the inestimable Flashmanwho makes a couple of delightful appearances in thisthey get stuck at the palace . Thousands of loyal Britons have congregated singing Rule Brittania and other patriotic songs and the sound is deafening . As Flashman exits the carriage to go to the palacehe is there only to relieve himselfthe crowd recognizes the bemedaled old hero and cheers Hip hip hooray hip hip hooray over and over again in an everincreasing deafening roar . It is to say the least a very moving scene knowing as the reader does how Great Britain is going to be affected by this terrible conflict.The blurb on the cover of the paperback edition of this is from the Times and it says Every page is sheer unadulterated pleasure . There is really no better way to describe this wonderful novel . ",4
"Let me say first off that I hated this book . I have n't read a book in a very long time that annoyed me as much as this did.The main problem was its protagonist the titular hero the Mr. American . In the description given of the story he is drawn as some kind of Gary Cooper strong silent type who is calm and measured on the surface but deadly when riled . In the early parts of the book I kept seeing Gary Cooper and seeing the story itself as some kind of early 30s movie.But as the story evolves the guy turns out to be a colossal wimp torn hitherandyon by every one of the sophisticated jaded and cynical old world characters he confronts . He is beaten at every game robbed and led around by the nose by his beautiful but contemptible and worthless wife who has married him just for his money . Worse he is indecisive and even when his life is put in peril in a confrontation with an old enemy he relies on his British valet to get him out of it . At the end of the storyand this may give something awaywhen he has finally made a strong decision to leave his miserable marriage at the last minute he gives in and crawls back to the worthless harridan he has been thoroughly abused and cheated by . Hardly the stuff of heroism and silent strength.Worse this book came across to me as an American as an example of the most obnoxious type of British selfsatisfaction selfcongratulation and indulgent condescension . The device of setting a foreigner down in your country and seeing through his eyes the perfection and wonders of the country is difficult to stomach . One example our protagonist is from the American West the twofisted twogunned heman I described above . He is constantly reassured and constantly thinks to himself about the efficiency and genius of the British police system where no man can commit a crime and escape where one can not indulge in the Western type of slaughter and get away with it . When he himself in selfdefense commits murder he deigns it better to conceal the action rather than face the police with the truth so deep is his fear of the coppers . Again not the hard man of decision we were promised . Yet our author seems to forget that just a few years before this story is supposed to take place in Britain the most famous of uncaught criminals was openly and brazenly committing foul and very gaudy and public murder in the streets of the empire 's capital city and mocking those same brilliant efficient police for their inability to catch him ! The plot ends up being a rehash of a story stereotype that was already old when this story was supposed to be taking place that of the goshgolly nave American amongst the sharps and wolves of degenerate Europe . This type of story has merit and possibilities even today if its done as humor and satire but not in an adventure tale where the hero should at least at some time stand up strongly rather than be a complete puss from beginning to end . In a lot of ways this came across to me as a Jeeves & Wooster story but without the laughs and cleverness and sly social commentary that give this type of story some merit.I give it two stars instead of one for the following reasons First it is very well written . The author is an excellent and smooth writer . Unfortunately in this novel at least the story is n't worth the talent and I think it 's a misfire . I 'll have to try out a couple of his other books before I make any judgement on his place in fiction . They are probably better and maybe he was on unfamiliar ground here.Second his history is excellent . Some timesa lot of timesyou get a better idea of history by reading fiction than you do by reading straight history . He seems to have all his facts right here he drops in a lot of telling details of the times the social movements the drift of Britain and Europe towards war and the ultimate destruction of the society portrayed here . This is what kept me reading when I wanted to abandon the book and is its strongest suit . When the novel started going back to the story and characters is when it lost me but I persevered doggedly to its confusing and highly unsatisfying conclusion.So would I recommend it ? Yes to British readers of a Kiplingesque jingo mindset if they want to relive days of glory long gone by . But as an American I found it insulting in the worst waythe author feels an admiration and affection for us but it is the type of pat the dog on the head type of affection or maybe more precisely the type of affection a master felt for his slaves in this country in the days of the old South my darkeys I love them so they sing so sweet and are as dumb and gentle as children . And if you are of an Irish Nationalist bent it is even worse and more insulting . It 's too bad because the idea was good the writing is excellent it is just poorly executed . ",1
"I 've read all of Fraser 's books and I consider this one of the best . I just reread it after a gap of 8 years . I enjoyed it immensely . It should be read by all fans of Flash Harry . ",4
"This is a great book particularly if you are an Americanlive in England and are a closet wild west buff.I enjoyed every page of this book . ",4
"Call this book a prologue.The first chapter setup is simple Morn Hyland beautiful damsel in distress is rescued from evil disreputable smugglerpirate Angus Thermopyle by dashing hero Nick Succerso . But that 's not The REAL Story . What REALLY happened is much more interesting.The first and shortest book in the Gap series focuses on The Real Story . Donaldson has a lot of fun twisting expectations and unpeeling layers . It makes for a good book but not a great one . The more important function of The Real Story is to get you ready for The BETTER Story which is The Gap Cycle.I believe Donaldson is one of the best worldbuilders out there . If you 've read the incredible Chronicles of Thomas Covenant you 'll know what I 'm talking about . This is what he is best at and I believe his writing fades a bit when he writes character studies . The world of The Gap Cycle is compelling and in its own way enchanting but you do n't get to see a lot of it in this book . Donaldson is setting up some concepts Gap Drive Forbidden Space Piracy and why it thrives but most of this book is a character study of the vile Angus and the newly orphaned Morn . There are huge scads of this book that are dialog free Donaldson is doing a lot of telling and not much showing.And some of it is quite brutal . In his afterword in my edition of this book Donaldson admits that he thought for a long time before publishing the story because he did n't like to think about what people might think of him . While I 'm glad he published it the nastiness does go over the top in places and seems a bit gratuitous . I believe that following a lessismore strategy and allowing our own nightmares to fill in the blanks would have been more effective.But who am I to presume to tell SRD to write ? I 'm just glad he did . Stick with this book because the next one is much better.The Gap Series has everything you could want in a Space Opera . Pick it up.The Gap SeriesThe Real Story B+Forbidden Knowledge A+A Dark And Hungry God Arises AChaos and Order A+This Day All Gods Die A+ ",3
"Many of the reviews on this book complain that it is too cynical . I find this to be a ridiculous criticism of a book . This is the same sort of nonsensical flagellating that Thomas Hardy once said cured him of novelwriting Hardy certainly being accused of among other things too cynical.But I 'm not out to write a review of other reviews but of this book . Donaldson 's universe is not as deep or compelling as say Margaret Weis & amp Tracy Hickman 's Starshield Universe or their delightful spaceoperatic setting of the Star of the Guardians trilogy or even the relatively sparse celestial settings of some of Harlan Ellison 's scifi work . I do n't think by this point in the series Donaldson is working on sweeping us away in typical spaceopera grandiosity be forewarned if this is what you seek you will not find a classically defined epic in this story.What you will find is a compact tightly written and disturbingly personal piece of fiction . If you 're an empathetic person you 'll be able to relate to even the monstrous Angus is some detached way . There are no heroes in this story and if you consider it no true villains . The story is about a kidnapping but the simplicity ends there.Yet I have to admit I would have preferred the epic scifi sweep of the aforementioned authors in places opposed to the personal introspective and often slowpaced tone of this novel . Give it a try it only takes you about 4 hours to read . ",3

"I have read several reviews here which described disappointment at this book and its subject matter . This is the first book in a five part series and is the shortest of the bunch.While it is an important starting point after having read it you will not have any inkling as to what comes next ! In fact the rest of the series goes in such an unexpected direction that you can not judge the entire story by this novel alone.This novel can be ugly and even disturbing as we see the complete victimization of the heroine . I can understand how some people can be turned off to the series but if you make the effort to read this novel you must read the next novel in the series to get a better understanding of what you are in for . If you stick with what you read I think you will be pleasantly surprised . ",3
"This was not what I expected a sorta soft porn adventure soap opera among the stars . In this case the science fiction is only a backdrop to the real book a study in characters . A dark and dreary mood permeates this story and the following ones . Sure you do n't want a steady diet but for a change of paceI loved Morn and in a perverse way came to feel something for Angus . Their relationship was more than masterslave involving a deeply disturbing complexity . Actually I had no trouble getting through the book although I admit that the following works were better . ",3
"One policewoman two pirates.A space policewoman with a serious flaw she gets sick during the type of travel required to cross interstellar distances gets into trouble when the destroyer she serves on runs into a ruthless pirate.Enter another more dashing far less ugly pirate into a bleak story of capture and survival along with the beginnings of a nasty alien plot . ",2
"As a fan of Donaldson 's fantasy novels I was disappointed when he turned to science fiction a genre I 've not often liked as much . I finally began to miss the guy after almost ten years . This first book was a rough ride considering all the ugliness but I fell in love with his writing style all over again and persevered to find all the wonders held in the sequels . 'The Real Story ' is exactly that stark realism gritty and in your face . The advantage for the reader is the pleasure of seeing characters who rising from their latest beating to perform a feat of determination to survive extraordinary under normal circumstances are made all the more admirable given these I hope you follow that ! Donaldson absolutely shines at writing himself into and back out of corners when you 'd think there 's no way out for him and it is all totally believable.I 'd rank this series on par with his other work and wo n't be nearly so reluctant to follow him into whatever genre he chooses to pursue next . ",3
"Angus Thermopyle is truly vile . Revolting worthless and at his core evil in the most contemptible ways . Science Fiction needs many more heroes like him.We have many admirable SciFi heroes . But we meet Angus as a monster and his ruination and redemption IS an epic . No apologies to Wagner required.Sure we love David Weber 's Honor Harrington . But characters like her can not fail they can not fall . Their souls are never in jeopardy . When Angus begins to even HAVE a soul it is a fragile precious thing . It 's survival is always in doubt even past the end of the work.If this book was boring stupid or poorly written then there would be no excuse for the long slog through the filth and gore that this book chronicles . But it is expertly crafted brilliant and riveting.There is much more to love and hate about this book but it certainly deserves to be very widely read . ",4
"I read this book and ONLY this book out of this series . It was subpar so I did n't buy the rest . This book ends like a movie serial . I loved The Unbeliever series and expected more from The Real Story.I sit here and read reviews of all the Gap books but the reality is that this one is badly written . Perhaps the series is good but I will never know because I disliked the writing style the simplistic story and the pulp ending of the first installment . If an author writes a bad novel do they REALLY deserve to get more of your money ? In this case I did n't invest another dollar in the rest of the Gap books because the first was not very good . I recommend you do the same . The Gap gets 2 . ",1
"I 've got to review the entire series because there is no standalone story in this cycle which begins with 1991 's The Real Story The Gap Into Conflict . If you 're in for a penny you 're in for a pound . And if you 're in prepare to be assaulted . Donaldson 's penchant for making his protagonists suffer and wringing every ounce of blood sweat and tears out of their endless distresses is both bracing and punishing . With a sprawling narrative mirroring Wagner 's Ring Cycle Donaldson builds a vast roaring space opera like no other wherein victims victimizers and saviors change places people get mutated into aliens and the only promise is that even if things turn out well they will do so bloodily after much suffering has been endured . Science fiction authors are rarely this visceral rarely create such fascinating damaged characters and rarely manage to make their interstellar fateofhumanity melodramas as personal or powerful . If you 're in the mood for sci fi with the sweep of Star Wars but the emotional nakedness of James Jones look no further than the Gap Cycle . ",4
"This series is a straightforward space opera interplanetary traders pirates space police icky aliens with a nod to high operaWagner 's Ring des Nibelungen cycle to be precise . Unfortunately Donaldson whose writing sparkles here as it has in his other books particularly the first Thomas Covenant series has latched on to a genre that is stale and leavens it with touches that are creepy at best and at work downright unpleasant.This volume which is the best in the series follows the misadventures of a young space cadet named Morn Hyland . She 's a junior pilot on a huge familyowned freighter . When her ship comes out of 'the Gap ' read warplightspeedwhatever everyone on the ship but her is killed . A piratescavenger named Angus Thermopyle a sleezeball of the first order take her aboard has his way with her and is eventually arrested when he pulls in to a space station for repairs . That 's the Real Story . or is it ? Donaldson plays a Rashomonlike game going back and retelling the story in greater depth more close to the character 's point of view revealing that what really happened may have been something quite different . We get to watch Morn raped and degraded . And Morn raped and degraded . And Morn raped and degraded . Angus displays all sorts of neurotic soul so we 're supposed to come to sympathise with himthat we almost do is a tribute to Donaldson 's writing skills which is why I even give The Real Story 2 starsbut the fact of the matter is that this is a book about abusing a woman who never appears as more than a victim or a cypher . I read somewhere that Donaldson wrote this series during and immediately following his divorce . If so I feel his pain but I really would rather that I had n't read the book . I went on to read the rest of the series waiting for some kind of redemption but aside from the fun of identifying characters from the Ring cycle in various spacers and magnates it 's more scenes of Morn being raped and degraded literally or figuratively.As science fiction it 's stale as softcore S & ampM porn a genre I must admit to being much less well read in it 's flat . For either go elsewhere . ",1
"Sure I had read other science fictionAsimov Bear Quite a few unknowns and Names I Ca n't Remember but nothing prepared me for this book . I came into it off the Thomas Covenant series trusting that since it was Donaldson it would probably be at least an ok read and besides its short . If I do n't like it I do n't have to read the others.What I found when I opened the book was a drama of such depth and with so many realistic characters that it changed my views on science fiction . The bleakness of the rape scenes and the depravity served as an excellent counterpoint to the characters ' struggle to survive . You can only have as much good in a book as you admit bad . This book has a lot of bad but it only serves to make the characters ' simplest actions heroic in proportion . Morn 's struggle to survive in the face of all that happens to her is heartbreaking it shows both the strengths and the weaknesses inherent in human nature . Overcoming those weaknesses and the depravities that are forced upon her is a seemingly impossible task and so every score in her favor means so much more than it would if she was merely kidnapped and yelled at . The other characters are equally depthy but that depth is developed more over the rest of the series . I even found myself sympathizing with the characters on the dark side of the spectrum although I would never agree with their actions . These characters are not inherently evil they were twisted by their childhood by the events that surrounded them . This can never make their actions forgivable in any society but it can convert anger at them into sadness for them . If you read the first book and never pick up the second you will be losing one of the best if not the best scifi series out there and also one of the best reflections on the nature of the human soul . The ideas expressed are not pretty if they were they would not be an accurate reflection of reality . Give it a chance . ",4
"This is the first of five books centering around three central characters each balanced and very well developed with serious weaknesses as all of Donaldson 's characters seem to have . At times you might find yourself sympathizing for the antagonist and feeling unsure of who you want to root for . While each book is separate on its own and each has a prologue summarizing prior books like Covenant it is best treated as a single story.There is sexual content in the series that some may find offensive especially in the first book . It definitely adds to the story and the emotional ride Donaldson delivers . If you read the Thomas Covenant series you know how his books sometimes make you feel like you were run over by a MackTruck and this series will definitely do that to you but there are highs as well as lows compared to Covenant which was mostly depressing to me.The story line of the series is fascinating much like Strachzynski 's Babylon 5 series the characters are greatly influenced by political events maneuvered like pawns until they move in unexpected manners . The first book is a quickie more of an introduction to the series . As the series progresses it becomes increasingly complicated in a delicious way . It 's not hardcore scifi in that the technology is not the focus of the story it could take place in submarines or pirate ships in the ocean almost as easily.I enjoyed this series a lot more than The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant . Another good read by Donaldson is his collection of short stories Daughter of the Regal which I 'd highly recommend . ",4
"Despite Stephen Donaldson 's admitted writing talents complemented with inventive and original concepts the content of his work has progressively and dramatically declined since the writing of the classic fantasy sextet The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant almost two decades ago . Followed by the good but unmemorable fantasy Mirror of Her Dreams with the Gap series he has chosen to turn his talents instead to science fiction . It is hardly a success.I forced myself to read both the first and second books in this series mainly I suppose out of loyalty to the memory of the earlier Covenant series . However whereas there the protagonist possessed a dark side that enriched as well as leavened the realism and humanity of the tale in the Gap Donaldson has chosen to revel in the singular immorality and depravity of his characters . The end result is an unrelentingly dark world totally devoid of humanity or an inkling of compassion with protagonists obsessed solely with their own selfish purpose . There is a determined absence of the interplay between the potential for both good and evil that coexists in all humanity . Instead the world of the Gap is devoted to characters pathologically oblivious to anything outside their own primitive survival and more often than not perverse desires . There is not a single sympathetic character to which one can attach much response beyond disgust . While it is obvious from reading other reviews that Donaldson has found an audience for this work his creation here reflects a unremitting cynicism and misanthropy that while I recognize its existence in the world I would prefer not to dwell in entirely . And this book is too preoccupied and singleminded in it 's desire to explore the depths of human depravity for me to applaud the quality of it 's writing . Conceptually without merit and one of the least engaging works I have read in some time . ",1
"I did not find the story interesting at all . The book was recommended to me by a friend whose recommendations I will not take anymore . ",0
"I will try the next book in the series based on reviews but this one was just too much for me . I could n't get past the rape stuff ",1
"This is my second time reading this story and it still holds up well . The first time I read it I was blown away by the brutality of the story and frankly embarrassed to say I enjoyed the story . The second time through it did n't appall me as much but then again I knew what I was getting into . This is typical Donaldson he explores the darkness of the human soul and can put human despair down on paper better than any author out there and it 's in full display here.Anyway this is the first book in his scifi GAP series that sets the stage and introduces the triangle of characters Angus Thermopyle the ore pirate Morn Hyland the police officer and the ore pirate Nick Succorso . The story is interesting in that it starts with the end of the story but then fades back to the start and tells the real story of what happened . It 's hard to say anything without giving it away but it focuses on Angus and Morn and how he comes to capture her and break her but as shown in the first few pages we know that Nick somehow gets involved too in his lust for Morn . To tell you the truth there 's not much to the story beyond that and the fact that these three characters get developed through the story.This book is n't a happy one it 's dark sexual and violent and it will put off some readers . You could almost say this is scifi horror but the horror is human and not supernatural . I think this it is an interesting tale told well and introduces us to a new world built by Donaldson . Personally I love this story and enjoyed it the second time around.Of note it 's a short read as it 's not a very large novel . ",3
"This is pretty cheesy and salacious . Not worth spending the time . I gave up after a halfdozen chapters . Its not so much a science fiction novel as it is about exploitation of females . Do n't waste your time . ",1
"Like all of Donaldson 's books this one disturbed me the first time I read it . The main character was about as vile as anything I had ever considered as a teenager . And the conclusion was unsatisfying to say the least . But no other players were named . No background or history was given . This story was all about a terrible human being and getting the reader to want to know what happens to him.It worked.At no point during The Real Story did i want him to succeed but I absolutely had to know what happened next . Which meant I had to slog through Forbidden Knowledge where Donaldson gives us all of the relevant yet dull background for the story . If you can make it through the last two books are amazing . ",3
"There is n't so much to tell about this first book of Donaldon 's Gap series . It 's neither bad nor spectacular and I wouldnt be suprised if quite some readers would be deterred by 'The Real Story ' from reading more novels of this series . But dont be too badly surprised and just consider this book as an extended prologue to the great scifi epic coming up in the next four books . 'The Real Story ' itself is about Ensign Morn Hyland who is captured by the pirate space captain Angus Thermopyle after her space ship got destroyed by the raider . Angus not only forces Morn to crew for him he also succeeds in putting some kind of mind control on her which he exploits at a very disturing rate . At this point readers who are more familiar with Donaldson 's works might see parallels to other heroines of Donaldson i.e . Lena in Lord Foul 's bane and is it just me or does he have a warped approach to female willingness for sacrifice or what ? Anyhow when Morn finally sees a chance to get herself rid of Angus she teams up with swashbuckling space captain Nick Succorso and together they plot to bring Angus down.Basically 'The Real Story ' just serves as introduction of these three leading characters and to link them together . As the series progresses and the stories behind the curtains unfold much more details about the main characters on one side and the forces behind the scene on the other side are revealed . With each book Donaldson 's plot becomes more spectacular and complicated and his style of narration is grim and pretty much in your face but whatever you say of Donaldson geeze he knows how to bring his books and his series to some breathtaking culmination . 'The Real Story ' just isnt one of those books rather some prelude to some epic of a much wider scale . ",2
"I read this book because I was told of how disturbing it was . My thinking was that anything that could inspire such revulsion in hardcore readers must be worth a look if nothing else than to see what the fuss was about . Besides that I heard it was a decent story.My hope is that the remainder of the series is stronger . The story itself was marginally interesting but there was really no likable character to root for . Even Morn was hard for me to embrace . As to the vile acts committed in the book yes they are somewhat unsettling . However the acts here did not disturb me as much as say the rape scene in Burgess ' A Clockwork Orange . There are numerous mentions of deviant behavior but they are described in a detached unemotional sense and without any detail so they really failed to impact me . Maybe I 'm jaded but I was not really that shocked.Donaldson is a good storyteller and builds characters well . My hope is that in the next book have not read it yet Morn and her new captain will be developed more fully and challenged to do more . ",2
"Great read loved the whole series . I had 3 of them and was so happy to obtain this first book and the fourth book of 5 . Best Science fiction Iread in a long time . ",4
"but also an extremely well written beginning to an excellent series . Make no mistake this book is not for the fainthearted . There are scenes in here that 'll make the blood boil and the stomach turn . And most of the book deals with the relationship if you can call it that between Angus Thermopyle and Morn Hyland with Morn acting as little more than a toy of Angus who gets most of the character development . Donaldson takes us deep into the recesses Thermopyle 's twisted soul and makes the reader wallow with Morn in those festering sewers . This is actually necessary to understand her motivations later in the series since The Real Story is mostly setup for what follows later.Really it 's wellwritten stuff that stays with you long after you put the book down whether you want it to or not . If you can get through it it 's worth the read . But make sure you continue the series . But if you 're looking for an uplifting mindexpanding story with a happy ending look somewhere else . ",3
"I 'm embarrassed to admit I read this . So why am I confessing ? Maybe it 's good therapy . Unbelievable characters . Trite dialog . Flat out stupid plot . And the worst thing is the 4 book series that this begins is n't so much a series of 4 books but 1 big lame book split into 4 installments . A real series would have distinct stories a beginning and an end with some sense of completion to each . This reads like a TV miniseries complete with a cliffhanger at the end of each night 's episode.So if I hated it so much why 2 stars instead of 1 ? Somehow the author managed to trick me into reading every book . I got to the end of the first and thought oh that was awful I have to read the next one.Take my advice and avoid this like crack it 's easier never to start than to try to stop . ",1
"Then there 's a quite ridiculous pretentious afterward where the author tells of his struggle to achieve aesthetic perfection with this book and compares himself to Richard Wagner.All of this is made profound by the author telling us that the victim is really the rescuer and the rescuer is really the villain and the villain is really the victim and hip bone 's connected to the thigh bone and theA piece of depth psychology maybe if I rape somebody often enough she 'll fall in love with me . I paraphrase but only to improve the grammar.If you like extreme sexual psychopathology stick with The End of Alice . Space jockeys would do better to reread their Heinlein . ",0
"I guess I should give this five stars since there 's no other way to write something like this really and it 's an important setup for the story ahead . This book is brutal disturbing and short if it was n't short it would be impossible to finish . I take a star off for initial editorial censorship'fornication ' for the first half of the book before leaving the word behind and saying what he means.The Real Story although written as a standalone novella serves nothing more than the purpose of setting up the characters of Angus Thermopyle Morn Hyland and Nick Succorso and gives frame of reference to events later referenced as minor parts of larger plot devices simply for anchoring.The Real Story eliminates the strained suspension of disbelief for Morn Hyland in particular . She is believably mentally sharp but not so much given her obvious mental issues this pushandpull provides no offenses of sensibilities once you 've read The Real Story.The Real Story is a horrible story as it stands . It can not stand on its own . It is the most disturbing unsatisfying thing you could possibly read . Donaldson himself admits this and admits that he had written it as a standalone originally and was not satisfied . It exists instead solely to establish facts and an empathy for characters that follow in the remainder of The Gap Cycle and it satisfies that need extremely well.A word of caution The Audiobook is narrated by Scott Brick who reads everything in the lighthearted tone often used with Shakespearean literatureand to the same effect as dark a story is you ca n't help but imagine faeries and unicorns prancing about and smiles on everyone 's faces as they drink their milk and honey . No stars for the onedimensional narrator . ",3
"I had a hard time reading this . Stopped and started reading this several times . The brutality against the woman is difficult . Then you get past that and the story gets going . Then it 's enjoyable to read and sets up for the next book . ",3
"When most fiction writers approach issues of rape and abuse they quite sensibly tend to imply acts of violation rather than indulge the fantasies of the darker side of the male psyche with extensive and prurient descriptions of acts explicit violence . In 'The Real Story ' I feel that Donaldson has overstepped his mark and might as well have included detailed closeup colour photographs depicting rape if immersion in appalling and repeated acts of sex crimes was the effect he wished to achieve . I guess most testosterone driven men including myself have a darker side to their psyches but we recognize the barbarism our impulses and divert and suppress them for shame we refuse to indulge the beast within.Donaldson expresses some agreement with this viewpoint but in his Afterword he says It was as if in imagining him The chief rapist KR I 'd tapped directly into the dark side of my own nature . He also states that If I drew on some buried part of myself to create Angus so much the better at least I 'm writing what I know . Mr. Donaldson you far overestimate the value of visualising and verbalising the savage instincts of the beast at the heart of man . You merely give voice to protoman stripped of all restriction civility and culture to the inchoate lust of the beast.The result of your lapse Mr. Donaldson is a ghastly expression of voyeurism focused entirely on the continuous degradation and humiliation of a human being in a manner all to commonin today 's world . I do not find this acceptable entertainment but rather quite simply as rapepornography.Before the hackles of some of my readers rise to risible conspicuousness I would add that I am not advocating censorship actually I quite enjoy good quality erotica in all its forms . But this book should carry an age restriction and a pornography label in my opinion.Nevertheless Donaldson is an immensely talented writer and I quite enjoyed the story overall . He really has tried hard maybe too hard to reflect the elastic multilevel dichotomies that exist in every human psyche through the vehicle of his three main characters.I feel that he could have turned this into a masterpiece had he reflected a little longer on the dominance of his tale by a focused fascination with rape as a means of breaking the human spirit and rewritten it .

"Nothing compares with Donaldson 's first two Thomas Covenant Trilogies . But this story is surprising good given that the main character Angus Thermopyle is quite repugnant . Somehow despite this the story kept my interest and I am now well into the second book in this series . ",4
"I read the first Thomas Covenant books and thought they were ok . So I thought I 'd give these a try . I gave up midway through the second book . Just did n't have enough action . According to some of the reviews the action was just about to begin . Is that true ? Did I give up too soon ? ",0
"I too gave this novel a chance because I loved the Covenant books . In that series Donaldson broke ground going completely against type and gave us one of the first modern antiheroes of FantasySF . In the Gap series he breaks new ground again by starting with a story we think we know then takes it in a completely different direction . The book starts with a simple spaceopera then flips the stage around and shows us what 's going on behind the sets.This book is sort of a gimmick to get you hooked . Judging by some of the other reviews his gamble in The Real Story did n't pay off for some . That 's unfortunate because many have passed on what many others have found to be a rewarding reading experience.If you love Covenant give the Gap a second look . If you love Ben Bova Hyperion C.S . Friedman this series is right up your alley . ",3
"Read this ! Very well written . I bought the second in the series after reading this one . And the third one as well . ",4
"This is my favorite seriesI read it every year . Much darker than what I normally read I seem to always return to it when I need a reminder that my life is n't so bad . This first book is a bit 2 dimensionaland not the real story . You do n't get that til the next book ! ",4
"I have read this story just by chance mention of the book and then writers reputation and I have to say I 'm glad I did . I have been looking for adult scifi for some time and this absolutely fits the bill . Not only is it of mature nature but the character building the plot I know it 's a series is fantastic . In addition the writer knows how to WRITE ! I 'm now on the second book and loving every minute of it looking forward to reading the other three . If you are an adult and wants something with some bite in it give this a series a try . ",4
"I picked up this book not because I was a fan of Donaldson 's Thomas Covenant series I was n't but because the controversy shrouding the book intrigued me not to mention the fact that I 'm a fan on the genre . Upon completion of the book I was more impressed than I thought I 'd be though I hope the series picks up after The Real Story.The book almost exclusively revolves around two characters the sadistic pirate Angus and helpless excop Morn with Nick a pirate possibly as devious yet infinitely more charismatic than Angus making appearances here and there . These three characters form a classic victimizervictimrescuer trio though they switch roles somewhat throughout the plot . I thought this a fairly interesting concept though executed poorlytoo much of the book focused on Angus and the atrocities he inflicted upon Morn . The majority of The Real Story was from Angus 's point of view establishing him as a diabolic yet cowardly captor Morn his anguished captive.I wanted to keep reading only to learn about Nick the third main character that is n't a main character . Hopefully he 'll be more developed in the forthcoming books.As for the brutality that 's getting so much attention it was n't nearly as bad as I 'd imagined it 'd beDonaldson did more telling than showing as one reviewer mentioned . While this is generally a big nono in professional writing it spares us readers the really graphic descriptions . The infamous rape scenes are generally composed of a sentence from Angus 's point of view neglecting to delve into the agony it must have been for Morn.All in all a decent if overly simple introduction to the series . I just hope the sequels are more encompassingi.e . more than two characters every hundred pages . ",2
"After some time laboring in the halls of fantasy Donaldson decided to try his hand at some good ol ' fashioned spaceship infested sciencefiction envisioning a five book series that is thematically based on of all things Wagner 's The Ring Cycle which does speak to some degree of ambition . Unfortunately there 's a thin line between ambition and pretension . Sometimes they go hand in hand and things still work out okay anyway and some times the latter utterly obliterates any benefit the former can cause . In the first volume that winds up being more the case.He does a bold move in the early portions of the book essentially sketching out the plot of the book in the first chapter in skeletal form . Bearer of awesome name Angus Thermopyle walks into a bar with attractive but docile looker Morn Hyland for reasons that we are n't entirely sure of . They are witnessed but somewhat scarred but equally attractive Nick Succoroso who decides that he have the girl . A distress call goes out both ships leave both come back at different times and Angus winds up getting arrested and Morn winds up in Nick 's company . The End.But we 're told that 's not the real story.Um as it turns out it actually is . The rest of the book spends its time fleshing out that basic scenario and filling in the details but while the book hints that we 're in for our entire world to be turned upside down because nothing is as it seems it turns out that matters are almost nearly exactly what they seem or just make sense with some explanation . In his first appearance Angus comes across as a mean and nasty hardened son of a gun while Morn seems a bit beaten down like she 's been physically and emotionally dominated and sure enough that 's pretty much deadon . The book keeps trying to insist to us that we 're not seeing the full picture but really we are which is the part that strikes me as unbearably pretentious at times like all of this surely must mean more than it actually does . And maybe it will because we have four books to go but right now it 's a hard sell to get us to overtly care about any of this.It could actually be the short space adventure novella that the surface of it suggests if not for the fact that Donaldson wound up crafting Thermopyle as a thoroughly unpleasant character to the point where it almost becomes ridiculous like he 's trying to prove to us how much of a hardcase he is . He 's the character we spend the majority of time with in the book and the one who rescues Morn when her ship gets destroyed . However there is very little redeeming about him at all and while Donaldson seems to suggest in the afterword that he was hesitant writing the character because people would assume they were reading about his real dark side and be disgusted with him . But instead it seems at times more like a little kid trying to push us to see how far we 'll let him take this before throwing the book across the room like some kind of game of who can blink first . A large chunk of the book and the part that will probably turn off most people is Angus ' treatment of Morn . To control her since during gapsickness basically something people can randomly develop due to hyperlight transit she tends to try to destroy the ship she 's on he implants an illegal zonecontrol to keep her from doing anything he does n't want her to do then proceeds to beat and rape her almost nonstop.I 've had certain reservations with Donaldson 's fictional views on sexual relations before as opposed to his actual views which I know nothing about and are probably quite benign . . . Mordant 's Need showed a squirming onesided aspect to it that was almost embarrassing and he certainly has n't learned to be more nuanced in the years since . Angus cuts Morn giant slices of rape pie almost constantly and has his way with her over and over again taking all the stuff that Eremus promised Terisa in Mordant 's Need and bringing it to violent life . It 's degrading to her and seems to serve no purpose in the story other than to make us feel bad for her through the cliche of a suffering woman with the rather unpleasant implication that the suffering might somehow make her a better person . It 's clearly designed to shock us but all the attempts to leaven Angus ' character by showing that a maybe he 's not all bad aw he loves his ship ! or b degrading Morn is slowly perhaps changing him aw he sometimes cries after he 's done hitting her in the face maybe he secretly hates himself ! are just awkward . Why ca n't he have the man being on the receiving end of the forced sexual domination for once ? It 's starting to become a trend.It does n't help that beyond the plot there 's almost nothing else to latch onto other than the settings . Angus as I said is the character we spend most of our time with but he 's generally onedimensional as we 're told over and over again how mean and nasty he is how evil he is and he alternates between thinking about how awesomely nasty he is how he 's going to break Morn or just howling with rage any time he 's angry which is all the time . Morn more or less exists as a punching bag and while she elicits sympathy because most people do n't want to see someone else be beaten and raped it 's not that I care about her specifically being traumatized I just do n't like seeing people in general being treated that way . Beyond her treatment in the novel I could n't tell you three other things about her . And Nick remains an utter cipher the third weak leg to the triangle that is supposed to be the start of something epic but comes across as more along the lines of Krazy Kat in its variations as two men fight over a woman without actually fighting over her and who would rather be with anyone but the two of them.The setting more or less redeems the whole affair Donaldson 's sketched out SF universe has a lot of room for exploration and the political maneuvering has potential . But it seems he was so in love with what the concept could do or so in love with being shocking and not that I 'm bragging but I 've read worse that he forgot to work on the rest of the plot beyond the basics of it . If not for the afterword where he talks about his conceptual plans for the series and lengthening the book by twenty pages there would be little reason to recommend this to anyone at all except as an exercise in watching someone indulging themselves in all the nasty dirty things that society finds wrong and then turning around and claiming that we 're not seeing it for what it really is . Right . The rest of the series seems well regarded so maybe we can chalk to this up to a misfire at the starting gate and hope that he recovers for book two . ",4
"Ah a kind of book which perks my interest short violent and juicy.The story writing is original taking the reader from the simplistic setting of a story on through all the details nittygritty at times and takes the reader to the same conclusion as was in the short simplistic version.The characters are very distasteful drawing me into the story . I like to have characters with flaws big gapping flaws which are probed painfully again and again . Perfect happy characters bite . The Real Story while short wo n't let a reader down if you 're interested in the above . ",3
"I picked up the Gap series on a recommendation from a friend with the promise that it gets better sometime around book two . However this is book one and if i 'd have bought this and read it before deciding to go on with the series it would 've been a tough choice.To start with the plot is fairly good . It involves a few chapters at the start recounting what happens over a certain time period from an outsiders perspective then gets into the story itself mainly from the perspective of one character . The story is mostly told in third person subjective the only exceptions being third person omniscient as the narrator takes over.The characters did n't quite do much for me . They 're well drawn and realistic they 're intriguing but they 're also at this point at least not very likeable . This is understandable given the nature of the characters but even people we consider undesirable have things we like about them . There 's an exception to this with one of the main characters who is caught up in a situation that is frankly horrific . But we do n't get all that much from their perspective.Another problem for me is my perception of a detachment from the characters thoughts and their situations . Maybe this will resolve and I could explain it better with a second reading but I felt that in getting inside the characters heads Donaldson detached them a bit too much from their relationships with other characters and it all felt far too passive . I do n't know it could just be a problem with me having just finished three other books predominantly told in first person.Other than that the story was intriguing enough . All in all i 'm left neutral . But then again i 've often felt the same about most series that I think are wonderful.35 ",2
"If you are in any way squemish The Gap Series is not for you . There are no shining heroes like Luke Skywalker or Han Solo . This is a painfully real and vivid portrayal of the darkest side of human nature . Take a journey into a world full of rape betrayal murder deceit genocide political intrigues and finally redemption . Probably the best scifi series ever written . Satanically good . ",4
"This book offers nothing new to those who enjoy Science Fiction . It 's so lightweight that it almost defies gravity . The plot is tissue paper thin and the characterisation is very sketchy . It reads like a poor 1950s pulp novel and the ending is flatter than week old beer . I 'm surprised that Dondaldson managed to pad this material out to a thin book . For good space opera see early Niven or Haldeman . ",0
"One way to distinguish between good and bad authors is to examine the breadth of their career . Lesser authors often do one thing and then repeat themselves endlessly . Truly great authors take on a variety of projects challenging themselves by seeking out new stories . Like most people I was first introduced to Stephen R. Donaldson by the first Thomas Covenant trilogy and I sort of expected The Real Story to be something similar only this time in a science fiction setting . Was I ever proven wrong . This little novel is a completely different animal one that tackles different issues than the Thomas Covenant books and uses different strategies.The story takes place at some point in the future in DelSec a region of space where police hired by the United Mining Company exercise only limited control . The events described on the jacket cover all take place within the first few pages the majority of the book is spent returning and going over those events once again from the perspective of one character thus letting us actually understand motivations and details . One notable aspect of the story is the incredibly fast pacing with at least one new twist arriving every ten pages . In contrast to the Covenant series The Real Story uses direct and unsophisticated language quite appropriate for the direct and intense emotions that dominate the story.Character of course is at the heart of any great novel . Friends have complained that they ca n't understand the behavior of Donaldson 's characters and the above Publisher 's Weekly review insists that they act irrationally . They 're right . Real human beings needless to say are irrational and frequently difficult to understand . Donaldson has obviously studied our species carefully and noted the ways in which guilt and fear play out inside people 's heads . There are occasions in The Real Story where characters act counterintuitively just as in real life but there 's always an explanation for it if you look carefully enough.I can not crown The Real Story as the greatest science fiction novel of all time . It has some odd lapses in common sense . For instance one character sneaks into an enemy spaceship from the outside . Has this futuristic society somehow forgotten the concept of locked doors ? More significantly it fails to build up that amazing force that you find at the endings of each book in the Covenant trilogy and it is n't as compulsively readable . However I can still recommend this book highly and praise the authors for trying his hardest to break free from conventions in a world where clich & eacute and formula often rule the day . ",3
"Can Mr. Donaldson write ? Yes ! Is this a good book or good start to a series ? No ! or at least Not for me . It reads like some guy 's rape fantasy and our heroine remains surprisingly unsympathetic . Throughout the novel she 's portrayed as psychologically damaged with good reason and weak No heroism no nobility no ferocious strength you do not root for her or any other of the main characters . After she accidentally kills her entire loving family and then is repeatedly brutalized and raped by a fugly sociopath our heroine 's reaction is to manipulate another jerk but a hot one with her sexuality her primary motivation and state throughout the novel is fear often weepy fear . As a female I could not relate i.e . where was the burning rage and absolute hunger for vengeance ? Or if not the rambette route how about cunning & intelligence with some strategic or poetic justice ? I wanted to admire Morn or someone but there is nothing here . ",1
"This is the beginning of a new series by Donaldson and without the draggy feel of Thomas Covenant . It has a good solid science fiction feel to it not fantasy passing itself off as SF as is so common these days . Donaldson focuses on the dark characters and inner turmoils of mentally damaged people and they 're all damaged in some way . Well done this feels like the beginning of a great new series . ",4
"I do not understand how people identify with a protaganist who beats rapes drugs rapes kills rapes rapes rapes rapes . I do not understand it . I was locked into this by sheer morbid fascination . Let 's review.Protaganist is like the good guy and stuff . Angus is SUPPOSEDLY our protaganist . Angus rapes our female lead several times.Donaldson moved up from Thomas Covenant . Covenant only rapes once.Sick book . If I could give it a negative 5 I would . ",0
"As a Thomas Covenant and a SF fan I picked this book up to see what Donaldson had to offer this genre . Frankly the first word that comes to my mind when writing this is open sewer . A wellcrafted sewer but one nonetheless.What is most vivid and overwhelming for me in my memory of this book the depravity and sickness at the root of the characterdriven conflict . One main character is Angus Thermopyle a space pirate who captures enslaves brutally rapes and humiliates the book 's female protagonist Morn Hyland . Regrettably this is not a brieflynoted backstory . Morn 's struggle to survive life in Angus 's hands is a substantial portion of the book with each subsequent degradation described in sick detail by Donaldson.While I am thoroughly familiar with the concept of an antihero and realistic gritty fiction this book crossed my personal line . While it has more redeeming value than say a Tom Green movie the structure is nicely done characterization is vivid I feel like I am already familiar with the depths of depravity to which humans can descend . I 'm willing to traverse those depths if the payoff is great art but this book does n't reach high enough to justify getting my mind dirty . There are better ways to spend your limited reading time . ",1
"In the Afterword of this book the author Donaldson himself admits that The Real Story is n't one of his better efforts . It was originally meant to be a standalone novella and then Donaldson later decided to incorporate it into the Gap series that he was starting . The resulting revisions to the novella compromised its quality.Although the book reads quickly and is quite a page turner the plot lacks sophistication and depth and the characters are quite undeveloped and their motives unclear . Many questions remain unanswered by the end and on top of the general dissatisfaction caused by this the tone of the book is quite negative with plenty of violence and rape gracing its pages.However I have good news . There is an astonishingly stark improvement in the quality of the writingplotcharacterization from the first to the second book . I 'm now midway through the third and absolutely ca n't put it down.It is not really necessary to read The Real Story before reading the second book Forbidden Knowledge and in fact I 'm inclined to suggest skipping it as much of the background is retold in the latter . However it does read quickly and does shed more light on Morn Hyland 's strange affinity for Angus Thermopyle despite her utter revulsion of him.So far about halfway through this series seems to me to be a MUST READ for scifi fans everywhere . I hesitate at this point to put it on the level of Asimov 's epic Foundation series with its brilliant plot twists but it has a shot at getting there . ",2
"He struck me as a not very personable guyhe seemed bored as hell with the whole gig . But my copy of his first Thomas Covenant trilogy still has his signature . Buton to the main topic . This book and its four sequels depict man 's spacefaring future the way the X Files depicts the nearfuture FBI . There 's nothing in this series suggestive of man 's outgrowing his presentday character flaws like you 'd find in Heinlein Asimov Star Wars or Star Trek . Instead you find the galaxy under the thumb of a huge mining company and its tame police . To paraphase the old Tennessee Ernie Ford song humanity in this series owes more than it 's soul to the company sto'.There are no heroes herethe best you get to oppose the bad guys are these dysfunctional cases . Like a young policewoman who 'd be a great hero by virtue of her sense of right and wrong were it not for the fact that she spends most of the time getting victimized . Even her bosses hang her out to dry . I tell you if they ever make a movie of any of this series Lifetime will have as much of a claim on broadcast rights as the Sci Fi Channel.. But you know now i think I understand Donaldson better . He 's a bona fide iconoclastmaybe he finds ordinary sci fi too goodygoody . This is one very gifted writer but from him you do n't get The Jetsons . More like what if Nietzsche wrote fiction . ",3
"Donaldson says two interesting things about this bookOne is that it 's based on the Ring Cycle . Knowing that makes it a better read these are n't human beings running around in space rather they 're heroes and gods disguised as humans . And some of the gods take a long long view even if it means sacrificing themselves.The second is his distinction between melodramathe interaction between villain victim and heroand drama where hero villian and victim change roles . When the victim takes charge of her own life and becomes the hero you have real drama and in the Gap series every major character is alternately villain victim and hero to almost every other character.This can be hard to bear . The first bookThe Real Storytakes a simple onepage space opera tale which was printed as an ad for the book and tells it twice more in more detail each time showing that the notion of hero and villain is not simple and may be completely inaccurate . This book stands on its own without the next four but they add to it immeasurably.Over the next four books these same three roles drift believably between the three extremely damaged people from The Real Storythe dour antisocial pirate Angus Thermopyle the dashingly heroic pirate Nick Succorso and his loyal crew and poor Morn Hyland the innocent and beautiful space cop caught between them.The gods of the storyback at Earth and spacestations around it instead of in Valhallawatch these three torment and save one another as they line up their own conflicts using all three with the same ruthlesness gods always seem to.It 's a classic story told well . The space opera adaptation sits very nicely and the god characters the UCMP executives planning to arrest rescue or kill the three main heroes at various times work especially well given their source material.This series has a much cleaner writing style than Donaldson 's fantasy . Almost breezy at times which does n't make the contentviolence more often emotional than physical rape of bodies and minds and casual corruption of society and spiritsany more palatable.My girlfriend called this series books about what it means to be human . That says it all right there the good and the bad . ",4
"The Real Story is frankly a disappointing start from a master storyteller like Donaldson . Maybe it took him one book to get out the kinks of switching from fantasy to SciFi ? This is a real departure from Donaldson 's earlier work although he keeps his focus on the darker impulses of humanity that marked his Covenant series.However the book is still enjoyable and more importantly it introduces the sweeping Gap epic . This is the only series that I have read where the sequels are far superior to the original . The other Gap books keep getting better and better leading up to a very satisfying climax in fact taken as a whole the Gap series is one of the most original and thoughtprovoking scifi works in years.One annoying part of The Real Story is that it includes a lot of horrific brutality and torture but it is required to set up the transcendent transformations in the following books in the seriesSo my recommendation is read it with low expectations and then get on with the sequels ! ",2
"Most of the crowd at Mallorys Bar & Sleep over in Delta Sector had no idea what was really going on . As far as they were concerned it was just another example of animal passion men and women driven together by lust the kind of thing everybody understood or at least dreamed about . The only uncommon feature was that in this case the passion included some common sense . Only a few people knew there was more to it.That of course was not the real story . p. 16The Real Story opens by giving us the general view of what happened between two space pirates over a woman . What we see is bland and predictable . It is not of course what really happened . Next we 're shown the experts ' point of view those same events probing deeper beneath the surface . That is not the whole picture either however . Finally we 're shown the real story played out scene by agonizing and unilluminated scene and we come to understand the intricacies of Donaldson 's creation.Donaldson 's central conceit is to begin with a classic AntagonistVictimRescuer triangle and turn it on his head with Donaldson saying as much in the afterwordMy original intentions were explicitly archetypical . What I had in mind was an aesthetically perfect variation on the basic threesided story the story in which a victim Morn a Villain Angus and a Rescuer Nick all change rolesVictimized by Angus Morn is recued by Nick but that of course is not the real story . The real story has to do with the way in which Nick becomes Angus 's victimizer and Morn becomes Angus 's rescuer . p. 224225In this Donaldson moves with power and subtlety . From the opening Angus Thermopyle seems a standard villain vain greedy run down powerful and all but cackling . As the narrative progresses however we come to truly understand though still revile him . Morn Hyland 's character on the other hand does n't become deeper but rather shallower in devastating heart wrenching and drawn out torments . The final member of our subverted triangle Nick is viewed only on the periphery for most of the story but he is handled as well as the other two.There are two main problems with The Real Story however . The first of them is the sheer grimness of Donaldson 's vision . Now I like dark fiction . I think that imply what it may about my psyche the most interesting stories are the ones that hurt the most that make us reel back and try to shy away . In The Real Story Donaldson has plenty of that . What he has absolutely none of however is contrast . There are no and I mean that quite literally uplifting moments in The Real Story . None.This is n't a black and white drama but I 'm not sure if it 's necessarily more complex . We are n't talking about that new fad of gray versus black . This is n't even gray versus gray . The Real Story is full on black versus black pitch battling midnight with an isthatblackorjustareallyreallydarkgray watching from the sidelines . If black and white morality can be criticized for taking the human element out and exculpating the characters from all meaningful moral choices this is the same . By painting everyone in an equally despicable light Donaldson shirks away from any real moral dilemmas to the same degree no longer a battle between Rand and the Dark One it 's just the Dark One squaring off with Sauron innocent slaughtering sadistic misogynistic pirate versus innocent slaughtering sadistic misogynistic pirate.The other major problem with The Real Story results from the interesting opening and increasingly deep conceptions of just what happened . Now I think that the structure of the book was extremely well done and I was curious as to just how certain events played out when everything began but the real story turns out to be far too similar to the experts ' conception of it . Yes over the two hundred pages of narrative we get more motivations some events that those experts did n't imagine etc but on the whole our initial grasp of what happened is pretty much sufficient to extract all suspense from the story turning nail biting fight scenes into yeah I know how this ends . Can we speed things up a tad ? The Real Story set out with a very specific concept in mind and succeeded perfectly in its aim . Unfortunately its narrow focus led to a whole host of other problems and I 'm unsure if that one success really justifies the flaws of the story . I suppose that this volume 's worthiness will really depend on the strengths of its sequels . On its own however I 'd only advise checking out The Real Story if the concept is something you feel you need to read . ",1
"I was surprised at all the rave reviews of this book . I 'm a huge fan of Donaldson not only from his Tomas Covenant books but from his much lighter Mordant 's Need books.His first go at science fiction was a sight to behold an ugly and disgusting world where everything makes you wretch and everyone is your enemy . All of the characters have huge flaws and proceed along paths that I ca n't imagine any sane person taking . I hated everyone in the book and felt sorry for them at the same time . I could n't read any more . If that 's what Donaldson was attempting I applaud him but I wo n't read any more of these books . ",2
"This book starts in a manner which is rare within any novel it summarizes the entire story in a span of less than three pages . Then Donaldson informs the reader that is not the real story . The second chapter goes into more detail of what observers of those engaged in the adventures assumed had occurred but again Donaldson informs the reader once again that there is another real story . The third chapter finally starts into the real story.I was hooked by this simple segue into telling a story . And I actually enjoyed 'getting to know ' the characters and characters they are characters I enjoy getting to know at a distance but not really up close and personal.Overall this book was okay . But in reading the author 's afterword which I recommend for anyone picking this book up he explains how this book serves more as an introduction to these characters whom the reader will get to know much more extensively in the books which follow . On that level it seems to be an excellent book if you look at it from that angle . Even so it still felt slightly anticlimactic to me.I do feel that Donaldson at least in Angus ' case chose to use the character 's sexuality to expose the character 's depravity . There were several passages which made me really question if that was the best route to take in revealing how messed up Angus was . It just made it really hard to enjoy the story.Do I recommend it ? Not really . If you want to read the rest of the books in the series it probably is the best place to start within the series regrettably so . ",1
"Even when you know how things will end who will live and who will die you still enjoy the story . It 's like viewing a good movie several times . In this case there is even more wild intrigue and fastpaced action . Morn survives of course the battles on the ship between the travelers are great frenetic activity . In the end there was no big mystery nothing really happened in a spectacular way . The series did not exactly end with a whimper but instead a long low sigh from the depths of space . ",3
"But the best sleep aid I 've ever found . After reading the reviews I thought I 'd really like this book . But the plot development is glacial the character 's so pendantic that out of sheer determination I finished the book and find the obvious ending that bad guy Holt dies and Angus kills him and the world is saved and Morn gets a medal and a pardon no ca n't make this bad stuff up.My advice . If you are interested in this bloated book read every 20th page . I kidyounot that you miss nothing other than time wasted from your life.Obviously the author was paid by the word . If one would suffice twenty were used.Do NOT buy this book unless you have no imagination and have eons of time to kill in worthless pursuit of entertainment.If I could rate this book a zero I wouldI HATED THIS BOOK !

"Warden 's machinations really need to work.On board ship Angus is injured Morn has to try and hold things together complete with another couple of characters to add to the mix and being this series it is guaranteed some of them ca n't be trusted.Throw in some more space police to help out and a confrontion with the aliens that now can not be avoided as Dios has manoeuvred all his pieces as best he can.3 out of 5 ",2
"The last book in The Gap Cycle series . This is an outstanding series of books . Highly recommended ! I 'm going to read this last one again ! ",4
"This is the final book in the gap sequence . I wont bother to go into the plot in too much detail . Suffice to say the elaborate story developed in the preceeding books finally got wrapped with in an ending that although somewhat obvious was satisfying to me.I thought in the previous books the author was trying too hard with the 3way conflict between Morn Nick and Angus . With one of them out of the way in this story I think the writing stopped being so contrived as it was in the preceeding books.I just find that Donaldson can sometimes have an annoying style of writing and wont someone please buy him a thesaurus ? The number of times he used the word 'doom ' really got irritating . I also found it a little bit silly that the 'super light proton cannon ' could destroy Suka Bator seemingly instantly in fact the whole planet faced ruin but in the previous book the crew of Trumpet were able to hide behind an asteroid to prevent getting hit by it . Not to mention that if it was so easy for Calm Horizons to get within range why did n't the Amnion simply fly a couple of their behemothclass ships within range and wipe out humanity easily ? So the plot had some big holes in it but like any good story teller Donaldson was able to keep the story ticking along quick enough to distract from the plot holes . I think the weakness of the previous books was you just never knew which character to 'go for ' or at least have empathy with . Finally it was Angus who I was kind of cheering on despite his character being one of the most vile ever in the first and second books . That in itself makes the Gap Series quite unique in any books i 've read before.It was a real hard slog to get through all of these books and to be honest I wont be repeating the experience any time soon . The other books especially were quite tedious . But this is a fairly satisfying conclusion to the series so I give it 4 stars . ",3
"I have read this series many many years ago but it still stays with me after all that time . It is because unlike most SF the protagonists are not good strong or nice but mean selfish weak or a combination of those traits . This makes for some tough reading particularly the first book . To be honest I found the first book The Real Story at times repulsive but read it anyway until the end which was real good . That inspired me to read the next and the reading became faster and better.The story develops more intricate plots and deeper characters and the repulsiveness of the first book is not repeated but used as a backdrop for mutual relations . Well considered.So if you can sit through the first book you will read the rest and thoroughly enjoy the last one ! ",4
"When I started reading the series I was wary . Various people warned me of the brutality I would encounter . Thus I read out of curiosity . After finishing book one I decided that I had encountered neither the brutality nor the intricate characters or plot I had expected.However I plowed forward . As the books went on the characters gained depth the plot twisted and grew more precarious and I started taking sides.By the time I reached this final book of the saga I was fully hooked and rightly so . Donaldson ties it all together in the final volume . The intrigue unwinds with a domino effect and plays itself out quite nicely . Further although many plots and subplots reach fruition he does not insult the reader by leaving us with a happy world with carefree characters . This is as it should be a series about a period in time not a novel claiming to encompass all relavant times.I would recommend that readers not stop with the first book of the series or even the second . Keep reading and you will understand the politics at work which makes this final book all the more satisfying . ",4
"This series is alright and has some interesting enough subjects but you could condense the whole series from 5 to 2 books if you drop the constant What just happened Davies ? and then a rehash of everything that we all just read about . Unfortunately then Angus walks in and they have to explain the whole thing over again . Mr. Donaldson a suggestionWhat just happened Davies ? Morn turned with a sigh and explained all that had just occured in the control room . ",2
"In 'The Real Story ' Donaldson ruminates on how he permuted Wagner 's 'Ring ' into what would become this series . All through the books I was anxiosuly awaiting to see how it would wind up . I was considerably worried in the inbetweener books if I see another analysis of what the hell happened on the illegal station again I 'll barf . However in this book we are not bored to tears and the intrigue is actually exciting and interesting . My doubts were turned to admiration as i closed the last page after reading extracts from Hashi 's diaries I could appreciate the title even more . Now I think I 'm going to curl up wiht my bilingual copy of the ring and the elder edda . ",3
"It was n't quite the massacre I was expecting.Given the levels of brutality we had experienced in earlier books some warranted some not so much I fully anticipated the series to climax in a grand orgy of violence the likes of which we had never even imagined . Strangely though what we get is almost calm in a way.For those who have been following along all the threads finally come to a head as the ship containing Morn and Davies and Angus and company finally reaches Earth having picked up a few more people along the way just in time to realize that the Amnion have arrived there ahead of them and ready to shoot anything that wo n't agree to their terms . Meanwhile Warden Dios and his various directors attempt to pull all the pieces together of their plan to take down UMC CEO Holt Fasner and release the grip that he has on humanity.Pretty much if you made it this far the last volume gives you more of what you might expect . There 's no dip in quality but things do n't get remarkably better either . Donaldson writes suspenseful space situations quite well and for the most part the constant shifting back and forth between perspectives helps bring the pacing to something resembling a fever pitch . The thing is the main characters still are n't that interesting . What I found fascinating was how much more interesting everyone else other than Morn and Angus and Davies was where I wanted to read more about what was going on with Dios and his directors and all the political maneuvering as opposed to Morn once again being all angsty or Donaldson 's continuing attempts to redeem Angus as some kind of hero . Reading about Min Donner holding down the fort on the ship both against Morn 's band of misfits and stalling for time against the council winds up being a far more interesting experience topped only by Hashi Lebwohl struggling to find evidence to connect the kaze attacks with Holt Fasner 's orders . Lebwohl winds up being the breakout character in the series to me starting out as someone who was being sneaky for the sake of being sneaky and turning into a morally ambiguous man in service to the truth and acting on it because he respects Warden Dios so much.And it is the politics that make the series only because it makes the stakes seem so much higher . Donaldson does manage to give a visceral thrill to scenes of the council arguing with the directors stalling for time and holding off the attempts by Fasner 's puppets to hijack the whole affair and when the victory does come down it not only feels earned but feels earned through a team effort as opposed to one person being heroic . In comparison the scenes in space just pale with the Amnion threatening without actually doing anything beyond that at least nothing that ca n't be undone easily . . . and it is mildly disappointing that for all the fear about being mutated we just see one person turned into an Amnion in the entire series and everyone working through their various issues ad nauseum until you 're just begging for something to blow up.Which ultimately remains a problem that the series just ca n't overcome exciting as it is . Do n't get me wrong it 's a pageturner watching all the various plottings come together but there 's really nothing in here that will stick and move the soul the way the best epics do . The threat of Holt Fasner never seems to be as frightening or massively monstrous as the other characters seem to believe he screams a lot and is clearly mean but otherwise seems like a general megalomaniac with mortality issues and thus it becomes hard to believe that all the brutality and death over the last five books was warranted or justified in Warden Dios ' defense he does admit the situation got a bit away from him so it winds up being a lot of fuss for very little reason . The Amnion wind up being a much more frightening threat in theory but it turns out that their bag of tricks is fairly limited and once they run through those they do n't have much else . You reach a point about halfway through the book where it seems obvious that the good guys are going to win it just becomes a matter of how and who is going to survive . And the answer surprisingly is nearly everyone.The book is also hamstrung by the problem from the last novel where the multiple viewpoints require characters to repeat information that we just learned from the last chapter . . . good if you 're reading the book over a long period of time and need to be reminded about what happened bad otherwise . In fact it sucks a little bit of the suspense out of the climaxes as events have been put into motion for so long that watching them unfold is just a matter of seeing things done in the right order.But its the repetition in general that sinks the series a few notches below classic and into merely good as I said earlier the characters tend have their pet issues and those often get repeated in lieu of actual characterization . Thus five books in we 're still getting Angus moping over the fact that he was tortured as a child for what reason ? who knows ? Morn angsting over pretty much everything her family dying Angus you name it and that 's not even counting the various illegals and minor characters who get the same treatment . There 's a stock sense that they do n't get developed past a certain point unless the plot requires it until the plot is over and it does n't really need them anymore . Morn 's struggles and losses do n't come across as deeply felt where I 'm actively rooting for her nor is she so dynamic that it 's believable that Angus would start to change his personality because she was nice to him . It does n't sink the series as far as I originally expected it would mostly because the plotting and the political stuff livens up the action but the series ultimately remains an exciting if somewhat empty experience in being epic and proving that doing the right thing is a good idea where the stakes do n't truly seem to justify the means . It 's telling that after spending five books and thousands of pages with them the characters are comfortable to me but never become anything more than slightly familiar strangers . Its clever in its construction but all the structuring and allusions seems to have lost sight of where the heart should go . ",4
"This Day All Gods Die is the final novel in the gap series . Does it satisfy ? Well that depends on what you like . Donaldson brings his multiple plots and plot threads together quite well drawing everything to a close . However the pace drags most of the characters remain relatively static the ending is so completely different to the tone of the previous four books that it felt jarring.Starting with the plot . Everything is drawn together nicely and Donaldson handles it all well despite the complexity the previous four books established . Finally both the plot following the main characters and the overarching plot are drawn together and begin really interacting . This plot is certainly the most explosive of the entire series.However the pacing of all this leaves something to be desired . Donaldson as per the previous two books flips through character perspectives . If you like examining the plot thoroughly from every angle you may enjoy this . But for me it dragged constantly examining the same events again and again . Donaldson only fleetingly spends time in third person subjective the rest of the time in third person objective or omniscient so the end result is alot of repetition about stuff we already know only from a slightly different perspective.It also gives the impression that Donaldson wanted to write a characterbased story but did n't quite know how . My problems with characters as I discussed a bit more in my review of Chaos and Order remain . Some of the characters bring their character developments to a head making big changes . Others however suffered massive changes abruptly which I found hard to believe . Furthermore several other characters are reduced to caricatures at pivotal moments in the story no less.The ending to it all well as I said earlier it 's slightly jarring . It 's the typical everything turned out better than expected ending . Not without losses and there were several more emotional moments throughout the book but those losses lacked any significant impact.Themes ? Well for the better part they remain muddy though they 're much clearer in this book than the other ones . It 's mostly about doing the right thing and being ethical . In the overall scheme of things though these are secondary and do n't have all that much attention drawn to them.Oh and finally the ancillary documentation chapters have been blasted out of existence . Three books too late but at least he got there in the end.I think that the series overall is good . The plot is the real strength of the story but it rarely compelled me in ways that my favourite books do . I think I could have put any of the books down in the middle and not resumed without much trouble . Nevertheless despite it 's flaws This Day All Gods Die only just manages to get the rating i 'm giving it.45 ",3
"Donaldson is best known for his work on Fantasy but this Sci Fi epic kept me on the edge of my seat . the 5 book series ending with This Day all Gods Die is simply tremendous . It is a page turner and makes you feel anger through most of it . The Heroes ' are mostly vile the victim shows tremendous strength . It is so complex and real feeling . truly terrific . ",4
"Donaldson certainly set a challenge for himself . The Gap series is one of the major achievements of speculative fiction and the second third and fourth books would easily make any list of the ten best science fiction novels of all time . In the fifth book then Donaldson somehow had to top the intensity of excitement of the previous volumes while keeping everything coherent and logically consistent.The first big plot twist is that the Amnion defensive Calm Horzions takes a turn for Earth . Armed with superlight proton cannon it could easily blast most of the planet . Having the bulk of the human race as hostages the Amnion are in a strong position to negotiate but their first demand takes everybody completely by surprise . Meanwhile the other event that readers have been waiting for the showdown between Holt Fasner and the civil government unfolds slowly but surely at Suka Bator . The tension surrounding both plotlines rises steadily throughout the book reaching a spectacular dual climax at the end . The conclusion will satisfy any fan of the series in addition to retroactively explaining the mysterious events from earlier in the series.The problem as you might guess just by looking at the book is wordiness . There are some points where we seem to be getting two paragraphs of psychological analysis for every one paragraph of action . This makes the book thick nearly seven hundred pages but it 's only a minor distraction from the good stuff at the end . ",3
"This volume caps Donaldson 's amazing Gap series . Those familiar with my reviews know that I do n't lightly describe something as amazing . This is easily the most captivating SF series I have read in years and unlike many series it does not peter out or become predictable in later volumes.As you would expect of Donaldson 's work the real story is about the characters and their flaws and struggles he takes us deep into the well developed personalities of each major character and how they persevere or fail despite their weaknesses.The series is pretty cleanly wrapped up in this volume with few unanswered questions left at the end . If you 've come this far in the series of course you want to read this one too ! ",4
"This book concludes the fivepart Gap Cycle . Several plot threads converge at Earth for a climactic ending . The showdown begins quite early in the book on page 197 of 688 . So it 's a bit protracted but I stayed up late finishing this book and it takes quite a page turner to make me forego sleep . Like in the previous books there are few wasted pages describing superfluous events or conversations . It 's nonstop.This book also contains what was for me the most emotional moment in the series one that nearly made my cry . I 've read many books that made me cry from laughter but this was due to an emotion more like exultation . And I ca n't remember the last time a book did that . I do n't want to give it away but I 'll say that it occurs just slightly under 35 of the way through the book . And it has to do with Angus Thermopyle . Now how did I come to like Angus so much ? He was outright scum of humanity in the first book . Donaldson 's pretty goodWell the ending 's good and most of the loose ends are wrapped up . The larger scale conflict however remains unresolved . I 'm not sure if Donaldson intends to continue the saga but I for one would love to reenter his universe for more . ",4
"I agree with the others that this series as a whole is just amazingly good . Granted it 's also amazingly brutal which can make it hard to recommend to friends but it 's one of the best scifi series I 've ever read . And the ending is just unbelievably good . I started reading the series around the time the 3rd book came out and waiting for the remaining two to be published was hard . I read this book 12 years ago so I do n't really remember many of the details but the simple fact that I still remember how amazingly good the series was and particularly the ending should speak volumes . ",4
"Here it is the final book of Donaldson 's Gap series . It does not disappoint . But I would be remiss if I did no warn all potential readers to make sure they have read all the other books of the series The Real Story The Gap into Conflict GapForbidden Knowledge The Gap Into Vision Forbidden KnowledgeA Dark and Hungry God Arises andChaos and Order The Gap Into Madness Gap . Though you could maybe just maybe read this book without having read the previous books you would be missing out on so much character development or deformation depending on your perspective as well as multiple plot twists and turns which really do make the story.It it quite an 'explosive ' conclusion in a very literal sense as well . Morn Hyland struggles trying to save humanity from what could be either a huge tragedy or a road to extinction while at the same time trying to draw together the tattered remains of her character and integrity and at the same time Warden Dios finally sees all his carefully laid plans begin to finally draw to fruition.Angus Thermopyle a cyborg finally released from his hardwired enslavement faces the dilemma of using his newfound freedom to flee from the chaos and danger or to utilize courage he 's never known to save those whom he has never cared for.Where this last of the Gap books picks up all the different threads Donaldson has been weaving throughout the last few books finally come together . It really is an incredible vision and an excellent example of very wellcrafted story.As a reader you finally get to see some of the despicable characters strive for some of the most unlikely potential and also to finally see some measure of peace come to the innocents who have been wounded and crushed in the midst of others machinations . The book does not quite retain the dark overtone which so pervaded the previous books of the series though there is still quite a strong nihilistic strain running through the narrative . This is definitely not a book or series for younger readers.So I do recommend this book but with many cautions . This specific book is still very dark overall with pretty descriptive violence and explicit language . Thusly I have to emphasize that it is for mature adult readers only at least in my mind . For the dark nature of the material the book engages and in some places almost embraces the tradeoff of being exposed to such things for the story you actually get is almost not worth it . It is excellently written and developed though so the only reason I actually recommend it is for the wellhoned craft the writer employs in his narrative . ",2
"Okay so Wales is n't that far off from me but it is a book which sweeps you away . The historical detail is so accurate that you know Barbara Erskine has done her research but it does n't detract from the story.Everything flows so well that it is easy to imagine the time and place . I really grew to like Eleyna and I was sorry to see the story end . It 's one to read again and would make a great present for people who like historical romance.Reveiwed by Annette Gisby author of Silent Screams . ",4
"Having read two of Ms Erskine 's books LADY OF HAY and KINGDOM OF SHADOWS finding this one with references to people in her other books was like visiting old friends . This book is a masterpiece which should be savored like fine wine and Godiva chocolate . The reader is catapulted thru time viewing all through the eyes of one woman who was wife mother and lover to some of the most interesting historical personas of the time . Although fiction the reader is given a uniquely detailed glimpse into the lives of British medieval historical personas seldom seen nor attemped by less gifted writers . With this book Ms Erskine is in a class by herself and should be read by both those who are new to her work and those who are fans . This is a must read for anyone who loves richly woven historical sagas . Jody Allen Charter member of RIOReviewers International Organization ",4
"I was very confused while reading this book until I reached the authors note at the end . Then everything made sense.If you 've read Sharon K. Penman 's Welsh trilogy you 'll remember that Llewellyn and Joanna married when Joanna was only 14 and that he had five children from two separate lovers one living one dead in childbirth . Llewellyn and Joanna then had two children first Ellen born when Joanna was sixteen and then David born some two or three years later . This make Ellen Llewellyn 's sixth child . This book has Ellen spelled Eleyne being born some fifteen years after her birth date by Penman 's book and being the younger of Joanna and Llewellyn 's six children.I was very confused by all of this . Who was right about the details ? Penman or Erskine ? Then I reached the authors note.The main character in this book is Eleyne daughter of Joanna and Llewellyn married four times and the grandmother of the royal Stewarts of Scotland . She is a composite character and in fact the woman Eleyne who was an ancestor of the house of the Stewart probably was n't the Ellen who was Joanna and Llewellyn 's daughter.If you did n't follow the above basically that means this book is a work of fiction not fact and the main characters as described in this book probably did n't exists . There was an Ellen of Whales who was married to John the Scot and Robin de Quincy and there was a woman named Ellen or Helen who married two Scottish lords and whose great granddaughter was queen of Scotland . But they probably were n't the same person.That said this is a very good book . Weather or not Ellen of Whales had the life described in this book is a moot point . It 's a highly entertaining story of love and destiny in the middle ages . Eleyne in this book is a very passionate vibrant woman . She has seen things in fire since she can remember the most common vision being a red haired man . Her father 's bard who follows the old gods tells her she will give birth to a line of Kings . When after her first husband dies she falls in love with the king of Scotland the man she saw all those times in the fire . But there love is not able to overcome to boundaries of marriage and the king dies without Eleyne bearing him a living son . She moves on to fall in love again but always Alexander the King watches over her and tries to keep her for himself.While the destiny aspects in this book are a little overbearing they are n't totally ridiculous . The only thing I really did n't like in this book was how Alexander would n't leave Eleyne alone once she was in love with her forth husband . Alexander kept popping up and making her have sex with his ghost . But men where like that thensome still are.This book gets a solid 4.5 stars ranking from me . Only not five because until the authors note I was confused . Read the Welsh trilogy of Sharon K. Penman if you like this book . ",4
"I realise that this book is n't sold in the US and you 'll have to find a secondhand copy but it will be worth the extra steps . This is Erskine 's finest piece of work ! I love this book so much I think I 've read it at least 20 times since I bought my first copy in cloth . Since then I have owned 2 paperbacks one which I lend out to friends and one that I read myself . If you love action drama history romance and mystery all rolled into one then this is the book for you . The heroine will live on long after you 've put the book back on the shelf . She is strong and brave in a world dominated by men . The book spans Eleyne 's life 12181306 of nearly 100 hundred years giving us a beautiful story of love loss and manipulation to sink our teeth into.Child of the Phoenix is based on a real person or two people so it is rich with British history . I went on to read Barbara Erskines other books after reading Child of the Phoenix and I loved them too however Phoenix is my favourite . Infact if I had to take one book on a desert island with me and believe me I LOVE books it would be Child of the Phoenix . This is Erskine 's only novel set in one time period her other books tend to involve two time periods . ",4
"In 1218 Eleyne is born amidst a burning castle in Wales . From infancy her nurse brings her up to support the Celtic cause against the English and she is taught how to use the flames to see into the future . Throughout her fascinating life Eleyne is married four times and produces numerous children . Several of the characters link up to character in other Erskine novels.I have read several of Barbara Erskine 's books and so far this is my favorite . The characters she created were vibrant and extremely engaging . I love the historical aspects she throws into her novels and I ca n't wait to read more . I only wish I had discovered this author earlier . ",4
"And fiction it is based upon historical characters and NOT historical fiction . The main character Elyne is according to the author 's notes at the end a composite of two characters one of them being Ellen the daughter of Llewellyn the Great and Joanna . I admit to being a bit put off at the first part of the book at the characterizations of some of the Welsh court particularly Joanna . Having read SKP'sHere Be Dragons and having adored Joanna and Llewlleyn and their great love I admit to grumbling abit at having Joanna being portrayed as such a sanctimonious biddy . Then I realized this was strictly a piece of fiction and I kicked back and thoroughly enjoyed the story . Lots of truly evil villains two timing false tongued kings some wonderful heros and a spooky ghost or two . What more can you ask for in a book ? Apparently some of the reviewers were put off by the size of the book . It went very quickly for me but then I 'm the type that does n't like to read any book under 500 pages if I can help it . As a side note Erskin 's books are not readily available in the US except by special order and thus paying freight . I was in Vancouver BC recently and found two of her books on the shelf at a major bookstore in downtown Vancouver on Robson street . If you 're in Canada it 's worth checking out . ",4
"I have read every book Barbara Erskine has published . I love her style and characters . Child of the Phoenix was the first book I read of hers and still remains one of my favourite books of all time . If you like her books you will also enjoy Elizabeth Harris 's books e.g . Herb Gatherers . They are the type of books you do n't put down until you have finished ! Keep it for a rainy day that you have all to yourself . ",4
"This is a great historical novel with a little bit of everything . There is definately a paranormal air to the novel although it is kept relatively quiet in the background . I really enjoyed this aspect of the story . There is also political plotting and scheming romance affairs betrayal war you name it . I enjoyed the author 's note at the end that made me think about what really may have happened and I especially liked knowing that some of it actually did according to the records . At times the story was a little boring particularly the parts that were heavily political and war related . I wish that the story with Einion could have had more of a conlusion and also that Rhonwynn could have stuck around longer or at least her spirit But overall this was a good book . I was worried about the length but after the first chapter of this book I was not concerned with the length at all I knew it would be good and it was . ",4
"I was a fan of Barbara Erskine but she is getting to be a very self indulgent writer . I loved her early works but the latest ones are really dragged out and now I feel a bit ripped off . From now on I will wait until they are at the library and not buy them . ",1
"I thought this story was very dry and hard to follow . I lost interest and never finished . ",0
"Read these books years ago and ordered them for my daughter to enjoy now . For me these books are even better than The Lord of the Rings series because these heroes are more human subject to frailties and capable of wonder . ",4
"I read both the first and second series when I was a teenager . I enjoyed all six books very much . I loved the fantasy creatures especially the Giants . I have just decided to reread the entire series now that the last set of books is complete.I found the story gripping and entertaining . I particularly like the symbolic way that Thomas and The Land are actually the same thing . As leprosy weakens Thomas 's body and insanity creeps into his mind so goes the fate of The Land . Good series worth reading if you like fantasy . ",3
"Has Mr. Donaldson written the fantasy story to end all fantasy stories ? Perhaps . But I 'll still read other stories.This series is phenomenal . The depth and scope of the story telling is as good if not better than Tolkien . If you like Tolkien you should love Donaldson 's Thomas Covenant series.Some people have trouble reading Donaldson because he uses big words and because of this his book is criticized . Too bad . Grab a dictionary you sloth . Not you of course I mean the other person behind you who is bad mouthing this story & ltgrins & gt.Each night I read a little more and each night I cared even more about the characters than I did the previous night . To me that is one sign of an excellent story . When it was all over I was saddened that Mr. Donaldson had n't written a third series . But I hear rumours that he might . One can always dream . ",4
"Overall this is a good trilogy of novels . It is a very character driven series focusing more on the inner workings of the main character than the plot . Overall this is a strength to the series not a weakness . The plot itself is solid enough.Essentially Thomas Covenant is a leper and an author in our world who is pulled into another realm to help be the savior of the land . Covenant is a very wounded main character the result of his leperosy in the real world.Here is what I disliked about the novel Thomas Covenant is the biggest whiner I have ever read . The guy is so self centered and pathetic its hard to care about him . I am a doctor have been to leperosy camps and have also suffered with cancer for 2 years . I have never met a patient with any disease who took it as poorly as Thomas Covenant does . It bordered on unbelievable to me that someone could tackle a disease as poorly as this guy does . Covenants first act in the new world he comes to is to rape an underage girl . Wow great way to make me care about the protagonist . Not only do I hate rape and the character who did it but the act itslef was completely out of character from everything else Covenant does . While he is pathetic and whiny he is not aggressive or a rapist . I just didnt understand this plot point . It had little to do with the overall story and really alienates the reader so far from caring about the protagonist Also he basically refuses to help out or do anything usefull for the entire 3 books . That is until the very end where he decides suddenly to go to the dark lord 's territory and end everything . This sudden change of attitude made no sense and wasnt developed . I could go on and on about this but I wont.So overall an interestnig trilogy . Recommended for those who like character driven fantasy ie Robin Hobb ect . Those people who hate these books almost universally feel this way because of the way the character of Thomas Covenant is written . Its not easy to read or care about him . ",3
"Started 30+ years ago this saga kept me spellbound for months . A wonderful fantasy with an interesting approach an antihero main character . ",4
"I read this in the early 80 's as a teenager and absolutely loved it . After the popularity of the Lord of the Rings movies I bought the trilogy for a nephew who had fallen in love with Tolkein and he had the same opinion that I did this was a more enjoyable story than Rings . I did n't say better especially since so many elements of Covenant are blatantly copied from Rings the ring as a talisman a disembodied near all powerful nemesis Woodwrights=Ents etc but the charecters and the storyline are masterful . When I gave it to my nephew I reread the copies that I had and once again came to the same conclusion that this series was more enjoyable than Rings . I also reread Rings during the popularity of the movies and yes they are an example of great storytelling.I must say though that the Rings movies far exceeded the books for me . I ca n't wait to see if someone will ever bring this series to the screen . ",3
"I 've read all of the reviews here and have something to say to those with negative opinions of this series for those of you who have relayed your reviews succinctly I respect your collective opinions . This series is not for everyone . But to those who 's reviews seemed to reflect confusion please give this series another try . You obviously did not 'get it . 'This series is not about a fantasy land within which Covenant travels such as other fantasy books dictate yes it is a story of a man who travels through the Land however it is mostly about what happens to a person physically emotionally mentally who contracts and suffers with leprosy . The Land was Covenant literally . When you look back at the characters at the nuances of the Land at the abilities of the Lords and such and then put these details to the variety of physical aspects of the body you can see a whole other series and story taking place.Covenant was the Land . Though it is dreary and somewhat tiresome to read the first book Lord Foul 's Bane is the most important . It is where you the reader learn all you need to know about leprosy . Apply all that you learn there to the rest of this series and the next three books and you have a deeper understanding of Donaldson 's genius.BTW on a side note Donaldson a master of language spent some time in India with his father who worked very closely with lepers . His experiences there shine through in this series.The followup series ' first book The Runes of the Earth follows the same pattern as this sets of series except instead of leprosy the story follows a more psychological approach mainly psychosis . I am anxious to read the next three books in the final series of this epic.When I read this series and the series that followed I was so stunned by everything the story the characters the method of Donaldson 's writing I could read nothing else for a year . It was roughly 12 months later that I finally broke down and bought the Myth series by Robert Aspirin to 'clean my pallet ' so that I could once again read a serious fantasy series.And know that this series was written well before most of the fantasy series you have probably read .

"I read this trilogy originally back in the late 1970s . In paperback they were nice reading on an airplane and in an airport while traveling . I later got them from the Science Fiction Book club and have completely worn out that set of books . I spot this and grabbed it as a replacement for those worn out books.I know the complete chronicles is not yet over . There is still supposed to be one more book published next fall . However the start is needed to get to the end.I found the parts of the books in the normal world a bit tedious and I found my self angry at the mistreatment of one man who had no control over what had happened to him . That people in this day and age are still so fearful and superstitious is just hard to believe.In the Land it 's another story . The characters are so well developed that you feel you really do know them . Of all the characters I like Mhoram with his rudder of a nose to steer him in the right direction and huge but gentle at heart Saltheart Foamfollower the best.Do yourself a favor if you like epic fantasy grab this book ! For three books in one volume it 's not that big . the binding is well done the pages are so smooth and easy to turn and it is actually easy to hold but still a bit heavy at over 650 pages . ",4
"Sophisticated readers insist you must love this book or you 're ignorant and uncaring tut ! tut ! Updated 16 Oct 13 I took a lot of flack because I did not like the book or the main character . The most common flame was oh ! You brute ! Thomas is a 'leper ' ! How can you judge a leper ? Just because someone has a legitimate issue does not mean that I have to approve of their reaction to the issue or enjoy reading about it . If someone put a camera in a public toilet I would not feel compelled to watch it in the name of art . So while I understand Thomas is a leper it really does n't justify his actions or make it fun to read about.It is not a bad trilogy . It is just not near the top of the must read stack of fantasy trilogies . If you longingly remember the series from the early 80s then my recommendation is to read Donaldson 's more recent works and leave the happy memories from the first time you read it.Thirty years ago my friends had nothing but praise for several fantasy series Lord of the Rings the Iron Tower the Narnia books and Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever.At the time I enjoyed the Iron Tower series but did not have time to read the other three.Life has been a whirlwind since then and finally I have had a chance to go back and read some of these classic fantasy series.The Iron Tower series holds upThe Iron Tower Omnibus Mithgar . The writing is tight with interesting characters and real growth in the protagonist.The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Hobbit also have aged well . The prose can be a little dense at times today 's writers do not typically spend three to four pages describing the flora in a random meadow enroute to a destination . But the plot the development of the characters and the sweep of the saga make this one of the best fantasy trilogies of all time.Narnia is a fine series . It is different than Lord of the Rings . Lord of the Rings was really written for the adult community . The Narnia series was written for children . I look forward to reading Narnia to future grandchildren.On to our White Gold wielding friend be warned spoilers follow The protagonist is a leper by the name of Thomas Covenant . He is a wretched bitter creature who was deserted by his wife and son and Covenant returns the scorn of the world with two heaping scoops of indignation and rage.There is really nothing nothing appealing about him.Mr . Donaldson clearly did his research on leprosy but I found it very very difficult to relate to Thomas Covenant.In the first book Thomas takes a stroll into town for no particular reason . His phone bill is being paid for by someone else . It could have been for charitable reasons but Mr. Covenant assumes in his bitter paranoid mind that someone has paid for his bill because society wants to shun him.As a protest against the world Mr. Covenant decides to stroll into town to pay his own bill . That will show them ! Er um ok Covenant meets an apparently homeless man who we find out in book three is actually God . God gives Covenant a contrived piece of advice . After a completely abortive attempt to pay the bill Covenant gets hit by a police car and when he passes out he is magically teleported to the Land.This where Donaldson does his best . The Land is a detailed interesting fantasy world . While I do n't mind a little purple prose i.e . superfluous description Donaldson does manage to pack 53 pages of action into 1100+ pages of description.Covenant finds himself as potentially the only hope to defeat the evil force at work in the world.So how does Covenant react to this ? He is a total jerk . He ends up raping a woman in the first three days he is there.Covenant poops on his friends . He acts the coward and Covenant rejects his fate hence the title Unbeliever.Through an unlikely series of happenstance and against Covenant 's nature and choices he does end up helping out the natives of the Land but there is an outstanding prophecy that spells doom for the Land but hey who cares ? There is some subplot about Covenant coming to the Land as a leper and being cured while in the Land.Why would Covenant want to go back to the real world ? Who knows.In any event Covenant returns to the real world.This brings us to book two.Covenant is feeling bitter and angry and decides to visit the nearest large town just to stir things up.He heads to a cocktail bar where dum dum dum his estranged wife is performing.After Covenant is run out of town on a rail by the local sheriff Covenant 's wife calls him . While she is talking Covenant is drawn back to the Land . He falls hits his head and he petulantly wants to go back to the real world as soon as he arrives even though his inaction and selfabsorbed ways leads to the death of several characters.This book is more of the same but it takes more than half of the book before Covenant finally decides to aid the Land.This book introduces another character from the real world . In this case he is a blind man.The blind man does not want to return to blindness in the real world.Over the course of the book Covenant who is deeply deeply committed to his estranged wife and marriage as shown in the first several chapters manages to fornicate and spawn a child.Ummmm what ? OK OK so just push the suspend disbelief button.Anyhow the Staff of Law is broken during the final events of the novel.Enter book three more of the same.In chapters 20 and 21 Covenant finally channels his rage into defeating the adversary and eventually the Illearth Stone.In a deus ex machina Covenant 's property is saved and he is the town hero because at one point he randomly saves a run away girl.I 'm going to see if the second trilogy is any better than the first.Update 18 DEC 13 it 's more of the sameIn serviceRich ",2
"there is not really too much that I want to say about the thomas covenant series of books I love epic fantasy and after tolkien i think donaldson 's 6 books plus of thomas covenant and the land is the next best read . truthfully donaldson wrote the first 2 sets 6 books in the late 70s I have read these 6 books perhaps 30 times since then I do n't think I need to say much more than thaton top of everything donaldson is a very down to earth and nice guy altho he is a bit harder to reach now after all these years the last book of thomas covenant that would make 9 is coming out this fall I think5 stars is not enough for this epic i would do 5 stars for each of the first 6 books ",4
"Along with its sequels A Good Clean Fight and Damned Good Show this is one of the best books to come out of World War II . The three of them are certainly the liveliest and most entertaining I 've read about the air war along with Len Deighton 's Bomber almost as if Dickens or Tolstoy had been in the RAF . I think what most distinguishes the three novels is the character of Skull Skelton a kind of Candide figure . An Oxford history don pressed into service as an RAF intelligence officer Skull simply can not resist explaining to the fighter pilots bomber pilots military administrators and other RAF types he is supposed to be encouraging just exactly how practically and morally futile their activities are in a historical context . He keeps getting kicked around for this but he keeps on doing it which brings a profound and even somewhat hopeful dimension to what might otherwise be dismissed as nihilistic thrillers which Robinson 's work unfortunately gets dismissed as judging from its limited availability in libraries and other establishment venues . Skull is not the main character he just keeps popping up at odd moments . And that is part of what makes him so effective because the novels ' antiwar theme never gets preachy like Hersey 's The War Lover or programatic and repetitive like Heller 's Catch 22.These three books should be much more widely available as a unit although Damned Good Show falls off a little from the first two as though Robinson was getting discouraged at the sparse response to A Good Clean Fight .

"I read this book in 1993 when it came out . Having served for five years in the ranks of the RAF 195358 I was enthralled and enchanted by seeing so many of the people I had known come to life . The feckless irresponsibility of the young pilot officers having races down mansion staircases seated on silver serving trays the stubbornness of the Wing Commander who held tight formations no matter how fatal real people real life.Perhaps to American eyes there are aspects of the class interaction that may seem to be cariacatures but they are not . The chap who attended a good public school means private school in the U.S. was accepted by his peers as a person of station and his foibles were viewed as the right of the privileged class . The poor erks as we were known were as far down the pecking order as it was possible to be and only longed for a condescending glance of approval from those above us.Living lively if you want to know what real war felt like this book does it . You 'll never forget Baggy and his unfortunate demise . ",4
"Piece of Cake ranks right up there with Winds of War and Catch 22 . Wait a sec ! Those two novels are n't anything alike . That 's what makes Piece of Cake so different and wonderful . There 's all the drama and hilarity of the other two but tied into an incredible story that not only puts you in the cockpit but in the midst of battle . Some would say P of C is a drama about the Battle of Britain . More than that . Much more . A fighter squadron is made up of people who think quite differently about the world about the war and about staying alive . What are they fighting for ? Themselves . Their buddies . Booze . Women . Pretty much in that order . King and country ? Well yeah sort of.Piece of Cake also has a history to tell and in the telling lays low myths like a well sharpened scythe in a field of lilies . Gives you a new perspective on the war but more than that like any great novel it works its way into your brain and into your guts enough to make you wonder what you know and what you think you know.The characters stand out from the page as if you 'd just had one beer and they 'd asked you to buy another round . Or more likely they 'd held you upside down until all your money fell out and you had no choice but to buy another round . These are men who live in the same small room as darkness and danger . You 'll meet quite a few of them and you 'll be happy you did . I do n't give one care if you do n't like novels about flying and war and historical events . Does n't matter a whit . You 'll still love this book . ",4
"I looked for this book after catching the end of the miniseries on TV . I guess the author broke a lot of rules about characters and probably other things too but I loved it . You might be introduced to a character learn all about him and find him dead two pages later . This gave me a sense for what it might have been like to live through those harrowing years . The readers just like the aviators themselves do n't know who 's going to make it through . An absolutely fascinating drama . Highly recommended ! ",4
"The Battle of Britain . Dashing fearless young patriots out of Shakespeare take to their machines to save Albion from Nazi bombers . Battling hopeless odds and a vastly superior enemy these lions of the sky prevail against evil save democracy and land back at base in time for their tea.Or not.Derek Robinson 's Piece of Cake has to be one of the most brutally cynical mythdebunking pieces of historical fiction ever put to pen . In its 650+ pages it methodically and at times gleefully ravages the heroic sterotype of Britain 's fighter pilots cemented by the hundreds of books movies and documentaries which have come out since the war . In the language of the book it puts paid to all that bumf and tells the truth or rather Robinson 's version of it.Cake is the story of Hornet Squadron a rather average collection of fighter pilots flying Hurricanes between September 1939 and September 1940 . It details their involvement in the phoney war the Battle of France and lastly the Battle of Britain . From the very first chapter when a number of the pilots wreck their car while driving home drunk from a pub then steal a tractor and finally horses to get back to their base the reader begins to realize that we few we happy few we band of brothers is nowhere to be found here . With the occasional exception Hornet Squadron is a collection of snobbish selfish sophomoric nottooterribly bright adrenaline junkies who joined the RAF in the hopes of blowing things up without legal consequences . It 's a case of be careful what you wish for times two.For a story with so many characters the squadron has more than a dozen and chaps are always getting knocked off and replaced Robinson does a terrific job of keeping them all fresh and distinct from each other . Each reader will have his own favorite good guy goodhearted flight leader Fanny Barton the coldblooded American volunteer Christopher Hart CH3 the crazy as a loon Flash Gordon or possibly the nonfighting duo of Uncle Kellaway the squadron adj and his sidekick an Oxford don turned intelligence officer Skull Skellen who spend a lot of time arguing about squirrels . There is no question about the squadron 's biggest bastard not since GoodFellas Joe PesciTommy DeVito did I hate somebody as much as Lance Moggy Cattermole the big smoothtalking sociopath who seems to enjoy tormenting and using his squadron mates even more than he likes to machinegun German pilots as they hang helpless in their parachutes . Robinson takes positive delight in showing how how Hart 's theory that up there the world is divided into bastards and suckers also applies on terra firma.Piece of Cake was a contraversial book not only for its thoroughly unglamorous depiction of the RAF jocks but because it expands on the touchy and undiscussed issue of the RAF 's kill claims . The pilots who in fairness can hardly be blamed for making mistakes given the nature of air combat prior to the installation of the gun camera claimed about 2.5 German aircraft destroyed for every one that actually was . The vastly overstated statistics issued by the RAF made their way into the postwar literature and contributed to the mythos surrounding the battle . In point of fact the Germans had about 900 fighters to the Brits 600 and the Me 109 was badly hampered by its extremely short range and the necessity to try and protect the bombers . The odds were somewhat closer than the Brits care to believe.Piece of Cake was n't written to disparage the courage of the British pilots or denigrate their accomplishments but to show them for what they were young often immature officerboys of varying character who sometimes died stupid and futile deaths . In other words human beings at war . In this sense Robinson does the RAF a favor for heroism is much more impressive when it comes from real people rather than Hollywood cartoons . After all peacetime flaws often make for wartime virtues . Or as Hart says to Fanny Barton about Moggy He really does like killing people . You do n't know how lucky you are to have him . ",3
"I remember a few moons ago about 20 years ago really seeing something about the miniseries Piece of Cake and not being able to watch it sorry to poor to afford it then and being a little interested in aviation warfare I decided I 'd have to read it at some point . After spending sometime looking about and finally deciding to deal in the second hand market I picked up a copy of Piece of Cake.Piece of Cake describes a British squadron Hornet Squadron flying Hurricanes for those that are interested in the early days of WWII September 1939 thru September 1940 . Mr. Robinson uses the cloak of early WWII historical setting and British tactics to tell the story and interactions of the men of Hornet Squadron . All of the characters are larger than life at times making them a little hard to believe but having known many fighter pilots in my day I can say that the only possibly making it difficult to believe is having all of these characters in one unit . Each character is nicely done with personal details that are amazing whether its Moggy and his egocentrichomicidal ways CH3 and his this is the way it was done in Spain Lord Rex is proper British to Fanny Barton and his caring ways . The exploits are fascinating there 's some interesting romance situations especially given the Phony War and the lead up to the Battle for France . The historical perspective is nicely done with Mr. Robinson showing good awareness of RAF tactics and battle situations . If there 's a weakness in the book it 's that Mr. Robinson 's dark humor sometimes overshadows thing to much and he overemphasis the inflated claims of the RAF during the Battle of Britain and their losses.Rating wise this ones a very solid 4 star book . The first half is a little slow and drawn out as Mr. Robinson explains Hornet Squadron 's makeup and things begin to gel . As you pass from the Phony War to the Battle for France there 's a nice step up in the story that pushes the book toward 4.5 stars . This is eventually reached during the Battle of Britain with a momentary 5 star piece with the interactions between Moggy and SteelStebbing you need to read it great for a laugh . Given everything a solid 4 star performance . ",3
"Piece of Cake is much more than just a very well written war novel which it is . In Piece of Cake aviation author Derek Robinson uses the small group genre by focuses on the notional Hornet squadron as a means to bring to light many of the Royal Air Force 's doctrinal equipment and personnel deficiencies in the first year of the Second War . Piece of Cake is also a darn good examination of character and leadership or lack of in warfare . Typically the few who flew for Britain in 19391941 are presented as an exemplary elite who sacrificed themselves for the greater good . In Piece of Cake Robinson may have angered those who favored such a hallowed historiography but he gives the reader a greater insight into what was probably much closer to the actual mark in Fighter Command in this early phase of the war . Indeed it would be fair to rank Piece of Cake among the best war novels ever written.Robinson 's plot line follows the notional Hornet Squadron from 1 September 1939 to 15 September 1940 and the unit is equipped with Hurricane I and II fighters not Spitfires as in the film version . The reader is presented with three different leadership styles in the squadron leaders the selfdestructive style of Ramsey the arrogant style of Rex and the fatalistic style of Fanny Barton . The squadron adjutant Uncle Kellaway and the intelligence officer Skull Skelton also add considerable depth on the human and scientific sides of warfare . The pilots themselves are a pretty stock bunch as they are in most Robinson novels with the exceptions of the sociopath Moggy Cattermole and the American Chris Hart . Indeed one of the major differences between the book and the film is the relationship between Moggy and Squadron Leader Rex which is never explained in the film . In the book Robinson paints Moggy in the role of the squadron enforcer who is fiercely loyal to Rex due to perks provided . Indeed Moggy even kills to protect Rex which is odd for a character that displays no loyalty to anyone else in the squadron.Robinson 's portrayal of the RAF 's inadequate tactics and doctrine is quite interesting . In particular the large formation fighting area attacks put the RAF at a major disadvantage against the Luftwaffe 's more fluid finger four tactics . Indeed through A Piece of Cake the reader is presented with a year 's worth of tactical and doctrinal evolution in the RAF with the initial faulty methods yielding grudgingly to more sensible means of waging air warfare . Robinson also seems to include every fighter pilot lesson learned in A Piece of Cake which makes the novel virtually a primer for dog fighting e.g . never climb away from the sun do n't always break left the favored direction . Yet despite Hornet Squadron 's tactical improvements Robinson shows that survival in warfare still comes down to a certain matter of luck as even the veteran pilots succumb to mistakes and fatigue . Few other accounts of the Battle of Britain demonstrate how punishing the AugustSeptember 1940 campaign was to RAF fighter squadrons as well as Robinson 's fictional account.Probably the only defect in A Piece Cake is the lack of perspective from the enemy side . In Robinson 's later A Good Clean Fight he does provide some insight from the enemy perspective but this is lacking in A Piece of Cake . The number of squadron veteran pilots is ever dwindling in the face of the massed Luftwaffe attacks but the results are uncertain given Skull 's exposure of dubious pilot kill claims . In Robinson 's novel the reader is unsure who is actually winning the Battle of Britain certainly the actual participants would have been uncertain at that moment too but it is suggested that the British are exaggerating their kill claims for propaganda purposes . Certainly in retrospect the Battle of Britain seems more like a goal line stand than an outright victory but Robinson 's portrayal may strike some readers armed with knowledge of the end result as ambiguous or even defeatist in tone . Furthermore the Luftwaffe also suffered from faulty doctrine being designed as a tactical not a strategic bombing force and inadequate equipment shortrange Me109s the clumsy Me110 . If Robinson had provided a bit of enemy perspective even with a captured pilot or two this might have shown that the campaign was punishing and frustrating for both sides . ",4
"The author of this wellwritten story aimed for controversy this is an attack on that British sacred cow the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . Although well researched and presenting some uncomfortable truths there is a good deal of meanspiritedness in the depiction of the characters and a lot of unnecessary ugliness.Robinson presents us with the doomed pilots of Hornet Squadron a collection of largely inexperienced soldiers sent to war with what the author considers misguided tactical training . One of the book 's main points is that British losses were heavier and German losses lighter than the British claimed at the time . Pilots are lost long before the squadron sees any action however and a good deal of stress is laid on the personal shortcomings of the airmen . An American veteran of the Spanish Civil War joins the squadron and the author makes some points about military classconsciousness A La The Revolt of Gunner Asch oh it exists in other armies ? What a surprise ! The BBC TV version was quite faithful to the book . I found both to be a little too unpleasant for my own taste . ",2
"Great book about the Battle of Britain . Take off in a Hurricane to face Hitler 's aerial assault ! I do n't think this author subscribes to the greatest generation theory ! Hooligans are just as much a part of this story as heroes . I really liked that the author showed exploits on the ground as well as the air and that they were not necessarily laudable ! Pick this book if you are interested in England World War 2 the Battle of Britain or aviation . Great read ! ",4
"This book was made into a Masterpiece Theatre series on PBS in the late 1980 's . It is an enthralling production . Years later I read the book and highly recommend both . Robinson gave some very vivid scenes of aerial battle in the skies over England and the Channel . Whether you read it first or view it first you 'll want to do both . ",4
"This book which was the subject of a Master Piece Theater presentation is witty and fun to read . Even though it is a work of fiction The story takes the reader directly into the world of the RAF early in the war . ",4
"The story of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I from her auspicious birth as the daughter of the fascinating Anne Boleyn through her fears of losing her life under her father 's brother 's and sister 's reigns and continuing until the end of her life.Jean Plaidy always presents history in such a fascinating way . By presenting Elizabeth 's story from her own perspective it makes the history seem alive and Elizabeth as a vibrant woman not as the dry mannequin she seems like in history books . ",3
"I 've been a Queen Elizabeth I fan since I was a little girl and I enjoy reading or watching anything about her . This book was right up my alley.I do love that this starts from the beginning of her life as all Jean Plaidy 's Queen 's of England series do . I like how Plaidy shows how precarious her position was under her father and halfbrother and sister Edward and Mary . She shows how Elizabeth looked to the mistakes of others and learns from them . She even shows the mistakes Elizabeth makes and shows them to be learning points for the queen she is to become.But Elizabeth is n't all glory . She is a vain and selfish person at times and sometimes I felt that was all she was . But in her characteristic style she was able to pull me back into loving her again.I felt that Plaidy has taken a wonderful and great person and made her more human than the history books can . Even though Elizabeth 's selfishness sometimes made me want to scream it was who she was and that gives the book something different from others.In comparision to Phillipa Gregory 's novels Plaidy 's Elizabeth can think for herself without having men to do all the thinking for her . This is the Elizabeth I 've come to love . I do like how Jean Plaidy shows that although she loved Robert Dudley she did n't give into thim and felt that she did n't have to marry and have a king beside her in order to rule . She truly was a woman ahead of her time.We have Queen Elizabeth I to thank for the defeat of the Spanish Armada the settling of Virginia and William Shakespeare . And in Plaidy 's novel all of these things are place in perfect rhythym with Court life Elizabeth 's affections for certain men and her hatred of others.I do feel however that her hatred of Lettic Knolly 's was really unfounded . I found no reason for her to hate her other than the fact that she just does.This is a good and meaty book that is sure to give hours of pleasure . ",3
"I 've read several nonfiction books on Queen Elizabeth 1 now and Plaidy did a wonderful job of fictionally portraying her.Obviously we will never know the Queen 's true feelings on some subjects because she did a great job of keeping people guessing but I liked the Elizabeth that is in this book ! ",4
"really enjoyable story of QE I 's life from her perspective . easy reading great gossipy drama like we chicks love and you learn much about brit history.if the author wrote on a little higher intellectual level like umberto eco or something on penguin books it would b a 55.would be a great gift for young girls because QE I is a great role model she kicks butt in a man 's world she 's smart and does n't let men control her . ",3
"I have read a dozen historical novels about Queen Elizabeth I and this one is by far the best.Comprehensively researched richly detailed and written in an exciting and vibrant manner there is not an aspect of Elizabeth 's life that the author does not touch on.From her childhood trauma at the execution of her mother when she was three and Elizabeth being branded as a 'bastard ' through to her precarious hold onto her life while she came under danger during the reigns of her father brother and sister.Wonderful examination of her sexual exploitation by her stepfather Sir Thomas Seymour how she escaped death under the reign of her elder halfsister Bloody Mary as illustrated by her carving of the words Much suspected by me Nothing proved can be Quoth Elizabeth prisoner into a window at Woodstock Manor.The book well illustrates what shaped Elizabeth into the cunning and wily and vain but not unmerciful ruler.It explores her deep love for Robert Dudley Earl of Leicester her life soul mateof whom even he she would not marry determined to share her throne with no one . also her fascination and adoration of the vain and foolish young Earl of Leicester who she was forced to have executed after his attempts to depose her.Her religious convictions are shown to be of expedience . she would choose the faith her subjects wanted England to be governed by which was why she was a Protestant in a fervently Protestant England reeling from the horrors of Mary I 's attempt to transfer the Spanish Inquisition to England.The book is sympathetic to Elizabeth nothing like Philippa Gregory 's vilification of her but at the same time does not gloss over her faults.It portrays her great guilt at the execution of Mary queen of Scots and her finest hour in rallying England to defend her shores and win the great victory against the Spanish Armada that threatened her realm and the freedom of her peoplethe Spanish ships carried devices of torture designed to bring all of the horrors of the Inquisition to England.Great characterization realistic and yet fascinating and gripping . True to form of one of Jean Plaidy who with 50 intriguing title to her name remains one of the greatest historical novelists of English historyWell worth the time and effort . ",4
"For those looking for a detailed and surface historical account of Queen Elizabeth 's reign then look to this novel by Jean Plaidy . However for those looking for drama intrigue and a thrilling read look elsewhere.The book begins on an interesting note as it traces Queen Elizabeth 's childhood which often is not included in movies and other accounts . Her childhood I might add was the most entertaining part of the book.As Plaidy takes her readers further into the life of the Queen the yawns from boredom increased . Her novel becomes too technical and spends way too much time talking about who each and every subject related to the Queen isoften at times even delving into characters that the reader need not know at all.Lastly I found it most disappointing that Plaidy wrote as if the Queen truly had remained a total and utter virgin even down to abstaining from any romantic kiss . Yes Queen Elizabeth was a supreme ruler and an admirable woman there is no doubt to this fact but maybe it 's just meI find it hard to believe that a Queen who had her pick of all the men in Europe would not once in her 70 years indulge herself romantically . Was she not completely in love with Robert it is stated as such over and over again in the novel ? I am sure that at least once there was some passion between them . Just do n't expect to find any of it in this strictly G rated novel . ",2
"Plaidy has done a great job with Elizabeth . Although it 's written sort of like a diary which can get boring she manages to keep the pace going well . Since she a writer who stays true to history we gain not only knowledge about this period but also insights into the young girl frightened for her life who matures into an old queen still longing for love and admiration . A really good read and there are n't many books these days that can keep me engaged for four hundred pages . ",4
"Queen of This Realm is one of Plaidy 's best novels a complete fictional look at the youth and reign of Queen Elizabeth I . Written as a memoir by Queen Elizabeth you will learn about her first scandalous love affair with her stepmother Katherine Parr 's husband and the following lifelong unconsummated love of her life Robert Dudley . Love and betrayal were all a part of the Queen 's life and it often reads like a soap opera ! Queen Elizabeth was bold highly intelligent supremely vain and one of the greatest monarchs of England . You will be taken in and enthralled by the story of her close calls with execution at the hand of her sister Queen Mary and her fascination with and eventual execution of her cousin Mary Stuart Queen of Scotland who plotted to claim the English throne as her own for most of her life her story is told in Royal Road To Fotheringay to be reissued Fall 2004.This is a stellar novel you wo n't believe how fascinating history can be to read until you 've read Plaidy ! She has written over 50 books most of which are out of print but can be found in libraries and online . Once you start reading her you ca n't stop ! ",4
"I liked this book very much . It conformed pretty closely with my own image of Gloriana a woman who could n't afford to let herself act like one and a tempermental vain but most of all very intelligent monarch.I also very much appreciated that Ms. Plaidy did n't choose to dabble in the 'multiple lovers ' and 'secret children ' nonsense so prevelant among historical fiction accounts . It 's so refreshing not to have to wade through the garbage.However there was one aspect of the story that bothered me only a little at first but by the time I finished it had nearly ruined the book Elizabeth 's constant physical violence against nearly everyone . She everlastingly reports 'nipping ' 'pinching ' and 'slapping . ' In reality there are only a few recorded instances of this happening and I doubt that her ladies would have loved her as much as they did if they had been under unceasing physical attack while performing their duties.Also I did n't appreciate the furthering of the myth of 'Bloody Mary . ' Cue thunderbolts and scary music . I think history has pretty well established that Mary was not a monster nor were her years as queen a waste or a prelude to the time of Elizabeth . Mary Tudor was a sweet sensitive person who went through unimaginable pain and emotional torment . I think that 's quite enough for one person without also being constantly maligned by popular history.In the end I realize that these are fairly small complaints when compared with such a very good book . Thank you Ms. Plaidy ! ",3
"This is the second volume in Jean Plaidy 's wellwritten Queens of England series of books . As in all the books in this series it is written as a first person narrative creating an intimacy of style that makes the book all the more compelling and immensely readable . Replete with fascinating period detail political machinations public personages and historical events that were a part of the life of Queen Elizabeth I the author builds a fascinating three dimensional portrait of a woman and queen.The author recounts the early years of Elizabeth a troubled child unsure of her place in the affections of her father King Henry VIII . Knowing that he had had her mother Anne Boleyn beheaded an impressionable Elizabeth observed the succession of women who took her mother 's place and assessed how they fared at her father 's hands.Elizabeth lived through the reign of her younger halfbrother Edward VI as well as that of her halfsister Mary during whose reign Elizabeth would come perilously close to losing her life under allegations of treason . Having survived the reign of her sister whose legacy would forever enshrine her in history as Bloody Mary for her fanatical persecution of Catholics Elizabeth would come to the throne as a Protestant with a penchant for religious tolerance towards her Catholic subjects.The author takes the reader through the ascension of Elizabeth to the throne and her glorious reign making the reader understand why Elizabeth I is revered as one of the greatest monarchs the world has ever known . From the early halcyon days of her reign to the more troubled ones that were to follow the author fully engages the reader . The author also recounts the story of Elizabeth 's close relationship with Robert Dudley her Master of Horse whom she would make the Earl of Leicester.Through her Dudley became one of the most powerful men in her kingdom as Elizabeth I granted him all but his most fervent wish which was to have her hand in marriage . This wily and scholarly Queen would not share her power with any man not even Dudley a man she professed to love . Nonetheless she would have a life long relationship with Robert Dudley and his death while in his fifties would mark Elizabeth I for the remainder of her long life.The fractious relationships Elizabeth I would have with some of her courtiers are recounted as are the ones that were more harmonious . Familial relationships scandals and intrigues would also have their impact not just on Elizabeth I but on the monarchy and the world as well . Such is the lot of monarchs and the reign of Elizabeth I was no different . World events and their effect on England also pepper this book and at the center of it all was the indomitable Elizabeth I a queen regnant who made England into a world power with which to be reckoned . Her reign would go down in history as the glorious Elizabethan era.This is a wonderful book that those with a penchant for historical fiction will no doubt enjoy . Ms. Plaidy is a master storyteller seamlessly weaving a tapestry of events and personalities that make this book one to be savored . ",4
"This book gives a multi dimensional perspective of one of the most complex people of all time . Queen Elizabeth was surely an engima and Jean Plaidy brought her to life in a most believable way . ",3
"From the opening lines When I look over the first twentyfive years of my life and consider the number of times I was in danger of losing it the reader is swept up into the majestic mind and spirit of the iconic Elizabeth I. Jean Plaidy began writing historical fiction in the fifties and to the modernday reader she may seem a tad dated and naive yet her consummate command of history and ability to effortlessly transition from scene to scene are commanding and refreshing in an era of overheated fiction and an emphasis on the lurid.A friend loaned me this book I found it captivating and immensely easy to read even as I learned about Elizabeth and her times . This is a vastly different Elizabeth from the devious narcissist of Philippa Gregory 's works or the volatile spirited girl of C.W.Gortner 's book but she is worth exploring all the same . ",4
"This is the seventh Jean Plaidy novel that I have read . I enjoyed it and read the book within 4 days . I got a good overview of the life of Elizabeth and I think the best part was getting her life in chronological order . Some movies that I have seen recently such as Elizabeth The Golden Age decide to completely disregard her age and the mood of the English people.I gave it four stars because it is very repetitive which is my main complaint with almost all of Plaidy 's novels . She repeats the characterizations of Elizabeth 's men numerous times and it is a bit irritating.However I would recommend it as a good novel for Elizabeth fans . But my 2 favorite Plaidy novels remain The Thistle and the Rose and Mary Queen of France about Henry VIII 's 2 sisters . ",3
"The complete story of Queen Elizabeth . This gives a very believable account of the virgin queen and her wouldbe lovers . To Elizabeth power was what love was to other women and ruled her life . She instinctively knew that yielding to a man would diminish her power . This was an educational story of the Elizabethan times as well as a warm account of Elizabeth . ",4
"Queen of This Realm tells the story of one of England 's most remembered monarchs Queen Elizabeth I beginning with childhood and continuing on with her adult life as Queen.As usual Jean Plaidy tells a detailed mainly historically accurate story this time from Elizabeth 's point of view . The novel is a bit slow in places but overall a great read . It is especially interesting to read Plaidy 's take on Elizabeth 's feelings at certain pivotal times of her life such as with the death of Amy Robsart . And who knew she enjoyed pinching people 's arms so much Plaidy often refers to her doing this kind of humourous.Recommended for historical fiction and royalty fans ! ",3
"i love jean 's first person narrative create a style were you feel you understand the character point of view.you understand her relationship with her fatherbrothersister and stepmothers.her longing to no her mother . ",4
"I 'm a big fan of Jean Plaidy 's novels . This book provides a thorough look at The virgin queen She did n't shy away from pointing out Elizabeth 's flaws which as a fiction writer she had some liberty with . Though Elizabeth 's pattern of surrounding herself with young male courtiers and being notoriously jealous of other women is factually known I think Plaidy nails it here and maintains a balance between portraying a strong female who was ahead of her time and knew that marriage would mean giving up her control but also one who is vain jealous and attention seeking.Though Elizabeth was not tyrannical like her father she does share his abilities of self delusion desperately trying to hang onto their youth and reliving their glory days . I found her behavior towards Lettice Knollys both hypocritical and unreasonable and a far cry from trailblazing queen you learn about in history class . Plaidy provides a complete thorough portrait in contrast to the Elizabeth inThe Virgin 's Lover Boleynwho I found needy and gullible . ",3
"I have always loved James Herbert 's books and although I have read this book before reading it again reminded me why I adore this man 's books . The build up of wrongness creates a tension where you feel as if you can shout at the characters to turn around something bad is coming but yet you take every step with them . I love the character of Ash the turmoil within him which makes the story so much more scarier . The author 's ability to describe so vividly a place or situation where you can actually picture it your mind the classroom for example is another reason why I enjoy his books . As with the first time I absolutely enjoyed and loved reading the book again . ",3
"The Ghosts of Sleath is what I would call a true horror novel . It covers everything that most horror fans could wish for including but in no way limited to violence the unknown zombies murder a very descriptive sex scene rape you name it . Oh and it also contains ghosts obviously . To me the most enjoyable thing about this novel was the way it did not let the reader know what was going on too soon . I love the unknown factor in horror novels when they use it but usually you find out that the book is about zombies vampires some monster a restless spirit or just some guy who hates barking dogs right in the beginning . If you like these kinds of books where half the plot is given away on the back of the book and most of the rest by the cover you may not enjoy this horror masterpiece by James Herbert . I can easily say that this is my favorite Herbert novel so far some how managing to beat out The Fog and Domain . Some details from other Herbert novels make an appearance here as well . David Ash returns in this far superior sequel to Haunted to smoke a lot and drink Vodka and to attempt to do his job . Thick impenetrable fog is in the book rats and even the word portent . Maybe I am reading into this a bit much but I like when authors mention their other works because of Stephen King 's habit of doing so.Over all a viciously terrifying book one that I actually stopped reading one night because it got to me so much . I have read hundreds of horror novels and maybe one out of every hundred scares me now . The Ghosts of Sleath has that great honor and I ca n't thank it and its author enough for it . I will end this with a visual . If you know what a jack plane is imagine a crazed carpenter using it on a helpless nineteenyearold boy 's face after beating him horribly with a heavy wooden mallet . If you do n't know what a jack plane is several tool purchasing sites should assist you and ultimately convince you to read this horror gem ",4
"I read this novel many years ago but ordered it to read it again . James Herbert is a master storyteller and a very scary one . Who are the ghosts and what do they want ? Just as importantly what is the cost of finding out . Follow David Ash in his paranormal investigation and be involved in a convoluted tale of a town with a horrifying past that has come back to haunt and to collect its dues . Be frightened be horrified and be utterly aghast as the climax exacts its toll not only on the town and the investigator but also on the reader . ",4
"This is the first of James Herbert 's stories that I have read . It 's a shame he died last March because he probably had a lot more stories in him . The Ghosts of Sleath manages to hold your attention and draw you in to the story pretty quickly . The main character David Ash is likeable enough and his confusion about what is going on in the little town of Sleath is very believable . The main female character with whom he falls in lust is less believable and less likable . All in all the story moves along quickly and Ash 's attempt to figure out what is happening is believable . The ending with it 's explanation of what has prompted all the ghostly sightings is pretty farfetched but what would you expect in a ghost story ? A good summertime read . ",3
"As a horrorghost story 'The Ghosts of Sleath ' is pretty good.As another entry in the apparently ongoing saga of David Ash it'sokay.Overall the book is worth reading but not spectacular and it falls somewhat short of the promise of the first few chapters.Herbert actually addressed some of the problems with 'Haunted ' and fixed them here except he overcompensated.While 'Haunted ' did n't have very many characters or too much action since it was leading up to a big 'surprise revelation ' at the end 'Sleath ' becomes overcrowded with supporting players as we see the haunting of the town from from the perspectives of various residents . This approach worked well for Stephen King in some of his epic novelsand even for Herbert in 'The Rats ' and 'The Fog ' among others but for some reason it did n't 'click ' with me when Herbert tried it here . Most of the characters were a bit 'off ' or 'weird ' to start with so I did n't get that sense of sympathy for 'regular people ' caught up in weird situations with the exception of Ellen Preddle.Herbert is often praised for his descriptiveness as well as his ability to write 'gore ' . I felt that he overdid both of those aspects here.The passages mentioning child abuse are downright uncomfortable to read while even the gore loses its shock value because there 's so much of it.In addition some of the scarier moments as well as even the 'down to earth ' passages are simply TOO long and 'rambling'.There was one scene in 'Haunted ' where a character rambles on in a 'north country ' accent for a couple of pages . Herbert removed almost all traces of 'rural ' speech patterns here and while I did n't mind it in the previous book I thought it would have made the dialogue in 'Sleath ' a bit more believable.Ultimately 'Sleath ' falls short of classic status because Herbert just tried to cram too much into the story . It felt like there was too much going on and too many characters to keep track ofespecially in the later chapters . The 'mysterious fog ' sequences were too reminiscent of Herbert 's earlier work 'The Fog'suggesting that he was running out of ideas.Also when a very minor chracter is reintroduced into the story later on and the author has to remind us of who that character is and where we last saw him it 's not a good sign . Unfortunately Herbert does this twice at crucial points.While there 's usually something to be said for paying close attention to the text and keeping track of characters and plot developments Herbert 's pace alternating between languid and frantic makes it hard to keep track of absolutely everything.There are more than a few passages that readers may find themselves skimming over simply because they 've got the gist of the details and Herbert is only repeating himself . This novel often reads as if he was paid by the word.Finally some thoughts on David Ash While there is some development of his character and a few moments recalling 'Haunted ' I just did n't find him to be a very likable or charismatic character . He sounded a little too much like any other 'cynical English bloke ' so often found in stories like this . His personality was a bit bland even considering all he 'd been through and his few attempts and black humor were so perfunctory Herbert should have just skipped them . I like the idea of the 'Psychical Research Institute ' and would like to see more of itbut I 'm not sure if David Ash should be the focus of any more stories..unless Herbert decides to actually do something with the 'personalworking relationship ' between David and Kate.If not then just do away with Ash and let someone else from the 'Institute ' encounter HIS ghost !

"'48 is as about as action packed as you can get . It starts off running and never really stops the book is almost exhausting to read.The plot is pure bmovie pulp . Hitler uses an unstable chemical weapon that ala The Andromeda Strain turns blood to dusty clots in the veins of victims . Too bad it spreads and kills everyone in the world except for a lucky few . The luckiest of the dead died quick in a matter of minutes . But some live on clots slowly forming throughout their bloodstream and causing gangrene and other nasty and terribly slow ways to die . It is from these last few and quite insane hangers on that our mixed bag of immune heroes must alternate between fleeing and fighting.Most of the novel uses plot points taken from either the cult classic Mad Max or the cheese classic The Omega Man . It 's a quick enough read that is easy to forget . Mr. Herbert may have written far better books but this one is as about as exciting as a plate of literary whipped cream can get . Recommended to those looking for light fast paced and exciting reading . ",2
"_'48_ is the sort of book James Herbet writes better than anyone . It 's not a classic by any means but this is a lean mean novel which reminded me again why I was attracted to Herbert 's novels in the first place . More than half of the book consists of extended chase scenes with economical descriptions and welldefined characters . Plenty of twists and turns in a plot reminiscent of the film _The Omega Man_ adapted from Richard Matheson 's _I Am Legend_ . Definitely recommended for fans of James Herbert 's earlier novels like _The Rats_ and _The Fog_ . ",3
"I 've nearly read everything by James Herbert and I have to say he writes a lot of bad books . And a lot of average books . And some rare really good books . This one belongs in the middlefield.The story sounds interesting but he does n't make anything of it really . The war scenario is also useless . Even the title sounds sooo interesting but in the end well is has some suspense but it 's pulp suspense with no real content.This is fastread stuff . Okay but time can be better spent . ",1
"I had to read this book as well as The Haunted after watching the movie on which both novels are evidently based . I 'm often amazed when a movie is better than the books . And in this case the movie was far superior ! In writing in plot and pacing the movie outstrips the books in a way that the author probably finds offensive.Do not waste precious time on these novels rent the movie instead . If you must read a suspense novel particularly a british one read a great one ! I recommend anything by Phil Rickman who is phenomenal to say the very least . ",1
"Unfortunately Herbert somehow fails to capture the imagination in The Ghosts of Sleath as much as he does in most of his other books . The story centres around psychic investigator David Ash who delves into mysterious events that are terrorizing the community of Sleath where he comes across a dark character called Phelan . Though the premise of the book is sound and though there are solid descriptions somehow Herbert does n't quite capture the imagination . Maybe it 's that word ` solid ' that gives the clue.None of Herbert 's books could be called weak and I 'd like to give this one threeandahalf stars but The Ghosts of Sleath does n't quite come up to the spendid pagegripping terror that this author is well capable of . Do n't let that put you off either this book or James Herbert because it 's still darn good reading . ",2
"Herbert gets an extra star because he clearly spent a lot of time researching war time London . However the good research was n't nearly enough to save this novel . The premise of the book is that at the end of the second world war the nazis released some kind of virus that wiped out most of the world population rather than admitting defeat . The problems are as follows1 . He used a noirish tone for his characters but it was n't well done and instead of stylish it just came across as badly written.2 . The constant action scenes were better suited to a bad film than a bad novel.3 . The characters were cardboard cutouts and their actions in relation to each other made very little sense at all.Total summation Skip this one . ",1
"James Herbert 's '48 is a good example of the lastmanonearth theme that has been growing in creativity and gore in recent years compare 2004 's Dawn of the Dead or Resident Evil to 1978 's The Omega Man for a rather graphic representation of this progression . Set in postWorldWarII London this book is the story of a small band of survivors struggling to flee the evil destructive blackshirts in a world decimated by Hitler 's lastditch desparate horrific attack . The B2 bombs warheads filled with a devastating virus called the blood death have wiped out nearly all of the world 's population . The only survivors are those with the extremely rare ABnegative blood type and a handful of other less fortunate souls who survived the initial attack but are slowly dying from the blood disease nonetheless.The story starts with an immediate pulsepounding chase scene as the protagonist Hoch is pursued through the London 's empty streets by a gang of murderous thugs loyal to Hitler 's ideals and infected with the blood death . Their only hope for longterm survival is to capture Hoch and drain him of his healthy blood then attempt a transfusion.We follow Hoch down into the tunnels of London 's Underground into lavish hotel halls and eventually to the top of the Tower Bridge where he engineers a final standoff with the blackshirts who want his blood . Along the way Hoch encounters a few other healthy individuals . One of them Muriel becomes a love interest in two drawnout and unfortunately quite graphic sex scenes . Another a German named Wilhelm Sterne becomes the focus of Hoch 's hatred in a series of characterdevelopment scenes that add surprising depth to the otherwise actionbased plot.The body count in '48 is unknowable . Beyond the initial deaths of billions of people worldwide due to the blood death Hoch singlehandedly kills hundreds of blackshirts during the course of the story . In one brief but nonetheless disturbing scene shown in a flashback Hoch runs over an insane man in the street for no reason other than the fact that the man is in his way . Hoch 's female companions continually entreat him to spare the lives of his enemies Has n't there been enough killing ? is a common refrain from these characters but Herbert 's protagonist is unaffected by their pleas.This is a dark story that ends without imparting much hope for the future . It is without question entertainingthe rapidity of the plot and the wellwritten scenes of nonstop action see to thatand the characters are multilayered and for the most part believable . The book accomplishes exactly what it sets out to accomplish . However due to the unoriginality of the story the graphic sexuality and the overwhelming scenes of violence it is not one that I feel can be recommended . ",2
"Review '48Apocalyptic ActionThis story is about an alternate history where the Germans launch a devastating biological attack using V2 rockets . It is in the final days of the war in 1945 and Hitler 's Reich is finished so he launches a virus that very well may kill off humanity . The virus for some reason does not effect people with ABneg blood.Flash forward 3 years and the story begins . The protagonist is an American who came to England as a volunteer fighter pilot to help the war effort . He has been holed up at the Savoy a fancy hotel with his trusted dog companion . Immediately his location is found and he is soon running for his life . The bad guys are called the BlackShirts . They wear you guessed it black shirts and they have the virus and are slowly dying . Yes not all people affected died immediately . The black shirts believe in their fascist leader and his belief that they can survive by performing a blood transfusion from someone who has ABneg blood . The American hero of the story meets up with a few other survivors including an escaped German POW a working class pub girl and a upper class previously rich girl.The rest of the story is mostly boredom as they hole up somewhere and you are told in great detail the layout of the room and given detailed tedious descriptions of every piece of furniture and item in sight followed by being discovered and running and action and shooting and so on . I 'm not impressed at all by this book . Because I like apocalyptic fiction I refrained from giving it only one star since the idea is not bad . ",1
"Here 's the run down You 've got a emotionally compromised psychic investigator who has been sent to an intellectually compromised town . He 's heard creepy stuff has been happening and he 's a scientist sent to do his thing . He does everything but behave like one however.To give him credit 'ol Herb the author did have some suspense going . But as I was turning the pages I was grimacing to find out what was next . There was an exceedingly large portion of icky violent scenes . And by ick I mean things being ripped off oozing down cracking apart etc etc Another con would be the psychiclink romance quotient Yeah who 'd a thought . ",1
"As a kid I always classified Dean Koontz as the 'suspense ' guy Stephen King the 'scary ' guy and Herbert the 'sex and gore ' guy . I loved his stuff screwing in the woods one minute guts being eaten by rats the next . I 've not read him in 20 years however and was drawn to '48 by a dust jacket that seemed to promise a pretty interesting scenario . Unfortunately the scenario is all this terrible book has to recommend it.I do n't know if Herbert was just having a very bad day or if his writing has always been this bad . The 'story ' what little there is consists of being chased getting caught being chased again then winning no suspense no twists and turns no suprises no excitement no gore no sex . I would never have belived that my beloved James Herbert could have written a boring book but with '48 he 's managed it . In addition to such sins he writes from the first person perspective of an American GI while failing to find a remotely believable American voice for him.On a seperate note Herbert really needs to get himself another editor . '48 contains more typos than any book I 've ever read from a mainsteam publisher . For example That suited me line the back of Iris head hit the floor the husband was sewing in the forces creeping Up on us a dent in Iris twisted logic.A grave dissappointment from a childhood favorite .

"What if in 1948 in the final phase of World War 2 a biological weapon was released ? After all such ` wonder weapons ' were really in development buy both Britain and Germany . And what if as a result virtually all of the population of Britain were killed in one catastrophic day ? Only a few the partially immune survive for a while and even fewer the naturally immune live on untouched at least by disease . What would life then be like in 1948 ? Thus the novel 's title.As you can see this is an alternate history and so technically is science fiction . James Herbert usually writes horror but this effort is definitely not second rate as a result . Herbert is Britain 's No.1 bestselling writer of chiller fiction a position he has held since the publication of his first novel . & lt'48 > p.1 Herbert 's novels have sold over fortytwo million copies . WikipediaHoke the main character and firstpersonnarrator is a US pilot who joined the British air force before his country joined the war . He is a hardboiled character who is embittered by his experiences before and after the war . The novel itself is thus also hard boiled and the reader is propelled headlong through it accompanying Hoke in a series of chases and fights . Herbert reveals himself to be a master of tension with cliffhanger chapter ending and surprise plot twists . There is one steamy sex scene though it would only offend the most conservative of readers.A novel could hardly be written about 1948 without Fascism being mentioned and indeed it is furnished with a band of British Nazis to serve as foe . The novel is most ` pat ' on this issue but then Hitler really did make those now comic speeches complete with huge rhetorical gestures and frenzied shouted deliveries . Considerable depth is given to the contemplation of this topic by the inclusion of the character of Wilhelm Stern . Stern was involved in the war but he at least & ltseems > to be a decent person . Hoke 's reaction to Stern is driven by a wild kind of hatred . Hoke sees Stern through the eyes of propaganda . Childishly he can not even stand the German 's pronunciation of v for w as in Vilhelm.Class is another theme covered by the novel . Hoke and Cissie another British survivor are both lower class but Hoke admires the British upper class ' stiff upper lip . At one point the survivors wonder what happened to the Royal Family . But is n't this sort of thing as much a result of propaganda and stereotype as ` evil Germans ' ? Herbert certainly digs deeper than this.The theme of madness is also developed in some depth . Can anyone survive disaster virtually untouched mentally ? Is posttraumatic stress disorder in fact a sane reaction ? Does n't paranoid caution have survival value ? As we have seen from his reaction to Stern Hoke is touched by a kind of madness.Despite the ` pat ' appearance of the hard boiled style Herbert has constructed his characters with some depth . Hoke is very interesting . As we have hinted his judgements should not all necessarily be trusted . This ambiguity makes the reader think rather than the author doing all the thinking for him . Muriel an upper class survivor is the stereotyped weeping floosy clinging to the neck of the capable hero but we should remember that in the era virtually no women worked and at least some were a product of social pressure which told them that they were exactly that weak and in need of a man . Cissie is much more a determined woman feisty and willing to stand up to Hoke . Modern female readers will like this character.This novel gets a rare 5 stars from me because it is both exciting and thematically rich . The characterization is excellent and the style is intriguing and emotionally engaging . Herbert manages to be both ` popular ' and deep no easy feat . There is something in here for many different types of people even the history enthusiast . & lt ` 48 > is well worth the price . ",4
"The very first time I stumbled upon James HerbertI read his novel Nobody true and was thrilled enough to give him chance several more times although nothing ever matched that first excitement in factI noticed a certain sameness in his work so approached 48 with cautionready to give up upon first negative character who happens to be big fat woman menacing the world . To my biggest surprisethis one turned out to be gripping read in factaction is happening so fast that I did n't have time to think about boredomrepeating or cliches I was pulled on into never ending run through tunnels full of waterbombs falling on decrepit buildingsstreets full of dead bodies and so onreally post apocalyptic world.Sureit is obvious rethinking of Omega Man and 28 days later but it 's fine by meI like apocalyptic worlds and one survivor fighting bad guys . This time Herbert sets his story in post WW2 Europe where germans have infected the whole world with some deadly virus and only handful survivors is left to fight proNazi army who is searching for fresh blood literary . The main hero is american pilot Hoke and if he is not exactly nice character the story around him is interesting enough to keep you reading long into the night.Interesting device at the end of each chapterHerbert introduces new twist in the story so it keeps you hooked and reader is pulled into next chapter .

"I suggest that you first read Haunted also written by Mr Herbert before reading this book . It really would clarify a lot of things concerning Juliet the protagonist 's sister and what happened to him at Edbrook . Both books revolve around David Ash 's investigations and what happens to him in Haunted is constantly being referred to in this book so much so that it actually becomes part of his character.In THE GHOSTS OF SLEATH we 're introduced to the once tranquil village called Sleath . Once tranquil only but NOT solely because a boy named Simon showed up . Yes the same Simon who was just buried ! Ghosts do not exist ? David Ash works as a psychic investigator for the Psychical Research Institute . He has just completed his investigation in the 'mysterious ' Bonadventure case and is immediately given another assignment . . .Ghosts do not exist ? . . .Sleath .

"It seems that '48 was a huge let down for the vast majority of people that have given their reviews here . Although it seems that Majority Rules would be speaking volumes in this instance decrying the book as nothing more than pulp I want to offer a more balanced opinion.Firstly James Herbert is a master of horror fiction he has always had a great ability to write with an immeadiacy that quickly pulls the reader into his world . Notice how even though many people critisized the book the resounding agreement was that '48 was an action packed fast paced read . A curious oxymoron since many great reviews of populist fiction will often include the words fast paced a page turner nonstop action . How did these reviewers turn these comments into negatives ? ! ! Approaching '48 as an example from the Horror genre is the first mistake when reading this book . It 's clear to me that the tone of '48 is dervived from the Boy 's Own style of actionadventure stories popular in the era in which the book was set . Kudos then need to be payed to Mr Herbert for deciding to write a period piece in the style of popular fiction from the period it illustrates . On that level it was clearly a resounding success . '48 is without a doubt an exceptionally visceral novel . It does n't make any claims to be of any social relevance or offer any intellectual or political dogma . It is just a story created to offer high level low brow entertainment something you can pick up and throw yourself into on a rainy afternoon.In cinematic terms sometimes you feel like watching Schindlers List . sometimes you feel like watching Die Hard with a Vengeance . In this case '48 is a Die Hard . I loved it . ",3
"This book was one that I did n't think I would enjoy Enjoy is perhaps the wrong word . I was held spell bound to the pages . James Herbert creates such an atmosphere that you feel you are actually in the story . I must say it had me looking up at every creak and groan my house made . It is a long time since I have felt quite so scared and I must admit that I did get scared . A book that holds you right to the finish and it is an unexpected ending . This book is an A grade thriller . ",3

"This scifihorrorthriller page turner from James Herbert takes place obviously enough in 1948 after the allies have lost the second world war in ravaged London . Due to one of Hitler 's biological devices the vast majority of the citizenry have been killed while only those with the extremely rare AB blood type have been spared and a slightly larger minority have been condemned to a slow lingering death.The main character Hoke is one of the fortunate few that has been spared the disease and he spends a good deal of his time fleeing those who are dying the slow death they are attempting to capture him to steal his blood and in theory his immunity to the disease through a transfusion . Along the way he meets a few other survivors and of course races towards a final showdown with his pursuers.By no means a deep meaningful or socially conscious novel '48 simply offers vivid scenery and top notch entertainment and I was completely incapable of putting it down . I stayed up till 4AM to finish it It 's nonstop action from cover to cover and its the perfect answer for an otherwise quiet evening . Do n't listen to all the negative reviews because in terms of sheer entertainment value this book is quality . Enjoy . ",3

"Interesting book that does a good job of blending stories from the English and German sides of the fighting in North Africa . We learn quite a bit about the planes the Brits flew but less so about their German counterparts . Like the way the stories of two officers one a courageous bright and adventuresome Brit and the other a cool erudite German major . Story line is well developed as are most of the characters . The Italian doctor is very appealing and steals part of the book.While we learn quite a bit about the Brits and Germans in North Africa little of interest is provided about the role of Americans in the Cactus Air Force of North Africa.Overall this a quick and enjoyable read .

"and I do n't say that lightly . I think Robinson 's PIECE OF CAKE is flatout one of the best books I 've ever read and as this book was billed as a sortof sequel I was all too eager to lay my mitts on it . Now I wish I had n't bothered . Here 's why.CAKE It followed the lives of the men of the Royal Air Force 's Hornet Squadron over a period of twelve months from the outbreak of the war until the climax of the Battle of Britain . Because a lot of nothing happened during the first six months of World War II we were able to get to know the pilots quite well and thus were emotionally invested in their fates not to mention engrossed in how the strain of combat flying and command responsibility changed them . CAKE was many things a great story a beautifully written account of aerial battle a superb if not very flattering psychological study of fighter pilots and a supremely cynical and ironic look at the overglorified Battle of Britain . In short it was a masterpeice not in the least because it produced so many memorable characters Moggy Cattermole Lord Rex CH3 Flash Gordon Uncle Kellaway Skull Skelton et al but in the main because it was a patient oaksolid piece of storytelling.A GOOD CLEAN FIGHT is a very different sort of book and it is not a case of viva la difference . It is set in 1942 in the North African desert about two years after the end of CAKE and it involves four distinct storylines involving1 . Jack Lampard an SAS commando who raids German airfields2 . Paul Schramm a Luftwaffe intel officer with a grudge against Lampard3 . Fanny Barton CO of Hornet Squadron who is in danger of being grounded because his squadron is n't racking up kills4 . Henry Lester an American reporter in Egypt looking for a scoop.And herein lays the first problem . Robinson has too many stories to tell . This could have been a quite remarkable novel about the dirty side of a supposedly clean fight if he had just stuck to 1 and 2 that is the catandmouse struggle between the reckless gloryhound Lampard and the troubled cynic Schramm . Because in fact Robinson 's depiction of how the SAS operated not just technically but psychologically is masterful as are his descriptions of the desert itself . I would have preferred Hornet Squadron not be included in the story at all since its presence was n't really necessary and since Robinson does n't handle it with anywhere near the aplomb or respect of CAKE . Firstly though we get five characters from that book Baggy Bletchley Fanny Barton Pip Patterson Uncle Kellaway and Skull Skelton there is no real emotional connection with any of them and certainly not with each other . Barton in particular has changed out of recognition and Robinson makes no attempt to put us in his head and explain how he has transformed in two years from a conscientious leader into a neartotal psychopath one willing to see every one of his men killed just so he can stay the leader of Hornet . There 's an odd unpleasant coldness to the scenes with our old Hornet friends a sense of a reunion nobody wanted or needed that everyone wishes would end as quickly as possible and then be forgotten . For me that was a huge disappointment . I 'd always wanted to know what happened to these guys and we never do find out what became of CH3 or Mother Cox by the bye but as I said before now that I know I wish I did n't . I have n't felt such distaste with the way characters were handled in a sequel since HANNIBAL . As for the Lester story it was quite purely and simply unnecessary . Pointless bumf as Rex would say.The fourlayered structure of the novel detracts from it in other ways . The new characters in Hornet not having the time or space to become distinct from each other take on the appearance of cannonfodder . They are introduced and killed off as fast as the interchangable teenagers of a FRIDAY THE 13th movie leaving no particular impression on the reader . Had Robinson devoted the whole book or a separate book to Hornet these unfortunates might have had time to develop into the same type of hauntingly real people as CAKE 's Fitz Fitzgerald or Squadron Leader Ramsay . Alas no . Hornet is here but the essence of Hornet is not . Furthermore there are signs everywhere in the writing that Robinson was not trying his hardest not bringing his A game to the typewriter . For example in PIECE OF CAKE there is a character named Daddy Dalgliesh . In A GOOD CLEAN FIGHT there is a character named Pinky Dalgleish . In P.O.C . there is an American assigned to Hornet Squadron named Hart in A.G.C.F . there is an American assigned to Hornet Squadron named Hooper . The character of Baggy Bletchley who was killed in the previous book shows up alive in this one no explanation . Bits and pieces of squadronroom banter are recycled and small errors are made which led me to believe Robinson did n't reread PIECE OF CAKE before he started A GOOD CLEAN FIGHT . For example Moggy Cattermole is mentioned having been killed by friendly fire when in fact he was killed by Germans . Uncle Kellaway is described as disliking whiskey when in the previous book he fantasizes about drinking it at the end of a hard day . Fanny Barton is described as having black eyebrows when in fact he is platinum blond . I realize these things individually do n't mean much but collectively I found them jarring and annoying . I loved these characters and I did n't want to see them carelessly handled . And anyone who does n't think they were should reread the this is what happened to bit at the end . Embarrassing.I could go on but you get the point . Having created the iconic Hornet Squadron Robinson should have been very jealous of how or even if it should ever appear again . Instead I was left with the feeling he just traded on its good name to deliver a sequel which is really nothing more than a depressing cameo appearance . ",2
"Honestly this is a second rate novel but if you have read the author 's brilliant World War One Trilogy and his World War Two epic Piece of Cake this book is bound to seem derivative . It tells several different stories of World War Two in North Africa from British German and Italian perspective . The story telling is linear the technical details excellent but it seems a little rote and not nearly as biting as his WWI novels of the air war.I am a huge fan of Robinson 's writing and would read a roll of toilet paper authored by him but read the other novels I have suggested first and if his twisted view of the joy and despair of war gets its grip on you then you can come to this later when you will understand his unique talents . ",4
"I 've read everything Mr. Robinson has written and for me this is without a doubt my favorite story . Dark funny and full of grisly action it transports the reader in to the bleak desert war in North Africa . I 've read this story more times that I care to tell and will read it a dozen more time before I die . I love this book and I want everyone I know to read it . ",4
"Derek Robinson 's novel A Good Clean Fight follows the remaining characters from his earlier Piece of Cake to the North African Desert in May 1942 . As in previous Robinson novels much of the focus is upon the fictional Hornet Squadron now led by Fanny Barton and equipped with P40 Tomahawks . The pilot Pip Patterson the squadron adjutant Uncle Kellaway and the intelligence officer Skull Skelton are also on hand . However unlike other Robinson novels that focus mainly on life within the squadron A Good Clean Fight has substantial roles for the Germans and for a British ground unit . Captain Jack Lampard is a British Special Air Service SAS officer who leads daring behindthelines raids on German airfields and Major Paul Schramm is a German intelligence officer tasked with finding and defeating the SAS raiders . There are also a number of other SAS and German supporting characters that add depth to Lampard 's and Schramm 's roles . A Good Clean Fight also has considerably more combat action than any other Robinson novels and the book crackles along at a very good pace . Indeed the novel starts off very well and could have been a truly great war novel if Robinson had not allowed himself to get distracted with several unnecessary subplots in the middle of his work . Nevertheless A Good Clean Fight is very good and probably one of Robinson 's finest efforts to date.The main plot with Hornet Squadron in A Good Clean Fight focuses on efforts to entice the Luftwaffe fighters to come up and fight in the quiet period that preceded the Gazala Campaign . Barton afraid that his hardluck unit might be broken up offers to conduct a systematic ground attack program in order to get the German fighters to commit to action the Germans preferred to hold their fighters back in order to prepare for the main battle coming . In effect Barton commits his unit to an attritional campaign that can have but one end for the squadron whittling down pilots and aircraft in the hope that something will break loose before the unit is combat ineffective . Barton has changed somewhat since A Piece of Cake and is no longer very sympathetic many readers might feel that he is sacrificing his unit for his own sake but that is unfair . Fanny 's efforts to outfox the enemy as he says and Skull 's pointed explanations of why this is unlikely are quite interesting . In the midst of this growing tension in the unit Robinson delivers several excellent and exciting descriptions of airground attacks on assorted targets.Lampard begins the novel with an exciting raid on a German airfield and even briefly captures the intelligence officer Schramm . Robinson 's depiction of these raids gives great insight not only into SAS tactics of the period but the type of men who excelled in this type of work . Lampard in many respects is the SAS leader par excellence aggressive physically impressive cunning and ultracompetent . Unfortunately Lampard has some flaws which may not be uncommon in the special operations community he is a risk junkie who does n't know when to quit and he lies to superiors and subordinates in order to cover up his mistakes . Like Barton 's attrition tactics Lampard 's risk tactics seem preordained to eventual catastrophe of course with much bravery along the way.Schramm starts out as a very interesting witty character but gradually withers into a sour introverted pathetic sort . While Schramm and his peers do provide some tension in the novel with their cat and mouse game with Lampard one feels that the SAS are never seriously threatened by Luftwaffe intelligence . Indeed the one German effort to send a large patrol out into the desert to ambush the incoming SAS patrols ends up in total and ridiculous disaster . The worst parts of the novel involve Schraam 's involvement with an Italian female doctor this goes nowhere and means nothing . On the Allied side the antics of two reporters is also quite distracting and useless . Were it not for these distracting minor characters who somehow elbow out the main characters in midstream A Good Clean Fight would have been nearly perfect.As usual Robinson 's humor is very dry and very dark and is certainly the most compelling aspect of his novels . Robinson is able to show both the bravery and the stupidity in war as well as just the sheer misery of trying to fight in blastfurnace heat covered with flies . In a historical sense Robinson also delivers insight into neglected facets of the desert war such as the Takoradi trail the Allies used to ferry planes across Africa and the German air raid on Chad to interdict the trail . ",4
"Usually enjoy Derek Robinson 's books but this one I was quite disappointed withhad the tendency to even miss a page and still not lose any of the story ",1
"Although A GOOD CLEAN FIGHT shares some characters in common with an earlier book PIECE OF CAKE and it 's also about the fictional Hornet squadron it 's not a sequel in the traditional sense . A sequel implies a certain safety the security of routine Biggles Sharpe Hornblower . With Robinson 's books there is no such thing as safety or security . The only thing predictable about this book is that it is just as riveting and blackly funny as any of his other novels.There is a very large cast of characters occupying North Africa in the spring of 1942 in a lull between battles when the two armies German and British are eyeing each other across the desert and waiting for something to happen . Fanny Barton leader of Hornet squadron and survivor of the Battle of Britain needs to get some results or else he 'll be taken off ops reassigned to ferry brandnew airplanes across Africa . He hatches a plan to strafe German camps and ammo dumps and whatever other targets he can lay his hands on even if it means leading his squadron of clappedout Tomahawks to the brink of destruction.Jack Lampard a captain in the SAS has a similar motivation . He 's the sort of man only suited to life during wartime anything less than a lifeordeath adventure preferably in the desert with a good chance of having one 's head blown off by a German sentry is not worth it . He leads commando raids on German airfields driving his patrol through the desert behind enemy lines and striking at night . He gets results but he also gets addicted to danger his men can see that Lampard does n't plan on coming back from their latest raid . An American reporter comes along for the ride looking for a hero to sell his newspapers.Paul Schramm is a Luftwaffe intelligence officer determined to find some way of combating the SAS raids . He 's fortyfour walks with a limp and knows he 's no killer but he 's had a taste of action and he wants more . He struggles with these impulses War does n't use brains . War replaces brains . There 's no such thing as intelligent violence . Major Jakowski of the Afrika Korps comes up with a scheme of his own to outfox the SAS patrols by leading a force into the desert to intercept them . The result is about as effective as Don Quixote tilting at windmills I expect they were up to no good just like us Lampard says The difference is we 're rather better at it are n't we ? The characters are sketched in quick deft strokes you recognize them and empathize with them even though they might only hang around for a few pages even if they 're not the sort of people you 'd like to know . Dialogue is one of Robinson 's strengths and he is on top form here . He describes the desert with a remarkable intensity flies heat sun sand flies spectacular sunsets dust more flies everything comes to life with a harsh vividness that is second only to the real thing . The action scenes are equally graphic sparing no details . They are as emotionally gripping as they are thrilling.Mr . Robinson has written some fantastic books . A GOOD CLEAN FIGHT is probably not his masterpiece but it is the widest in scope and perhaps the most lucid in its depiction of the bravery futility and utter absurdity of war . ",4
"I enjoy Robinson 's style and his unwavering desire to keep the facts accurate . I have read several personal accounts of the air action in the desert war and they are certainly in tune with his efforts . Having read little about the ground actions in the desert I can not attest as to the accuracy of his account of the LRDGSAS efforts but I am sure they are as accurate as the rest of his works . ",3
"I just started reading this author and was looking for another in the series . Being a UK author I was glad to find him on Amazon . The book arrived quickly and in good shape . Note the UK book sizes are a bit taller than US paperbacks so you may need to adjust shelf sizes . ",4
"I read a couple of Robinson 's WW1 novels and was n't impressed but this book and Piece OF Cake are in a league of their own . Highly recommended you 'll never romanticize the air war again ! ",4
"Manyou have to read this book . It 's incredible ! ! This book has everything a great book should have . Interesting char plot twists and a writing style that holds the readers attention.When it comes to char 's they have to be interesting . For the good guys Alex Cross has what it takes . Smarts courage and is never willing to give up . He has to get back two children that were taken my the master criminal Gary Soneji . The reader ca n't help but to be drawn to Cross.For the bad guys the reader has to be drawn to themand you 'll be drawn to Gary Soneji . Throught the powerful writing style of Patterson the reader will get into Soneji 's head and see what makes him tick . We are exposed to his backgroud and see what has happned to Soneji as a child to shape the monster that he is . When you read about Soneji 's childhood the reader ca n't help but to feel sympathy.Patterson has a writing style that will keep the reader guessing what will happen next right up the the last page . There are so many plot twists in ALONG CAME A SPIDER it will keep you on the edge of your seat.If you saw the movie and liked it then I highly suggest you run not walk to the nearest bookstore and get this book . I liked the movie but loved this book . Do yourself the favor and pick it up . You wo n't be sorry . ",4
"This book was a slam dunk . I am glad it was the first Patterson featuring Cross book that I read because it set up a lot of things that might have seemed odd or inconsequential later . Now that I have read all the books in the series I rank this one and KISS THE GIRLS as his two best.Much has already been said by others about the thrilling plot the surprises and etc . so I will focus on two aspects of the book that have remained with me long after reading . The first is the deft insertion of social commentary in the book . When I first read the book I thought James Patterson was African American and I mean that as a compliment . He became Alex Cross and Alex Cross is a black man with real life black man problems aside from solving serial killings . His family is authentic his associations with black and white people his romances with white and black women without being condescending cute or stereotypicalI should maybe write more about this category it was handled so well without making Cross a whitegirl chasing Tom despite his affair with Jezzie good job good job good Job Mr. Patterson his reluctance to be pulled off a case involving working class blacks to solve one involving elite whites . In short his attitudes about things is not typically black but typically Alex Cross who happens to be black . Get it ? He is real first . And he is black second.The second aspect that burns long after consumption is SonejiMurphy as a husband and father in suburbia . There is humor humanity and lurking danger in these scenes . I kept praying that when he finally snappedwhich I suspected was coming and boy was I rightthat he would n't hurt his daughter . Patterson pulls no punches and reading these scenes I began to buy why a man with such a regular looking life dull normal life might secretly be a serial killer . Just looking for fun . OK that 's sort of a simplistic assesment of SonejiMurphy 's particular psychosis and to understand him better we would probably have to consider what we know about his Freudian footnoted childhood on his grandfather 's farm and whatnot . Nevertheless SonejiMurphy is scary BECAUSE he is looking for fun on some level . ",4
"A U.S . Senator 's daughter is kidnapped from a tony upperclass private school in Washington D.C. Dr. Alex Cross Morgan Freeman becomes involved in the case when the perpetrator plants some evidence in his mailbox . Dr. Cross teams up with a beautiful Secret Service agent Monica Potter who was working on a security detail at the private school to look over the welfare of another student the son of the Russian President . Together these two crime fighters piece together clues that apparently point to a highly intellectual and challenging criminal oppenent Gary Soneji played by Michael Wincott.This movie is being marketed as a kind of prequel to the movie Kiss The Girls starring Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman who played Dr. Cross a retired forensic detective who is called on a difficult case to track the whereabout of a Congessman 's daughter who was kidnapped by a sexual predator . Morgan Freeman also starred as a criminal detective in David Fincher 's film Seven also starring Brad Pitt and it seems that he has found an acting role that many find appealing playing a quiet extremely thoughtful criminal profiler a kind of modern day Sherlock Holmes.That being said Along Came a Spider looked like a promising thriller but it turns into an ugly mess in a very short time . Almost every hunch that Dr. Cross ponders turns out to be correct . Almost everytime the kidnapper is cornered red herrings something used to confuse the viewer and turn the attention away from the basic issue are thrown out.As the movie chugs to its dramatic conclusion any tension that the director worked to produce in the audience evaporates when it becomes obvious that trust was invested in the wrong person . That 's about all that I can say about the surprise ending . Current advertisements for this movie caution those who have seen it to not give the ending away . Yes this movie has a surprise ending although I question that claim and ostensibly the producers of this film want to lure new viewers into the theater by building extra intrigue into the movie ala the famous and longrunning London stage play Mousetrap Agatha Christie 's whodunnit play . ",1
"I 've listened to a couple of his other books on CD but Along Came a Spider was my first read of any of Patterson 's work and my first forary into the Alex Cross series . Outstanding plot and top quality writing Patterson develops plot and characters gradually and continuously throughout this book . Can not wait to read more in this series . ",3
"Patterson is a effective writer Has the ability to keep you spellbound This on keep you wanting to keep on reading to see what happens Go for it ",4
"Great development of characters you begin to feel that you know each very well . Evidence in the cases is well established and bits and items are exposed to allow you to reach conclusions . I find the writing style and story and plot arrangement to be very compelling.I highly recommend this first installment in a series . ",4
"is my favorite character . I have enjoyed this book . It has good story and it keeps reader in expectation what will come . I like books written by Mr. Patterson . ",3
"If the only book you have ever read was the Waikicamucau pop . 13 telephone directory then this would be the secondbest book you ever opened.If you are 9 years old or younger you may find this as exciting as eating spinach . Without salt.If you are sophisticated enough to realise that a story should be credible make sense and entertain you then leave this book on the shelf.There 's a fourletter word it starts with CR and rhymes with PAP . You should know it . It 's extravagant praise for this book.Avoid this book like the plague . Avoid anything written by James patterson like the plague . In fact if you are given a choice take the plague . You 'll feel better . ",0
"I plan on reading all of the Alex Cross novels . Loved this book . Got really involved with the characters . I did n't care so much for the relationship between Alex & JezzieI do n't know why I guess I just was n't sold on the bond . Otherwise great book . ",3
"What I Loved This is the first book in the Alex Cross series and it was a fantastic introduction of the Cross Character . I had seen this movie but I do n't think I had ever read the book . The case was compelling and the twist even though I knew it was coming still kind of caught me off guard . James Patterson truly has a way of sucking you into a story and never quite knowing which way he is going to turn.What I Liked The pacing was a little off in this book but with that in mind I liked how each new element of the book was introduced . I also like how no storyline was dropped and forgotten . It was interesting to read the physical characteristics of the characters because they were a little off from what I thought they would look like so I had to adjust my mental images of the main characters.Complaints NoneMovie Comparison Thoughts Physically I do n't think any of the casting matched the actual characters in the bookthat being said I think everyone did a great job in their roles . I know these are older movies but as thrillers I think they have stood the test of time.Why I gave it a 4 I did n't like it as much as Kiss the Girls I seldom like book 1 in a series as much as the rest of the series but it was still a really good read.Who would I recommend it too ThrillerMystery fans.Author WebsiteBooks in this seriesAlong Came a SpiderKiss the GirlsJack & JillCat & MousePop Goes the WeaselRoses Are RedViolets Are BlueFour Blind MiceThe Big Bad WolfLondon BridgesMary MaryCrossDouble CrossCross CountryI Alex CrossCross Fire ",3

"I think that all fans of detective novels particularly those of a psychological nature will get a big kick out of these eight legs ! James Patterson brilliantly keeps up the tension throughout the novel . As with great stories like this the villain seems unlikely at first but all the clues are there and it all fits ! Detective Alex Cross a hardbitten black cop psychology major from DC is investigating a series of gruesome deaths in the ghettos of Washington when he and his partner get dragged off on a case involving the kidnapping from an exclusive private school of two children . One is the son of the secretary of the treasury the other Maggie Rose is the daughter of a famous movie star . Initially Dr. Cross is annoyed at all the attention being focussed on the privileged but he finds himself getting dragged into the case.It appears that a Gary Soneji a teacher at the school who was so well liked he was named Mr. Chips kidnapped the children out of the blue . As the plot thickens leads seem to connect to the ghetto killings one of the children turns up dead a ransom is paid and lost and the kidnapper proves elusive . Alex Cross vilified for his role in the handing over of the ransom finds solice in the figure of Jezzie Flanagan the prime secret service minder of the two children . The relationship crossing racial boundaries adds more tension.The figure of Gary Soneji the alterego of a Gary Murphy is a brilliant creation up there with the likes of Hannibal Lecter . At least you know where you are with Mr. Lecter MurphySoneji keep you guessing all the way scary ! James Patterson brilliantly handles all of the threads not letting any of them unravel and adding twist after clue after hint . The final unveiling of the villain is wonderful suprising but the clues are all there to find . ",3
"This is James Patterson 's first novel starring his well rounded hero Alex Cross . A brilliant African American detective with a higher moral agenda than your average suspense novel protagonist . In Along Came a Spider we are introduced to Patterson 's seamless blending of first and third person narrative that works so well with a many faceted character such as Alex Cross . This book succeeds on many levels as the villian Gary Soneji is trully vile but not unbelievably so the supporting characters such as Alex 's family are made interesting and revelant to the story and it progresses quickly with twists and turns that lead to a surprisingly emotional ending . Along Came a Spider has a little of everything criminal psychology courtroom drama love murder kidnapping insightful family interaction and the kitchen sink ! This is a smartly written superior book ! ",3
"I gave When the Wind Blows a horrible review and had only read one other book by Patterson which was a terrorist thriller of average quality when I decided to bite the bullet and try this one out.Obviously some people really like his style and stories so I figured this one made into a movie could n't be THAT bad . I was n't too disappointed in fact since I expected it to stink I was actually a bit impressed.If you 're into chick written mystery thrillers then this one will probably appeal to you . I tend to enjoy more meaty offerings Caleb Carr 's great historical murder thrillers come to mind and Scott Turow 's mysteries lawyer based . These types of books really get into the characters and do n't rely so much on the hyper plot with out of the world head line grabbing stories.This book makes the same mistakes that I found in the decent thriller Absolute Power in which stuff happens that really could never happen . I understand that is one of the points of certain types of fiction Blockbuster fiction if you will but it does n't have to be so over the top.In any case this one 's a fairly quick read and not a total let down as for those that give this book the kind of glowing best novel ever type reviews well I do n't believe those people have read much fiction.The cover of the paperback copy I read of this title had a glowing endorsement by Nelson DeMille who is a superb writer I 'd recommend all his books before going to this series but if you 're a quick reader with lots of time I 'm going to give this an okay recommendation . ",2
"Great book and a very good movie . However that being said do n't try to compare the two . I kept waiting for more similarities to the movie . These similarities did n't happen . Well worth reading but I probably would have enjoyed it a LOT more if I had n't seen the movie . I enjoyed the plot and the characters . ",3
"I read this book in the wrong order because I first read Cat and Mouse which is an unbelievably enjoyable novel Read my review so I already had a small idea of what happened in Along came a Spider . I will just say that this novel was like reading two different novels . One was a very intelligent suspenseful mystery about a kidnapping carried out to go right where the Lindbergh kidnapping went wrong . The scenes of Alex Cross trying to find Gary Soneji the court scenes and the conversations between Cross and Gary Murphy are wonderful . This part of the novel gets 5 stars.HoweverI subtract two stars for the unbelievably boring and uninspired romantic twist to the story there was a point where I just decided to skip whole chapters that did n't add anything to the story . I got through the first three hundred pages faster than I did the last two hundred . It was just mesmerizing to think that the same brilliant mind that came up with the suspenseful mystery came up with the other garbage . Do n't get me wrong I do enjoy romance in a mystery novel in fact I think its an important part but Patterson should ask Jeffery Deaver who writes so well about the relationship between Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs or maybe ask Ridley Pearson who does so well with Lou Boldt and Daphne Mathews to give him a few tips on mixing romance with suspense.My reccommendation is read this novel but if the mood starts getting romantic do n't waste your time at least not until the end where the romantic scene is important.Alex Cross is a great character and Gary Soneji is the perfect nemesis I just feel that Patterson did a better job of mixing his romantic chapters with the story in Cat and Mouse than what he was able to accomplish in this novel . ",2
"Once again Patterson keeps turning the pages . You are completely immersed in the story and its characters and boom a curve ball . You are sucked in alongside Alex Cross trying to analyze the psychopaths . ",3
"I had some sleepless nights reading this book . I enjoyed this book so much I had dreams about Cross and him capturing Gary . I would recommend this book to those who would like to read a good mystery . ",4
"I did n't like it honestly . People consider the Alex Cross trilogy thrillers If you call them thrillers at allI just call them straight out slow paced and boring fast paced . They 're not fast paced ! There 's hardly any good action scenes and gun battles no Shoot 'em up lethal weapon stuff which was what I expected yet did n't get it . The only reason that people consider this book fast paced is because of the short chapters . Yeah I admit it there are some very short chapters . Lots . But that does n't mean that it 's fast paced . It 's fast paced compared to Stephen King but I think it 's a slow paced book . I want action . I want adventure . The killer kills a lot of people . I did n't need disgusting and awful as well as dull details that James Patterson gives out . And also Patterson had a good chance to make this a good cop thriller . He failed miserably . I do n't think I 've ever read a good detective novelall I want is a book with a bunch of action scenes . If you think this is fast paced good for you . But if you desire more action more events more UNPREDICTABLENESS then go to a different book . I do n't know which one since I 've never read one like thatanyways do n't get this book . ",0
"I listened to the audio book that I received from a friend and I really enjoyed it . There were times that it was a bit drawn out and certain things just seemed unnecessary and unimportant but over all I did enjoy it and will continue to read the series . I just wish the ebooks were cheaper I know I can find this book online for less then five dollars used . ",3
"The book keeps you interested from start to finish ! Very exciting with twists and turns . Must add to your list . ",4
"My very first james Patterson book and it want be my last going to read all the Alex CROSS books ",4
"After several recommendations I picked up this book . More than one of the reviews on here mentions 'Smartly written ' and 'Supurb ' I question where their bar of judgement is . 3 prime examples there are many more are1 This serial killer did his first job at 12 . Later in the book it refers back to this from the killer 's perspectivePOV and he is looking back on it SIXTY years ago . Simple math apparently not done by the editors writer or any praiseworthy readers puts our serial killer at 72 years old . And this 72 year old man bests kids at video games and kills an FBI agent with a knife in hand combat ? Get real.2 Yeah we get it Alex Cross is black . Does it really need to be mentioned on every single page ? Was race the major motivator in this story ? Seems like it was more of a focus than plot . Does it really matter what race he is ? 3 No matter how good Alex Cross might be at his job a detective mouthing off to the police chief and the Mayor keeps his job and is allowed to say things like F__ you to his superiors ? Unrealistic ! New York Times Bestseller about as realistic as the Academy Awards has become . ",0
"This book is hard to put down . Another great Alex Cross adventure . His whole family is so interesting . Plot keeps you guessing . ",4
"This was simply the best mysterythriller book I 've ever read . Constantly kept me guessing surprises around every corner and superb characterization ! Alex Cross was especially moving and Gary Sonejiwellthough not my favorite bad guy he certainly is the most clever I 've ever seen.I liked the shifting viewpoint you know first person Alex Cross in one chapter then third person somebody else in the next and back and forth and so on . Also the very short length of the chapters was especially usefulI hate chapters that go on and on and on so you ca n't finish them in one night.I am verymuch looking forward to Kiss the Girls I hope to finish reading all the Cross novels before the next one FOUR BLIND MICE comes out in November.And as for the movie do n't blame them ! This novel was HUGE with LOTS of events and plot and scenes so it 's no wonder that they had to cut so much of it in order to cram it all into a 2 hour movie ! Blame the production company ! Paramount I think . In that case there might have been at least a LITTLE justice . The movie did fairly well considering how much of the plot it was able to get from the bookokay maybe not a lot but enough to make it 's own story ! ! Oh and my only problem with both book and movie I do n't get why it was called Along Came A Spider . I mean I know where that phrase came from but how does it fit into the novel ? It 's never explained . Oh well maybe I 'm just a crackhead . ",4
"Not as exciting as some of his books . I did n't care for the ending . Maybe because I have read other books with this murder that were more suspenseful . ",2
"Too violent . ",2
"This book was everything I expected from James Patterson . I ca n't wait to read the next one in this series . ",4
"This was a wonderful read . The book centers around a psychopath who gets his kicks by murdering people . Some are planned murders and some others are on the spare of the moment . His most recent victims were children of the rich and famous who reside in the Washington D.C. Maryland areas.But have no fear homicide detective and psychologist Alex Cross Ph.D. is to the rescue . He stays on the psychopath 's trail until he is beaten to a pulp . Additionally I loved the way Dr. Cross does not let the young and beautiful Jezzie Flanagan trick him into believing that she had fallen in love with him . Now that does not mean that he did n't enjoy slipping between the sheets with her little creamy white body for carnal satisfaction . But that was all it was . In the end Dr. Cross took care of business in a way that would make you proud . Read it for yourself and see if you agree . ",3
"This is the first installment in James Patterson 's Alex Cross series and it left me wanting more . This author has the capability of combining psychological suspense with the horror of the unspeakable acts that some people are capable of committing . In order to find this killer Alex Cross must try and think like the killer does thus taking you on a journey through the warped mind of a psychopath . This was the first James Patterson I have read but I will definitely keep reading this series . ",3
"Starting the first Alex Cross novel was one of the best books i have ever read . The first 200 or so pages really keep you hooked and then the last 300 make you not even want to get up . There are twists and turns everywhere especially towards the end with a Silence of The Lambs type of ending . In one review someone said the romance with Alex Cross did n't really contribute to anything and i will agree because there really was no use for the relationship considering the only real relationship they had was sex and mind games towards the end . But this book has the greatest twists and turns in almost any novel i have ever read that you can esily over look the dumb romance . I want to tell everyone the mega twist but i urge you to find out for yourselves . I will go ahead and say it concerns an unthinkable betrayel and you find out at the end of chapter 75 . Thats all im saying . What also will keep you enthralled is the characters because they are so real and interesting to read about . But despite the useless romance this book is about the best suspense thriller your gon na get I urge you to pick this one up . Now I ca n't wait to start Kiss The Girls . ",4
"Once you get started reading you can not stop lots of different turns and twist well worth reading a must read ",4
"James Patterson has created one of the most frightening characters in recent memory . What makes Gary Soneji so scary ? Well I think it is because Patterson has made him so believable . Gary Soneji is someone who could be living next to you right now.This book is fast paced and scary . It is a great read especially if you have seen the film . They are very different ! ",4
"This book is one of a series it appears . A highly competent investigator has to track down a killer of the serial variety who is most definitely crazy.There is also a female FBI agent involved and it appears that she is most likely more than a little bit dodgy as well . A dick deaths and a dodgy dame . ",2
"All in all I liked the fastmoving plot interesting characters and the mystery of trying to find out just who the bad guys were . There is a problem with the book however because the author decided to do too much too quickly.That whole business with the trial and the unusual defense could have been made into a seperate book easily but combining a trial with a kidnapping made for two weakenned storylines instead of one strong one.Also I did n't care for Gary at all . I guess I just do n't 'get ' those kind of villians . I preferred Jezzie . ",2
"This was a great book . This was my first time reading an Alex Cross book and I am thrilled to read the rest . The book was filled with all kinds of mysteries twists and turns . I look forward to reading the rest of the Alex Cross series and if you love mysterythrillerdetective novels then this is the book for you ",4
"Alex Cross is an amazing character . I began reading James Patterson after seeing the film Alex Cross . This book kept me hooked and made time go by during long twelve hour shifts . It 's a great psychological thriller and I recommend it for anyone interested in that genre . ",4
"This was a gifted item for a friend . She was bored and needed something during her time away on deployments . ",4
"I really enjoyed this book which was the first book by James Patterson that featured Alex Cross . Although not as fun to read in my opinion as Kiss The Girls I still found this book very hard to put down . There were numerous enjoyable plot twists and for a lot of the book I was guessing what was really going on . Also the ending was very exciting and I did not see it coming at all . Fans of the suspensethriller books and fans of James Patterson should not be disappointed with the book ! ",3
"This book was amazing . One of the best books that I have read in a long time . I was interested in a book that would keep my attention and this one definitely delievered . At the end of each chapter you could n't wait to continue the book . LOVED IT ! ",4
"I am not much on novels but this one is very good . I read this while on vacation and thoroughly enjoyed it . ",4
"I 've seen the movie several times . Good movie but this is my first time reading the book . WOW what a difference ! Great book a lot more story wonderful character development lots of twists and turns . Only problem was I kept 'hearing ' Morgan Freeman 's voice when Alex Cross spoke . Kinda hard to picture him in his early 30 's . He 's one of my favorite actors but I just ca n't remember him ever being young LOL . ",4
"Once again ! James Patterson writes a great read ! This is his first in the Alex Cross series . I read all the newer ones before I found these early nursery rhyme books . As always Patterson delivered ! ",4
"The first book in the Alex Cross series by James Patteron is a hit ! This book introduces Alex Cross and as you get deeper into the series you will not want to put them down . James Patterson is an awesome writer . A must read ! ",4
"I have become a fan of Alex Cross . I enjoyed the way the mystery was solved . I would recommend this book to any mystery lover . ",4
"I have not had a chance to read it yet but I will very soon . Waiting for the nesxt book to come out . ",4
"My first Alex Cross novel and certainly not my last . Very good book . ",4
"Read Alex Cross in order and you will be a happy reader . Enyoyed it very much ",4
"Patterson wins once again . His presentation of Alex Cross takes on New lives . What appears as New loves across the race differences excitement prevails . ",4
"I 'm one of those people who first saw the movie and then read the novel . I must say I absolutely loved the movie and wished the book would be just as good . The problem is that the events in this book span for so LONG events take place in a period of almost two years . There actually are pretty good suspense scenes but they are buried among pages and pages of Cross 's reflections . I 'm not saying this is bad actually Alex Cross is one of the better constructed fiction characters I have ever come across but it really slows down the action.I do agree entirely with one of the reviewers who wrote that the love scenes were tedious and one too many.Maybe it 's because the book is so different from the movie actually the movie just takes the beginning of the novel and then goes on it 's own way until the end or because I rather enjoy Jeffery Deaver 's extremely fast paced Lincoln Rhyme novels but this book did n't do it for me . This is my second PattersonCross novel . The first one was Pop Goes the Weasel which I did n't found that good either . I 'd like to give the author another shot by reading Roses are Red or Cat and Mouse which seem to be the best books in the series but I just hope they are more of the roller coaster ride other reviewer 's talk about . ",2
"I 'd heard that Patterson was a bad writer but I was n't prepared for the true impact of his shoddy gradeschool prose . The story is plodding kept alive only by singleword paragraphs and twopage chapters . The linebyline writing is juvenile and the story developments such as a splitpersonality killer being hypnotised in court feels more like a parody of a psychological thriller than a NYT best seller . Avoid . ",0
"This was the second book i had read of JP 's . I 'm glad it was because now i am addicted ! this book was fantastic thrilling right to the very end i could n't put it down . I read this book in a little over a week prior to this i would usually read novels over a period of about 2 to 3 months . JP has changed my whole overlook on reading novels and the Alex Cross series is a fantastic chain to begin with top rating for Along Came a Spider . ",4
"I know James Patterson has sold millions of booksbut I did n't care for his style.I 'm in no way a geniusbut it 's almost like he dumbs down his books for the masses.I 've tried two bookssame opinion on both . ",1
"I really enjoyed this book by James Patterson . This is the fourth book I 've read by Patterson but the first in the Alec Cross series . Very imaginative story telling.Must read for those who enjoy mystery stories . ",4
"First I 'm reviewing the whole series just right here at the start no point in going book by book.Each book has a fast pace and well developed characters . What I like most about this series are the bad guys actually . These guys are bad yes but not stupidcommon . Soneji at the start and Kyle later are the main high points . What I like least about this series is Cross . Way too goodygoody and perfect . ",3
"This book is completely uninspired . Huge swaths of pages are almost unreadable . This is fiction at its worst pressing every button to garner the highest thrill quota . Patterson does do a little better with his following novels ` Kiss the Girls ' and 'Jack and Jill ' and this is his first novel I presume from over ten years ago but it pales in comparison to some other better works . Try Jim Thomson Edward Bunker or ` Silence of the Lambs ' Which Patterson sadly rips off left and right here.This book leaves a disgusting film over the reader 's cerebral cortex . Its only saving grace is an interesting twisting plot line that really packs a well thought out wallop.Read the two in the series that I recommended and stay away from the rest of Patterson 's toxic waste land . ",1
"James Patterson books are all great and thrilling especially in the Alex Cross series ! You will want to keep reading with out a doubt ! If you buy you will with out a doubt not be disappointed ! Great book to the beginning of this series . ",4
"This was the first time I had ever read a James Patterson book and I loved it ! I ca n't wait to read more from him . ",4
"NEVER NEVER a disapointment This book is no exceptionI always think he ca n't outdo the last one but he always doesCa n't go wrong with this thriller ",4
"If you 've seen the movie do not let that stop you from reading the book . It is a great suspense novel and quite different from the moviemuch more character development and more to the story . ",3
"I ca n't understand how many people hate this book ! I find it extremely entertaining suspenseful exciting and I 'm not illiterate nor am I a 12 yearold . I think some people take these books way too seriously ! Was I wrong in thinking that books were all about losing yourself in the story ? I 'll admit some things in the story annoyed me but that happens with every book . I have enough of reality everyday I like a little unrealistic getaway every now and again . If you want to be entertained and just forget about reality for a while I definitely recommend James Patterson . ",3
"This was my first Patterson book and it certainly wo n't be my last . The book was well written enjoyable and I loved the characters . To me the makings of a good book are looking forward to the next page and the one after that what 's going to happen next is not apparent and I want to read more by the author . All these were true for me with this book . I 'm white but I thought it was great to have the heros and main characters black for a change . My husband and I have very different tastes in books but there are some we both enjoy and this was one . ",4
"I truly believe that Patterson believes threefourths of the world if not more is illiterate . This book irritated the hell out of me . For goodness sakes I am a sentient intelligent person who can structure a sentence and appreciate a good phrase.What is this regurgitated madness ? Yada yada yada.Stop pandering for the sake of a buck . One word to the reader NEXT ! ! ! Smooches ! ",0
"James Patterson is a great author . I am hooked on Alex Cross and buy them when they come out . A great read . ",4
"The title seems to have no connection but the story is good . The end just seems to happen fast and good bye . Not like the several others I 've read . I 'll try another though . ",2
"This book kept me on the edge of my chair from the first chapter . Alex Cross is such a believable character and the paths he takes through this book are so exciting ! The ending was not a complete surprise because I could kinda see it coming but Patterson 's book definitely surprised me in other ways ! I 'm definitely going to look for other books by Patterson and especially Alex Cross ! ",3
"The villains are notorious and the plot twists are legendary in the first Alex Cross novels . This remains Patterson 's best work and the closest he ever came to topping this was 'Kiss the Girls'.Nasty serial killer Gary Soneji even the name sounds scary kidnaps two kids from a school in Washington DC . But they 're not just any kids . They belong to those of a US senator and actor and then the manhunt for Gary Soneji begins.This was Patterson at his peak . His characyers were well developed unlike his earlier novels and Alex Cross especially . In this one he 's portrayed as a black detective who struggles to raise his kids in the ghettos of Washington . In his later ones he 's just desperate and dateless not unlike Ally Mcbeal.I was rather dissapointed with the movie adaption but hey that 's Hollywood . ",4
"Having missed this one in the Cross series I have planned to read it for a time . As usual it was a great book . I really enjoyed the short chapters and constant thinking of the Mad Man and what runs through their minds . The research was as always first class . The plot runs and twists always please . I guess to put it plainly it could not have been a better read . Fast smooth and elegant . ",4
"This book was a fun read . I enjoyed the story and there was a really strange twist . I have to say that I was scared several timesI mean really scared . I do not recommend reading this book at nightor in the darkor alone . ",3
"I am hooked on James Patterson 's books . There are lots of twists and turns and a bit of a surprise ending . ",4
"I choose this book for the title and I had never read J. Patterson before . The author described the main dective 's inner thougts emotions and his family conection in every chapter . He is always looking for the answer the to kidnaping and not quite reaching it twists and turn keeping you wanting more . ",4
"This book has been around since the mid 90s but I just got around to reading it . As you might expect it was a lot more detailed and better than the movie . The one problem I had was Morgan Freeman stuck in my head as the protagonist due to the movie . If you have n't already read the book read it then watch the movie again just to compare . I found it entertaining to do so . ",3
"I love the Alex Cross series . I always wonder though why Patterson has to have a new chapter after only three or four pages . The storyline is n't changing that much . Waste of paper and ink . ",4
"Patterson keeps the suspense going right up to the end . Every time I think I have things figured out they take another turn . On to the next book asap . ",4
"I really enjoyed this book . It was fast pase and kept me guessing . I enjoy reading Jame Patterson becuase his chapters are short and to the point . I also like dialogue and not long descriptive chapters . ",3
"I was n't sure what to expect as James Patterson writes so much and I questioned his ability in this particular genre . However I found that he did a great job with this one and it was an amazing way to introduce the central character Alex Cross as well as the position he found himself in both life and career . Good read . ",4
"This book did n't disappoint me it was another good read in this Alex Cross series . I love the personal style and yet action and mystery James Patterson weaves in these stories . ",4
"The reason why virtually all of this man 's novels are on the New York Time 's bestseller list is because they are all politically correct to the extreme brilliant black psychologists and heroines racist police and villains heroic Black figures assasinated by racists.You can only go so far before you start to delude reality and make the book unbelievable and James Patterson certainly does that particularly in this book .

"I picked up Along Came A Spider as something to read on the plane . I ended up getting delayed which was annoying but in the end not a bad thing as it gave me time to spend with this book . Once I started reading I ended up using all my free time to finish it which I did the following day.The protagonist of the novel is psychologistdetective Alex Cross a black man living in the South East an area near Washington D.C. Cross and his partner are among the elite in the police force . Described as the Last Southern Gentleman Cross is a great and unique character who likes to dote on his kids and play the piano in the middle of the night on his porch.Cross and his partner get called into investigate the kidnapping of two children of influential figures in Washington . We know from the start who committed the kidnapping and we even get to explore their motivations through the third person point of view . However this does n't ruin the story . The kidnapper Gary SonejiMurphy has planned everything to the last detail as he tries to pull off the crime of the century . Cross has a challenge on his hands.Just when you think you get everything figured out in this story you come across an unexpected twist . This may be a bit of a spoiler but they do catch Soneji much earlier than you would expect . Just when you would expect that to be the end of the book the real scheme and plot kicks in . This portion of the novel reminded me a bit of Hannibal Lechter from Silence of the Lambs and Aaron Stampler from Diehl 's Primal Fear . However Patterson has added some twists that those novels did n't explore . I hesitate to elaborate so as not to ruin the surprise . In the last fourth of the novel you 'll find yourself racing through the pages just to find that just when you had it figured out your expectations get dashed as the story takes another unexpected turn . I know it sounds cliche but I felt that Patterson pulled this off well.This novel does have a bit of a social commentary to it . Cross rebels at being pulled off a murder case in the beginning of the novel to be put on the kidnapping case of two white rich children . The victims in his murder case were poverty stricken blacks . Patterson also explores a relationship between Cross and Jezzie a white Director in the Secret Service which leads to a confrontation with some ignorant drunk men and a cross burning . These sub plots do tie into the story fairly well though.This is the first of the Alex Cross series of novels that I have read . It is also the first novel by James Patterson that I have read . It wo n't be the last as I am eager to move onto its sequels . I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in suspense crime or psychological thriller novels . ",4
"This book flies . I had just read a couple of books that I thought were pretty lame and needed something fast and exciting . A woman I work with recommended James Patterson to me . I did a little research and found that this book is the first in a series for fictional detective Alex Cross . I hate to read a series out of order even if the stories are independent and do n't continue from book to book . Along Came A Spider is a perfect fun read . It moves at a very rapid pace . The chapters are usually just a few pages . It has pretty well developed characters considering its quick pace and more plot twists than you 'll ever anticipate . Just when the romance element in the book started to bore me Patterson turns it on its ear . Another thing that makes this book so good is that despite the surprising plot twists everything is fairly believable within the context of the story . I read a lot of mysterysuspense and one of my biggest complaints is that I 'll get really into a book and the climax will be totally ridiculous . You know the killer will turn out to be the sister of the girl that was accidentally drown in the rich family 's pool the night of the prom thirtyfive years before but nobody recognizes her because she 's a master of disguise or whatever ! Along Came A Spider has none of that . It 's consistent quick and exciting ! Read it ! ",3
"This was the first book I 've read by James Patterson . I thought it had a lot of surprises which I love . It was very hard to put down . ",4
"I had already seen the movie on TV but the book took a slightly different twist on the story line . There was a surprise in every chapter . Was hard to put the book down . ",4
"I enjoy reading James Patterson and this was not a disappointment . I would recommend this book to any James Patterson fan . ",4
"First and foremost let me quote reviewer dan x I did a little research and found that this book is the first in a series for fictional detective Alex Cross . I hate to read a series out of order even if the stories are independent and do n't continue from book to book.I also did some research and came up with the same results as he did and I too hate reading books out of sequence . It is indeed a very fast and engrossing read that has pretty much of everything in it . I will doubtlessly look forward to reading future Alex Cross novels there 's no doubt about that . If they are anywhere near as good as Along Came a Spider was then they 're excellent . ",4
"Alex Cross a streetsmart psychologist who happens to moonlight as a detective crosses paths with the brilliant and deadly Son of Lindbergh a multiple kidnapper who targets Alex 's children as his next prey . A real pageturner with plenty of plot twists and surprises . ",3
"This book was a subject that distresses me but I could not put the book down I had to read it . Very compelling ! ",4
"Alex Cross debuts in James Patterson 's book with clumsy entrances . Alex a strong black intelligent and handsome black psychologist and detective is sucked into a case involving two kidnapped children . One the son of the Treasury secretary guarded by two secret service agents is killed shortly after the kidnapping and the other goes missing . They quickly find the kidnapper and killer but fail to find the little girl . This story would have been good had Patterson chosen not to interrupt the scenes with boring and useless romance scenes . These scenes which would have prevented most thriller readers from consummating the book are bulky and do nothing but add pages . ",2
"The audio book was very good . I was able to listen to it going to and from work each day . I have not seen the movie so I do not know which version is better . ",3
"If you love James Patterson you will love this book . The story is well constructed the characters sparkle . Alex Cross has lost his partner and is back in action with the assistance of a new side kick . But can he trust her ? The action is fast paced and the suspense stays with you until the last page . Who is the bad guy ? Will Alex lose this partner in his attempt to locate the Senators lost daughter ? Who will die and who will survive ? Alex Cross is in a race with time and he does battle with the unique mind of a serial killer as well as a set of bad guys that comes as a surprise in the end . Be ready to begin reading and not stop until you have reached the end . I highly recommend this book . ",4
"This is the novel that launched one of the most read and beloved detective series of all time . The protagonist Alex Cross has the authority expected by crime readers and enough humanity to keep casual readers interested . Patterson 's short chapters and clean prose allowed this to be a great fast paced read . ",3
"Great plot believable characters and not overly wordy.I read this novel and watched the movie and hated the movie so if you saw the movie first just remember the movie is terrible compared to the book . The movie had a large number of unbelievable concepts which thankfully the book did not include . The only annoyance was the 80+ chapters with 3 or 4 page chapters . All in all the book was fun but they did n't need to waste so much paper with the big bold words Chapter # . hehPOSSIBLE SPOILERLast comment on the book is that Patterson gives away a little too much information in the part where Jezzie is in North Carolina with another man besides Alex . It spoiled everything so I 'll drop it a star just for that . ",3
"Edition Reviewed Warner Books Paperback February 2001 520 pages including the brief excerpt from _1st to Die_ at the end of the bookMy personal enjoyment rating 8 out of 10My recommendation rating 7 out of 10 . Explanation of recommendation rating Genre fans should enjoy it as well as a lot of people with a more passing interest in the genre . Flaws are starting to show . Serious literature fans someone who reads a few books per month but does n't have special feelings for the genre should give these more consideration before spending their time or money . Casual nongenre readers who read one book per month or less should generally stay away from 7 's or anything lower.The good news is that James Patterson 's _Along Came A Spider_ is fairly unpredictable and quite a pageturner . It is also very interesting structurally . The bad news is that at least in this book Patterson 's writing style occasionally comes across as mildly hacklike . However some of the hacklike mannerisms are peculiar enough that they almost become endearing by the end of the book and if indicative of Patterson 's writing style overall could turn out to be an attractor for longterm fans rather than a set of annoying quirks that would turn a reader away from his work._Along Came A Spider_ is Patterson 's introduction to what has turned out to be a continuing character in a series of suspensemystery books DetectiveDoctor Alex Cross to date the character continues in the novels _Kiss the Girls_ 1994 _Jack & Jill_ 1996 _Cat & Mouse_ 1997 _Pop Goes the Weasel_ 1999 _Roses are Red_ 2000 _Violets are Blue 2001 and _Four Blind Mice_ 2002 . In _Along Came a Spider_ we begin with Cross investigating the latest crime executed by a serial killer who is striking targets in the ghettos of Washington D.C. Cross who still lives in the ghettos himself despite the fact that he 's a bigwig on the D.C. police force and has a Ph.D. in psychology is suddenly called away with his partner John Sampson to investigate the kidnapping of two rich and famous kids by one of their teachers and it all happened right under the nose of Secret Service agents . Patterson weaves all of these threads and more together as we delve into the mind of the kidnapper discover whether maybe there 's some connection to the ghetto serial murders and discover whether there is more than one villain.Structurally _Along Came a Spider_ is very interesting in that for quite a few chapters in the beginning of the book Patterson alternates one chapter of firstperson writing as Cross with one chapter of the more traditional thirdperson omniscient which at first is primarily concerned with the villain Gary Soneji . On the negative side for some readers this technique might be distracting as it breaks up the flow more than a mere change of setting does and at first Patterson seems to have laid out a plan saying All of the even numbered chapters will be firstperson all of the odd numbered chapters will be thirdperson . However as the book progresses one gets used to the flipflopping perspectives and Patterson eventually finds a more natural flow to the changes letting a number of chapters at a time continue from the same perspective as fits the story.For a firsttime reader of Patterson at leastand that includes methe first few chapters might also prove to be relatively rough going because of Patterson 's hacklike quirks . One place this is easily evidenced is in his titles . We could even come up with probable future names of Patterson books on our own . _Kick the Can_ _Follow the Leader_ _Hickory Dickory Dock_ and _Pocketful of Rye_ are likely titles if they 're not already taken . Patterson puts many slangy and clich & eacuted phrases in his writing like Cool beans Cold as a meat locker A lot of sound and fury signifying _nada_ etc . and they often come across as if he 's thinking I need to put some slangy hip street lingo in the story here . His descriptions meant to provide character depth often seem calculated and choppy and he gives characters odd quirks like playing Public Enemy songs on a piano which seems like maybe Patterson just quickly did an Internet search for urban bands that were supposed to be hip at the time . He also has a middleaged black man wear say a Hoodoo Gurus baseball cap with no character background that would give it a believable context . It ends up reading like maybe Patterson likes or knows someone who likes the Hoodoo Gurus and decided to stick the name in the book . These kinds of quirks occur very oftena few times per chapter on average . We might also count as a flaw that there are too many characters and some such as Sampson seem like they should either have been fleshed out more and made more important or dropped altogether.On the other hand when we get down to the bare bones of the narrative Patterson certainly knows how to compose and more importantly propel a good suspensemystery novel . The overall flow of the writing works well enough and the basic plot is well constructed enough that you keep reading despite the flaws and you soon get hooked on the story as well as the characters . The hacklike quirks almost start to become charming in a goofy way . And even though Patterson occasionally slows things down with a chapter or two his chapters tend to be very short so it 's not long until you get back to action exciting plot developments and revelations including a few nice twists.The most telling comment however is that I just finished _Along Came a Spider_ this morning after reading it fairly quickly and this afternoon I 'm going to stop by the bookstore to pick up _Kiss the Girls_ . That overrides any negative criticism about _Along Came a Spider_ being a less than perfect book and should be compliment enough . ",2
"Great book . Could not put it down . Love all James Patterson 's book . Ca n't wait to read the next book . Excited ",4
"I thoroughly enjoyed this book especially the Alex Cross character who is played by Morgan Freeman in the movies . ",4
"So mad at this book . It was pretty good for the first 34 . Then it completely goes off the rails . First is some annoying distracting moralizing about interracial dating . It 's totally out of place in a psychological thriller . Did the author need to fill pages for his book contract ? Then the farce of a trial . Somehow the allegedly splitpersonality killer gets hypnotized during the trial . Yes hypnotized . During the trial . You could not make this schlock up . Well I guess you could . If you were an overrated hack . There 's 8 hours of my life I will never get back . ",0
"Held your interest . Well written . I would read another James Patterson book such as Along Came a Spider . Excellent book ",4
"First I went to see the movie and maybe that 's why I found this book has a lack of concise story . First I want to give this book 3 stars but since I start to read his second Alex Cross novel 'Kiss the girls ' I found that James Patteson is one of the greatest mystery novelist . The plot is good and reasonable it has unexpected twists but in the middle of the book after kidnaping it seemed as Patterson did n't know how to continue the idea he has started with . So there is like 100 an plus pages you can easily skip but the ending is unexpected and really surprising . It 's just somehow irritating as suspense novel is everything but taut in the place where you want to let your dog starve for a day and your finacee is waiting for a ball game just for you but you are in your own universe . The serial kidnaper is an intelegent person and so the hero needs to be so this is a good premise which run well in the novel . As it 's his first novel you can see that character of Alex Cross is n't buildup very well yet so sometimes the hero reacts or behave in outoflogic manner and in some parts of the book he 's not so belivable . Story is well buid there is enough of suspense and unusual twists . Still worth of your time and money just to introduce yourself to the 1st part of great mystery travel to Crossland . ",3
"Very good book . It really kept me guessing . It had a lot of twists and turns . I would recommend it . ",3

She too is a highly qualified cast member of the story and those in the know recognise her for what she is . A player.And so to the writing . It is beautifully balanced with excellent building of suspense and tension as you progress through the story . The characters are fantastically created and each have their own set of histories . The book itself has longer and deeper chapters than the newer releases from the world famous writer and the book feels more solid as a result . The language is strong another difference from the newer books but given the setting of the characters and their histories I guess the reader can overlook this . The book is violent . It certainly is not funny . That would be totally ridiculous . There are moments of poignancy and emotion scattered like grains of chalk across an empty blackboard . It has an excellent feel and will make the reader deeply deeply satisfied at the end.And so to the ending . It is quite extraordinary . It is multidirectional with twists and turns . And chops and changes . You wont know where to look except for at the white of your kindle screen or the psperback you sre holding . And the final chapter is exquisitely thrilling exciting and nail biting . A final moment of poignancy finishes this classic thriller of the 1990s and you will find yourself a little sad at book 's end . Another true sign of greatness . At least there are 20 more books to read.I think i have said enough . This is one of the modern day classics of the genre and i consider myself privileged to have come across it so long after it was released . The world owes it thanks to James Patterson for giving us such a fantastic tale and yet another superhero to stand up against the evils that exist in our world.BFN Greggorio ! ",3

"This is the first series of the Alex Cross novels created by James Patterson . I have read all of them three or four times each by now..they really are that addictive . Alex Cross the fictional loveofmylife is a tough detectivepsychologist in the Southeast side of Washington D.C. Alex has a wonderful family and best friend Sampson who I always imagine as a Forrest Whittaker type who help him get through his daily doses of crime and maiming .

Their favorite math teacher Gary Soneji takes them burries them in the ground and demands a huge ransom . These two students were children of the most prominent families in the area . Alex and Sampson are taken off a brutal crime in the D.C. area and forced onto the GoldbergDunne kidnappings . Everyone gets involved . Secret Service FBI and the Washington police all try to work together to solve the crime . This book has so many twist and turns and plots within plots it will make your head spin . Every page you turn reveals something new and exciting . Even when Gary Soneji is caught.nobody is sure who is responsibleGary seems to have a split personality Remember Adam Stampler from Primal Fear and the outcome of his trial is questionable . You have to read this bookAlex Cross books like this one and Kiss the Girls are movies now but they never let you see Alex in an intimate way . he has a loveable family his best pal Sampson and lots of juicy romances . All of these are left out of the movies . Why ? because Patterson wants you to see the movielove itand then read the books..because he KNOWS you too will like it better than the movies and read the whole series . I promise the books are really are not comparable to the movies . ",4

"If you can read them from the first book . The stories are intertwined and you get more by reading the series in order . ",4
"Another great book by James Patterson . The story and characters were complex and the situation plausible.How well do we know the people in our lives particularly the ones who are involved with our children is the crux of the story and that is thought provoking as it should be.Highly recommended . 5 stars . ",4
"I must say this novel was a very entertaining novel or at least most of it . The part that was actually mystery and suspense is no doubt five stars . But why I chose to give this book four stars is because of the boring romantic part of it . I do hope Kiss the Girls is more entertaining novel than this one is . I do n't want to be the only James Patterson fan that just thinks the series is only good I want it to be great . ",3
"Kept me guessing with numerous twists and turns . First rate suspense with good character development . Look forward to another Alex cross story . ",2
"I thought I 'd give this a go due to the immense popularity James Patterson has garnered . I enjoyed this run of the mill detective novel but not as much as I enjoy Harlan Coben & Michael Connelly 's detective novels . The hero Alex Cross is a detective who has psychology qualifications.Moderately recommended . ",3
"ALONG CAME A SPIDER by James Patterson.The plot the events and actions were very well done . I was surprised and pleased . The book definitely kept my interest . The main reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because I did n't smile . I think of Grisham who takes me to the 5 star level . He writes a similar genre but he makes me smile either at the intriguing characters or the wow that is so exciting when being chased or trapped or wondering if the hero will survive.At times I felt impatient to get some answers . The result was it felt a little slow . I 've read other police procedural mysteries that had me less impatient and enjoying the journey more.The narrator Charles Turner was fine but I wish Morgan Freeman had narrated . The character Alex Cross is a black man from the south . Morgan played Alex in the movie and I kept thinking about him . He would have been a great narrator.The story is told in first person from Alex 's point of view and then third person for other characters and events . That structure worked ok but I would have preferred third person for all . When he switches to first person I am almost taken out of the story thinking of myself my perspective.DATAUnabridged audiobook reading time 12 hrs and 21 mins . Violence strong . The killer likes cutting off body parts . Swearing language strong . Sexual language none . Sex scenes about 8 referred to no details shown . The couple is a black man and a white woman . Setting the early 1990s mostly east coast U.S. locations . Book copyright 1992 . Genre mystery suspense police procedural . Ending the good guys win but there are many victims of violence . ",3
"I am working my way through the Alex Cross series and am truly enjoying each book . I will be reading more of Patterson 's books when I finish this series . ",3
"Loved this book..I love a psychological thriller.makes you think about what CAN happen in real lifethis is first Alex Cross book I have read and ca n't wait to read the next one ",4
"Lots of ups and downs in this book . Keeps you guessing . Really had me feeling for the people in the story . ",3
"Along Came A Spider is an extremely interesting story with a twisted plot and plenty of suspense . It is almost like two stories in one & # 8212the evil of the psychopathic perpetrator and the events experienced by Alex Cross as he becomes immersed in his investigation . The plot is definitely interesting and kept my attention from beginning to end . It is a wonderful mystery a mind boggling psychological thriller and contains enough action and events to make one wonder when it all will end . James Patterson still spins a tale that will entice me to read other books written by him.Jeanette Cooper Author ofWhen Justice is Served ",3
"Good read . I could not stop until the book was finished . Many twists and turns . Five stars all the way . ",4
"To me Gary Soneji is FAR and AWAY a better crafted character than Hannibal Lecter is . Almost jumping off the pages and into your nightmares is what James Patterson manages to succeed in doing to you . Here is fair warning IF you have a penchant for dreaming about the books you read you may want to avoid Patterson 's books at all costs ! His characters are SO BAD they almost defy the words in the English language to fully describe . Gary Soneji is also one thing many serial killers are not He is VERY smart maybe not smart enough NOT to kill but pretty darned intelligent but he is also hopelessly past all ability to rehabilitate too . Patterson 's pace is so fast that there is practically a new chapter on everyotherpage . The pacing is like a semi coming down a steep grade with no brakes . Watch OUT ! If you are into SMART storytelling Gary Soneji is n't the ONLY smart one in this book than Patterson 's Alex Cross novels are the bar by which everyone else is judged . ",3
"This was the third Alex Cross book I have read and so far it was the best . In this exciting story Patterson creates a suspenseful plot with some extra twists.The main plot is detective Alex Cross searching for a murdererkidnapper . But Alex Cross has a number of social and political issues that he deals with on a daily basis an example is being pulled off of the murder case of a black family in the projects to find the kidnapper of some rich white kids.Cross ' witty replies are always entertaining when he is confronted by one of his superiors . I also like the way that the subplots in this story came together it was n't just filler material . This book left me wanting for more . ",4
"Alex Cross is such a likable character exciting in his official capacity touching as a father.Along Came a Spider keeps you on the edge right up til the end a MUST READ for suspense lovers . what a gripping story ! ! ",4
"A great book . The storyline was great but lacked in description of the scenes . I could n't imagine myself in the scenes very often . It was a great suspenseful book though . ",3
"Absolutley stellar writing on Patterson 's part found myself having a hard time putting it down and finished in a couple of weeks now I am not much of a reader due to my visual impairment but loved the bookreally keeps you going and wondering what happened to the kidnapped girl Maggie Rose Dunne will say that I suspected one of the supporting roles to be in on the caper from the begining Highly reccomend this to anyone from avid reader to modestbeginner readers.keeps you on your toes and grabs you by the short and curlies from the first page . First Rate all the way ",4
"This is the second time I have read this book . It had been a number of years since I had read this for the first time . This time and also first time when I started reading this mystery I found it was intriguing enough to make me want to read more . I thought it was cleverly written in how the abduction of a child took place and then the cat and mouse game of catching the teacher who kidnapped her.How Alex Cross came to be drawn into working the crime after he had stopped working any cases because of an unfortunate incident when he was in charge of another case.This was number one of a series of books about Alex Cross and I have enjoyed every one of them . Some more so than others but I still enjoy reading them . ",4
"James Paterson writes in a way that it is fast past conise and to the point . I feel when you read his books there is no guess work just let the story flow . When you get to the end you like Wow ! ! I just could n't believe it . All his books are very entertaining . This first book of the Alex Cross series introduce you a detective name Alex Cross who is not just a detective but an African American detective . I feel he is a hero for all people . The way James Patterson decribes Alex and his family gives you a different viewpoint than your average run of the mill detective story . This book is an excellent read as always read the book first before watching the movie . ",4
"I enjoyed this book the first of Patterson 's Alex Cross stories . The book was very exciting and well written about a psychopath who kidnaps and kills people . The story begins with the character who is the crazy guy Gary SonejiMurphy who has multiple severe personality disorders along with being a complete nutcase due to his terrible childhood . Gary SonejiMurphy plays a school teacher at a dayschool for rich kids when his intent is really to kidnap and kill the DunneGoldberg children . And finally one day he lured the children into his van and kidnaps them drugging one and eventually killing the other child . This kidnapping has the whole DC area up in arms and Alex Cross works day and night to capture SonejiMurphy but he does n't do that until he kills a few more people in different places . His whole game throughout the book is that he Wants to be Somebody . He is the master of killing and he enjoys the game.Alex Cross trys to help all he can and he gets inside SonejiMurphy 's head and gets him to tell him all of his horrible little secrets after Soneji gets captured the first time and put into prison . Later though Soneji escapes from prison and causes more problems . More than just SonejiMurphy though is an accomplice . Alex fell in love with a female detective on his team not realizing that she is actually the one behind more of these problems with the kidnappings and knows the answers to what happened with the children.Cross puts the puzzle all together and the book is very fast moving and keeps you guessing what will happen next !

"Writing this review so long after the release of the book is leading me to take the approach that I 'm speaking now to those of you who are n't overly familiar with James Patterson and the Alex Cross series . First of all let me begin by saying that I 'm a big advocate of reading series ' from beginning to end without skipping books along the way . Because of that and because I can unequivically tell you that the Cross books only get better I 'm giving Along Came a Spider 3 stars and recommending that it be read.With that in mind this book was SLOW . I understand that Patterson was working to set up the lives of characters who would be carried over for later novels in the series but the overall action in this book was a drag . Heck even the timeline of the story spans more than two years ! I greatly respect James Patterson . He 's one of my favorite authors and I will be the first to tell anyone that the novels in the Alex Cross series typically make for really great reads . But I 've got to be honest with you regarding the first one The engine definitely took a while to leave the station for this series starter . ",2
"I know my opinion does not seem to be shared by the masses but I definitely do not feel that this book was one of James Patterson 's best . Even allowing for the extra description required to set up a character so that a series can be made out of him i.e . Alex Cross Patterson drags this story at best.I will admit that I read the first 250 or so pages VERY quickly but all of a sudden the novel seemed to lose steam . Combine this with the budding romance of Alex Cross that was focused on to the nth degree and did nothing to advance the plot and it made for a very difficult novel to complete.I made myself finish the novel because I was eager to get on to other Alex Cross novels that I knew received rave reviews . I too do not like to read a series out of order so I forced myself through the remaining pages . However I found myself questioning whether or not ANY of the other Alex Cross books would be worth reading they are do n't worry during the course of this book.One last bit before I conclude I was INCREDIBLY disturbed by the final chapters of this novel and I do not feel much of the description was necessary to get Patterson 's view across.With all this being said please do not use Spider as a judge for the other books in the Alex Cross series . I have not come upon these issues again in any of the other Cross novels I have completed . But suffice it to say that it took a little while for Patterson to find a rhythm for his most famous leading man . ",2
"Alex Cross is an articulate educated black man who is a homicide detective Washington D.C. police department . He just needs to be in a better novel.In this debut novel that features said character Cross is put on a case to find two white wealthy kids abducted from a private school . This bothers him somewhat as he was on a case where two black children are missing and yet no law officials seem interested.The villain of the piece is Gary Soneji who masqueraded as an instructor of the private school he is your typical psycho who is also brilliant and wants to be remembered throughout history . These types of villains showed up a lot in the films of the 1990s.Cross meets a beautiful blonde white FBI agent named Jezzie whom he has a relationship with and gets serious withonly that he finds out that she in a confusing plot turn had something to do with the two abducted white children . She was only faking a relationship with Cross to get police information from him Jezzie and two other officers also in a confusing plot turn somehow took charge of the abducting operation of the private school children.Cross in an unrealistic manner catches Jezzie by going back to an island they traveled to early in the novel having people placed strategically in places as if he had clairvoyance that Jezzie would 1 . Come back with him to the island . 2 . They would travel the exact way where his people would be waiting . 3 . Jezzie would say exactly what he needed to know in order to have evidence to arrest her and her cohorts.Interestingly Jezzie is the one who is given the death penalty and Soneji is not.only hinting from his cell that he will be back . Moreover it is said that Soneji had something to do with the missing black kids as well ! Now as aforementioned I am familiar with the film adaptation of this novel and that was n't an improvement . It was actually worse . Both the film and the novel it was based on is confusing convoluted and generic or clichednot too mention unrealistic with how certain things automatically fall into place or how the main character has as aforementioned plot clairvoyance.I do plan on reading the next entry ` Kiss the Girls ' and I hope there is an improvement .

"When I read a book and I keep reading and I get nothing of the main story I say that the writer is green dyeing the grass since I already know that the grass is green with out dyeing it I think that I do n't have to read words that does n't say anything for exampleThe JezzieAlex 's affair could be written in five lines at the beginning of the book and five more at the end so you can understand why she was a bad agent . The book has chapters and chapters of this affair.What happened with Alex 's family is part of the book but whatever they are going to have for breakfast every morning who cares ? The trial is boring and it repeats everything you already know . And as the rabbit I can keep on and on ",1
"ALONG CAME A SPIDER is another of those novels that leaves me equivocal one thumb up and one thumb down . I hate that.Dr.Detective Alex Cross a Washington DC forensic psychologistgumshoe and his partner John Sampson are assigned to investigate a double kidnapping with the FBI and Secret Service . The victims are Michael and Maggie the former the young son of the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and the latter the young daughter of a movie star . Very early on the reader knows the identity of the perp a brilliant serial killer named Gary Soneji and Michael 's fate . As Gary continues his murderous swathe across the landscape all wonder . How do we catch this guy and where 's Maggie ? The best thing about this thriller is Cross a worldweary widower who loves his kids and his grandmother and who 's not afraid to be in the honorable tradition of Eastwood 's Dirty Harry a thorn in the side of his boss and the mayor . You got ta love the guy . Also the Maggie character was endearing but author James Patterson gave her too little press time.The main problem with the book is that at 502 pages in paperback it 's about 50 too long . By the novel 's end Gary 's essential evilness and the de rigueur plot twist have been diluted out by an overabundance of other bad guys and the relationship between Cross and Secret Service agent Jezzie Flanagan which Patterson develops ad nauseam . Moreover for the apparent sake of maintaining the potential for a series a major thread is left hanging . It 's as if the author or his editor did n't know when to quit . Less would have been better.The movie version of ALONG CAME A SPIDER was recently released starring Morgan Freeman . From the trailers I 've seen the film adaptation seems to be a different story entirely . Gee what a surprise ! Besides the opportunity to observe the great actor Freeman I 'll want to see if the output of some Tinseltown scriptwriter can force both my thumbs in the same direction . Up or down I do n't care . I just want closure . ",2
"Author James Patterson again at his best . Readers who are not familiar with Patterson 's work may find his shortchapter style an unattractive read and be put off by the style . New readers to Patterson 's style need to give his books a chance knowing that the reader will find Patterson 's stories a good read.This reader is used to Patterson 's style of writing and finds that it adds to the attraction of the read . Riveting and enjoyable for this avid reader is the shifting from Alex Cross in one chapter with another character in the next back and forth . This JP fan had the pleasure of meeting Patterson more than once in Manhattan before 911.ALONG CAME A SPIDER is riveting and glues you to reading the book in as less sittings as possible . This bestseller is written simply with a harrowing plot . Detective Alex Cross family man and psychologist too profoundly plays a key role in many of Patterson 's novels . Cross ' manner and delivery of detecting is above par with a concentrated number of detectives in novels among which are Sara Paretsky 's VI Warshawski and Patricia Cornwell 's Kay Scarpetta . Considering it is the first Alex Cross book Cross is a character a reader can relate to with his mild manner but harddriving methods of investigation.Cross ' associate in the plot is Jezzie Flanagan also a police detective with a PhD in psychology connected with the Secret Service . Two crimestoppers who work symbiotically in their efforts to apprehend a chilling psychopath Gary Soneji who commits child kidnapping murder of a school teacher horrific acts and all this from a man Soneji who can easily be labelled a splitpersonality while appearing as a mildmannered popular math teacher at an elite private school for children of the affluent society and known to the students as Mr. Chips.ALONG CAME A SPIDER is engrossing & amp thrilling emitting emotions that deliver a truetolife portrayal . Victimizer Gary Soneji resembles in some ways other perpetrators who get into your mind throughout the story such as Hannibal Lector . Soneji with his terrifying crimes outsmarts the FBI Secret Service and Police Department . Detectives Cross and Flanagan face the ultimate as psychologists to outmaneuver a brilliant psychopath before his next victim and the next and the nextThis selfprofessed biblioholic always looks forward to a James Patterson read . Thank you Mr. Patterson . ",4
"Maybe it 's because I was just coming off reading Red Dragon but I found this story to remind me too much of all the serial killer hype that I see so much of all over the place.It 's not that this book was bad it just did n't really do it for me . I mainly read it because I enjoyed the movie Kiss The Girls based on the Patterson novel of the same name . I thought that story was intriguing . This one just did n't move me much . ",1
"This is my second PattersonCross book after Kiss the girls which I really liked . Both are part of a series featuring the psychologistdetective Alex Cross a tough Washington DC cop.Along came a spider is an interesting book . It 's the first one in the Cross series where the readers are introduced to the main characters that will make part in the series like Cross his partner Sampson Cross family etc.Patterson has a very peculiar style of narrative . His chapters are usually short wich makes the reading very fastpaced and thrilling . Also Patterson has two kinds of narrative one in the firstperson where we see what Alex Cross is experiencing and believing and it 's a very personal and onesided narrative the other style is in third person where the reader follows the steps of the main suspect of the crime the story is about . So to be clear we KNOW who the killermurdererkidnapperwhatever is from the very beggining . Does this spoil the plot or the reading ? No ! Patterson is master in delivering subplots twists nuances about characters along the book all very interesting and they make the pursuitmanhunt very enjoyable.In Along came a spider Gary Soneji is the kidnapper fanatic about the Lindberg case who intents to make history by taking away two very important children . Cross and his teammates in DC Police FBI and Secret Service have to stop him before he strikes again . This is just the first plot of the story and it keeps changing every ten or twenty chapters.One thing I found annoying though is that Patterson made Cross something like a superhuman being . There were times when I thought Cross was virtually invincible . But that is something minor.What really matters is that Patterson created believable characters in one really good thriller . I will surely read the other books in the series and I 'm waiting for Patterson 's incursion in medieval times The jester.Grade 8.810 ",4
"Along Came a Spider is the first installment in the detective Alex Cross series by Patterson . I did not read these books in order but that has not detracted from the flow of any of the books . Since I have read the other books first and the first book last Detective Alex Cross has changed somewhat into a mellower more likeable character . I did not see the movie but had envisioned Denzel Washington to play the smooth and sophiscated Alex Cross and was disappointed in the choice of Morgan Freeman . But after reading this book Morgan Freeman fits Alex Cross in this book perfectly for this book only ! ! ! I love Patterson 's books and have read just about all of them . I find them to be engrossing suspenseful and I just ca n't put them down . He foils me with the ending each and every time ! ! In this book Patterson has a serial killer at large Gary Soneji who has kidnapped two children and who wants to be known as somebody . Jezzie Flannagan from the FBI is also on the case giving Cross support to capture the killer . Three great strong main characters exposed to the reader so as to get into their psyche yet intertwined with each other to make for one incredible story.The ending is a blow out which is what I love about Patterson hanging on to the edge of your seat with each and every page and giving you the shocker at the end . I love it ! His books are definite thrillers and shockers ! ",4
"James Patterson is wellknown for his popular Alex Cross series and Along Came A Spider is the first installment introducing Alex Cross et . al . The story opens with a prologue regarding the infamous kidnapping and murder of the Lindbergh baby in 1932 as explained through the thoughts of the 12year old kidnapper . It then jumps to 1992 and introduces Alex Cross who is a brilliant Homicide detective and psychologist his partner John Sampson and his delightful grandmother Nana Mama . As the story unfolds Alex and his partner are called to a triple homicide scene where a mother daughter and 3year old boy have been brutally murdered a similar murder has just previously occurred and Cross suspects this is just the beginning of a rash of serial murders in the poorest part of town targeting blacks . Cross is determined to solve the murders even though those in management at the police department regard these murders as unimportant because they involve the poor . While at the murder scene Cross is called to a private school where a famous actress ' daughter and the son of the Secretary of the Treasury have been kidnapped by a man posing as a teacher at the school Gary Soneji . Cross is told that the kidnappings are highpriority and he resents the fact that two rich kids take precedence over six murders of innocent albeit poor black victims . Patterson does an excellent job of merging the two scenarios as Cross investigates and works to solve both of the crimes.For those unfamiliar with the Alex Cross series this book is the one to read first it explains the background of the characters while weaving them through a very suspenseful tale with many unexpected twists and turns . Patterson makes the characters seem believable and real readers will be kept on the edge of their seats and will admit that the only drawback of the novel is that it ends . Most suspensethriller aficionados will waste no time picking up the next book in the series.This book was purchased with personal funds and no promotion of the book was solicited by the author or publisher .

"Over the years I have acquired quite a collection of James Patterson books but always wanted to start reading him from the beginning of the Alex Cross series . I do n't know what took me so long to discover why he 's such a popular author but I 'm glad I finally did . Although I must add that once I started reading him I was on a hunt for the rest of the books I was missing it 's impossible not to get engrossed and lost in a slick thriller such as Along Came a Spider and not crave more . The moment I was done with the 1st book I was all ready dreaming of snatching the 2nd it was worth to wake up early on Sunday and make a quick run to the bookstore for the next chapter of Alex Cross 's life . I usually do n't read a series back to back but my mind and appetite were taken hostage and I had to succumb to the calling of another great book.Let me just say how easy it is to have this or his other books spoiled I did n't read the editorial reviews till after I was done with the story and good thing too I felt that some of the surprising moments were being dangerously close to being mentioned.This highly suspenseful story begins with a kidnapping from the past that inspires future psychopaths the famous Lindenberg baby is snatched from his crib to be buried alive . This becomes the inspiration for Gary Murphy and the evolution of his alter ego Gary Soneji ruthless kidnapper and killer with over two hundred victims on his black soul . Gary wants to be somebody he wants the streets to hum and buzz with terror at the very thought of his name he 's also an exceptional planner who 's ideas take years to plan and without leaving any prints or traces of his true identity . He 's the master of disguises and faux credentials that let him slip into many sectors unnoticed and watch his future victims . Gary decides to act on his master plan and kidnap two prominent children from their highly guarded school . The ransom is in millions but sometimes Gary likes the mental and physical torture more than money he lives and breathes on inflicting terror on men women and anything that will cross his way especially children . He 's trilled at the thought that the famous Alex Cross is on his tail and he does his best to taunt and stalk the man leaving him more crimes to solve . Just when things start to come to light another devious plot exudes a foul stench a warning that the case if far from being over one that puts a real spin on the story . I can not say any more this book is best read with knowing the smallest bit of detail because so much happens and not all turns out well for Cross.For a five hundred page book this reads extremely fast I was done with it in two days and if my eye balls were n't revolting I would have read something right after it but they needed a break . It 's quite enjoyable to read a juicy book that does n't let go and one that ends with a bang now I see why so many people read and like Patterson he 's pretty awesome . Kasia S . ",4
"This is a really good book full of twists and turns and subplots . The characters are welldeveloped not all are likable and the premise of the story is realistic . The book is actionpacked and does an excellent job if luring you in and leaves you wanting more . The gook can be read as a standalone book or you can continue on in the series . I 'm looking forward to the series . What kept the book from being great is that the romance portion was rather predictable and somewhat unbelievable given the personality of the main character . I think developing romantic relationships in suspense books is very tricky and needs to be done lightly and not rushed most authors do n't do this aspect very well . I also anticipated how the book would end and who was involved and it would have been nice to be completely shocked by the ending . ",3
"this is the most complicated book I have ever read . just when you think the mystery is solved there is a twist . then there is another and another . It just keeps going until you get about 34 the way through . Then he begins his reveals of why 's and where it all comes about . It will keep you in your seat and yet challenge your mind . So if you have never read one of his books and you like a challenge start here ! ",3
"I just started reading this series and am excited to read the next book ! Hope they are all this good . ",4
"This was an interesting book with no slow parts . The villain was written well and always kept me on my toes . I really did n't know what to believe until the very end . I also liked that I kept changing my guesses about what was going onit was n't one of those books where I have it all figured out after the second chapter and then just nod along while they explain things to me that I 'd already discovered . I 'm curious about seeing the movie now but reading the plot summary at imdb.com I 'm a little worried it looks like a totally different story ! ",3
"I guess I expected a better book after reading the Women 's Murder club books . I 'm going to read the second book though . ",2
"This book has many twists and turns it kept me on the edge of my seat trying to figure out who did it . A must read ! ",4
"I enjoy reading a Patterson book but I am not addicted to them . It is a good easy read with a mystery with a few twists and turns . This is one case where I liked the movie better even though I had all ready read the book several years before . If you like James Patterson you will like this book . If you have n't read him you might use this a first read . You wo n't be disappointed . ",2
"This was the first in the series that my husband wanted to read right from the beginning and he did ! ",4
"I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good crime story . It is entertaining from beginning to end with just the right amount of suspense . ",4
"At first watching the brutality and tragery happened in NY and reading the crimes in this book I wish those should disapper.1 . Which is first chicken or egg ? The part descibing on possibility of multiple character in Gary MurphySonjei reminded me of the movie Primal fear in which Edward Norton deceived Richard Gear so amazingly . So many books recenly are published aiming for Hollywood movie or many mystery novels and movies look like relatives . Where is the creativity ? Among books and movies I just found only 'Sixth sense ' to prove the author 's creativty.2 . The detailed and long desciption on the romance made me lost in following the kidnapping case . I think this targeted for the reversal in relationship but which is a little boring.Although I gave this book 4 stars.Because the character of Alex Cross which is now confused with that of Morgan Freeman He 's too COOL though old is so realistic and appealing to attract and deserve many people 's affection . And one more I can not put aside the book and read the last 2030 pages holding breath.James Patterson is one of the best mystery novelists in US . ",3
"I just started reading Along came a spider series . If you are looking for suspense or thrillers this is the book for you . In order to enjoy this book you must know there are 11 in all . Alex Cross is a detective and solves high crimes but in the meantime he has a personnal life that is always shiftedI just hope in the series to come he will settle down . ",4
"One of James Patterson 's best novels and I was moved into the story with a new understanding of James Patterson 's work . Alex Cross is a master of science of the mind even though he sees the truth he was lost in love . ",4
"This is the start of many books of James Patterson about Alex Cross . I have read them all and could not put them down . You may feel that if you have seen the movie you need not read the book but you are wrong . You get so much more out of the book . The movie did not do it justice . Thankfully i watched the movie first and then read the book or the movie would have been a total letdown . I have read this and the others in 2 to 3 days each tops . Every chance i got i picked it up and read . I hated to have to put it down . ",4
"I enjoyed rereading this book . The Alex Cross novels are always fantastic page turners Thanks for the one day bargain price ! ",4
"Action packed with a mystery to solve . I got through this book pretty quick and the ending was a complete shock . I just started the Alex Cross series and I am glad I did . Along Came a Spider was superb plot . Patterson gives great discriptions of each character . Especially when he wrote about the killer . Creepy . I highly recommend this book.. ",4
"This is a reread of one of my favorite books . I am marching through the Alex Cross series . Cross is a complex character . Not a brute but not an intellectual wimp . He is sensitive intelligent but not afraid to take action . He disdains politics and mindless authority but respects the law . Patterson weaves great stories . ",4
"Ditto to all the other comments made by reviewers who gave this book five stars ! This book kept me in suspense from beginning to end . I became a James Patterson fan after reading this book . Although the entire Alex Cross series is exceptional this is without a doubt the stand out book.I was so disappointed when they cast Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross . Alex in the book is MUCH younger . There are so many aspects of Alex 's life and character that were left out to accommodate the elderly movie Alex such as Alex 's children grandmother relationship with a character in the book etc do n't want to give too much away winkThat was a HUGE turn off to me when the movie came out . Because this is my favorite book I do not want to draw comparisons between the book and movie.For anyone who saw the movie and was disappointed I encourage you to read the book you will NOT be disappointed ! ! ! ! ! ! ",4
"This is the first & not the last of the Alex Cross books I 'll read . This story is exciting & keeps you wondering what goiong to happen next . Have recommmened it to friends & family . ",4
"The characters are colorful and interesting the plot line is full of twists and intrigue and I really enjoyed the book . James Patterson has a wonderful protagonist in Dr. Cross and his villains are exceptional.The book as is usually the case is far better than the movie version although the movie is good as well . You must read the book but see the movie only if you want . If you 've read the book first you might be disappointed with the film . ",3
"This is the first book I read by Patterson and I have read everyone since . The characters are ones you will never forget . If you have n't read any of his read them all . His style is so easy to read . As a commuter to work it is easy for me to stop and start reading because of his short chapters . Robert_ticehurst @ scudder.com Email with comments ",4
"All the Alex Cross pieces are so interesting and keep you on the edge of your chair ! Of course they would as they are James Patterson 's ! ",4
"Def kept me guessing . Just when I thought I knew what was next Patterson threw a curve ball ! Great book ",4
"After imagining Alex Cross in my mind and then seeing him on the screen WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT ! Alex Cross novels will never hold the same enjoyment or interest.Not the handsome polished gentle bigger than life character that Patterson wrote about . ",1
"The first book that I 've read by James Patterson I will surely read more . It was a very good book . ",4
"I am a sucker for crime shows like Castle The Mentalist Perception Major Crimes and Rizzoli and Isles . After hearing Mr. Patterson mentioned on Castle I decided to look into his book series . So happy I did ! Thoroughly enjoyed this book . I was a little disappointment with the movie version of this novel as the director took liberty to change much of the book 's plot . Still the book is a great read . It is a well constructed thrill ride where Mr. Patterson has you going up down and sideways . ",4
"Some of the writing quirks in Alex Cross novels can be distractingly silly . I 've never been an enormous fan of James Patterson 's style and the way he chooses to flesh out the skeletons of his plotlines.But the plotlines themselves are the best and most intricate in the business . This book in particular along with Kiss the Girls provides some of the most welldeveloped and complex storyline labyrinths in the murder detective genre.Patterson always seems to have a way to detract from his own incredible plots with some cheesy writing and continually brings his books from five stars to four in this manner But four stars is nothing to sneeze at.Another fastpaced and compelling read from the pen of James Patterson . ",3
"I enjoyed the story line and involvement of the characters . I was surprised at the ending because I definitely thought it would end differently . ",3
"LOVE IT ! COULD N'T PUT IT DOWN ! THE MOVIE IS GOOD TOO BUT NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS THE BOOK . ",4
"Patterson maintained the suspense throughout and his literary images brought me into the scene . Alex Cross and his buddy John are great characters . ",4
"This is my first James Patterson book I ever read & my first book I read in a long time . Its such a thiller when I turned the page I got a shocking surprise . I enjoyed it so much I really could n't put it down . I am going to read all the Alex Cross series books . i will read more James Patterson books if they are as thilling as this one . ",3
"ALONG CAME A SPIDER is the second Alex Cross book to revolve around the villain Gary Soneji a teacher at a private school in Washington DC . Soneji is also known as Son of Lindbergh a murdering serial kidnapper that has outsmarted most of Washington 's law enforcement . I also must say that Soneji is one of Patterson 's most diabolical villains to date he does n't torture his victims the way we saw the villain in KISS THE GIRLS do but he is much smarter and that can be very scary all by itself ! Because of Soneji 's brainpower he 's kept ahead of the law in the past . Now Alex Cross is on his trail and the going gets much more difficult for Soneji . Alex Cross is a homicide detective with a doctorate in psychology . Most of the readers can relate to this main character because he 's an average guy who 's down to earth . In this book he does have one obsession he is attracted to a female supervisor of Washington 's Secret Service . Cross is determined to stop Soneji before his madness can kill another person and must work around the conflicting emotions set in place by his affair with another in law enforcement.ALONG CAME A SPIDER is definitely a great . Patterson 's first book KISS THE GIRLS was awesome but this one is even better than the last ! The reader can easily relate to the easy going downtoearth character of Alex Cross who plays the piano when he 's troubled or enjoys playing with his children . I think the normalcy of this character helps draw the reader into the story until you ca n't put it down . Patterson 's villains seem to be created from a nightmare too terrible to remember . With this combination Patterson is sure to stay on top of the bestseller 's list ! ",3
"Seriously i wonder how Patterson ever became a Bestseller writer . Though this was my first experience with him i 've decided it will be also my last.I love serial killers books . I 've reed some good classics . Psycho is still one of my favourite and i cherish Red Dragon . But this book is just awful . Everything is wrong . Everything.The serial killer is not beliveable . He does n't act as a real serial killer shoudl act . There 's nothing more horrible than a serial killer who makes jokes about cutting up someone 's penis and shoving it up one 's mouth . it 's just too funny to come from a man who should be lonely methodical devoted to his work . Instead he has a perfect family and a house with a garden . What happened to the real killers those who hide human body parts in the basement or in the attic who have sexual innibitions who are just real ? Then there 's his intelligence . He 's anything but because the writer does n't try to show us that by actions but merely by telling us.As for the detective Alex Cross he 's so transparent without characterization . he spends his time complaining and beeing sorry for the victims . What about thrying to get the killer ? Patterson 's narrative are even worst . The prose is very simple as if the readers were too dumb to understand . And then there 's his subplots all that stuff about racism all seen by the eyes of Cross who is black . I understand the message but Patterson does n't make it sound true . It 's not like he ever suffered this problems in his own skin is it ? Thus avoid this book . There are better thrillers in the market awiting . ",0
"This is one of his best ! The characters were intriguing and real . The plot moved along with ease . I did see the ending but still was a great read . ",4
"Alex Cross becomes unwittingly entangled in a serial killers all star crime spree cast.Thoroughly entertaining yet somewhat predictable in its conclusion Along Came a Spider shows you why the Alex Cross series has been so successful . Alex is the type of man you hope to have in your corner to help figure out who submit . ",3
"Not impressed . It 's about a mediocre DC psychologistcop . There 's nothing impressive all that impressive about Alex Cross . Combine that with the author constantly writing from different perspectives and it 's really hard to get attachedrelate to Alex . I figured out the twist from the very beginning so instead of being shocked I was thinking It 's about friggin time Alex figures it out . For a psychologist he seemed to lack intuition and was a bit of a sucker . By the end of the book I was glad it was finally over . ",2
"Great condition for a book that is over 10 years old . I am very pleased . Even my husband was impressed and that is hard to do . ",4
"If there were 6 stars I would have rated it 6 . This book has everything you could want in a detective thriller . I will be reading every James Patterson book I can get my hands on . ",4
"This is the first James Patterson book I have read but it wo n't be the last . I thought it was very very good . A little slow in the middle but the beginning and the ending made up for it . Starts with the murders of a family then two kids are kidnapped . Can they be connected ? ? ? ? ? ? Alex Cross is great as a detective . The mind games with him and Gary are breath taking . Jezzie Flanagan with the Secret Service gives you a big surprise . I do n't know if Sandford 's Prey series came first or Patterson 's Cross series came first but they remind me of each other . John Sampson is very good as Cross 's partner . If you like a good mystery with lots of twist and turns and a good ending you will like this book . ",4
"My son was happy with this book . I was pleased with the service I received . ",4
"Great murder mystery . James Patterson is a superb writer and he knows how to keep readers engaged . Thanks for sharing your gift . ",4
"His books start you running from the first chapter and never lets you go . Each book attaches your heart closer to Alex Cross and his family . I look forward to each and every moment with Alex and his warm and lovely family . ",4
"I love this book . I ca n't put it down . Everybody who likes suspense romance intrigue will love this book so far . ",4
"An exceptional book which keeps you guessing far longer than many other thrillers . Well written with and I paraphrase Mozart just enough words as are needed . Two children are kidnapped by an intelligent patient psycopath . Not a truly original plot to begin with but Patterson turns what you think is boilerplate into a tale containing enough twists to keep you turning pages well into the night ! When the kidnapper is thwarted by an accidental death and the $ 10000000 ransom is never recovered even when the perpetrator is caught the story begins to turn into a wonderful thriller that keeps the reader clueless until far into the book something not many authors can achieve . Is our criminal suffering from multipersonality disorder or is he an actor worthy of an Oscar ? Where is the surviving kidnap victim ? Has love found Alex Cross ? Is the FBI baffled or merely inept ? Why are the authorities so nonchalent ? After they have the kidnapper in custody why do n't they ask where is the child ? Has Alex Cross been taken in by a cunning conniving con artist ? I wo n't tell you but you must find out for yourself . Any true mystery fan owes it to himself to read this book . Are you the sleuth you think you are ? Find out for yourself . If you were n't hooked on Patterson prior to Along Came a Spider you will be after you 've read it . Oh ! Do yourself a favor and save money at the same time . Do n't bother seeing the movie spend the money on the book . This is one you do not want to miss ! ",4
"ALONG CAME A SPIDER is a mystery thriller that has everything a crimemystery lover needs a plot so twisted and bizarre that it takes the most competent detective numerous attempts and unfailing commitment before he can unravel it.The mind of the kidnappermurderer Gary SonejiMurphy is so heinous that the reader 's heart beats faster as he races along with him from one of his crimes to the next with Detective Alex Cross a close step behind but not close enough . Always in the back of the reader 's mind he thinks about the guy next door and wonder if he 's capable of having thoughts and plans like SonejiMurphy.Patterson does n't let us wonder what will happen next . ALONG CAME A SPIDER is filled with action and suspense.At times I found myself reading so fast just to see what would happen next that I actually had to go back and read portions again just to make sure I 'd gotten it right . This is an excellent novel and it sets the pace for the rest of the Alex Cross series . ",4
"Patterson at his best with one of his best characters . Alex Cross and his supporting cast take you on a great psychological journey into the mind of criminals and the greedy . One book will get you hooked . ",4
"Although I do n't like serial killer stories this one is so engrossing that it is hard to put down . It has so many turns that it can not be predicted what will happen next . It will be liked by readers who like psychological thrillers . ",4
"One of the best books I read in years . Ca n't wait together the next one . Son of Lindbergh is creepy ",4
"I love James Patterson as an author . I 've never read the Alex Cross series so now that I have read the first book of the series I 'm really excited to read further into the series and eventually reading them all . I 've already started on the second one and am enjoying it thoroughly . ",4
"Along Came a Spider Alex CrossThis book was fantastic kept you on the edge of your seat wondering what was coming next . I would recomend it to anyone who loves mysteries and suspence . ",4
"James Patterson is one of my favorite writers . This one of his better books . ",3
"I decided to read the whole series after watching the recent Alex Cross movie with Tyler Perry because I was horrified at all the story changes . The choppy sentence style is a little hard to get used to but otherwise a very fun book . ",3
"I really enjoyed this book I have read others of the Alex Cross series and wanted to start at the begining so I bought this one . It was exciting and had a lot of great twists . ",4
"I 've read a few books by Patterson . This is probably one of my favorites . I just feel his work can be a bit cookie cutter but overall it was a good read . Passed the time while traveling . 3.5 stars . ",2
"This book stars our favorite DetectivePsychologist Dr. AlexCross.In this book a serial kidnapper masquerading as a teacherat a private school kidnaps two children of prominent people.Gary Soneji kidnaps Maggie Rose Dunn whose mother is a movie star and Michael Goldberg whose father is Secretary of the Treasury.They are both students at Washington Day School.Our hero Alex Cross is jerked off of a murder case in his neighborhood to handle the kidnapping.Along with his partner John Sampson and Secret Service agent Jezzie Flanagan they beginthe hunt for Gary Soneji.Gary Soneji in turn kills an F.B.I . agentthe school teacher of his two kidnap victims and anotherSecret Service agent.There are several close calls at capturing Soneji but they always miss.Even the attempt to pay a ransom is botched.Cross finally discovers that there is another kidnappingplot being conducted by individuals in another law enforcement body.Soneji is tried and put inn prison but pulls a spectacularescape.There is one action scene after the other.This is a real page turner that you will certainly enjoy . ",4
"I did read another of his books 'Cross ' and hated it but this one is actually quite good . The plot tends to jumpcut a little sometimes and things have a habit of coming to slightly forced and convenient conclusions but you do want to keep turning the pages . I disagree that this plot could have been dealt with in 500 words . There were some nice little touches to the plot and good characterisation . I did n't buy the ending much and found it too much of an exercise in tying up every loose end ther author could find.Nevertheless I enjoyed it and would recommend it on the basis that it 's an interesting undemanding read perhaps one to go for if you 've just spent days ploughing through something a little more 'literary ' which this sure is n't ! ! ",3
"I 'm probably going to be in the minority here no pun intended but I had had so many friends tell me about Alex Cross novels and this was my first one . I thought it was okay but not great . However I will read more of Patterson 's books and maybe they 'll grow on me . ",2
"Alex Cross along with Lincoln Rhyme and Myron Bolitar is one of the finest literary creations in the thriller genre of our time ! Patterson has given us a hero with flaws a wonderful family and personal relationship with his friends a man with moral conviction and a fierce determination to bring criminals to justice.Along Came a Spider is the first in the series and it is a whopper of a tale . We meet the extremely heinous Gary Soneji a murderer a kidnaper who seemingly ca n't make any mistakes . He kidnaps the children of a prominent politician and a movie star and then proceeds to feign his crimes under the multiple personality umbrella . What a sickie ! What makes Patterson so great is that he weaves tales with brisk short chapters characters that have more than one dimension and a wonderful sense of timing . He pulls lots of plot twists not quite as sinuously as Jeffrey Deaver but still they are lulus ! I ca n't imagine anyone not enjoying these books . They are the creme de la creme of the lot ! Enjoy but be prepared to get hooked.One aside I agree that the casting of Morgan Freeman as Cross in the two films is questionable . Freeman is a marvelous actor but I think casting a younger actor such as Denzel Washington or even Cuba Gooding Jr. would have allowed the movies to follow the books ' characterization more fully . But do n't blame Freeman . He does an outstanding job as always.And as always the book is ALWAYS better than the movie ! ",4
"Do yourself a favor and read this book . To say Along Came A Spider is an exciting book would be an understatement . The suspense is amazing the characters are greatespecially the villain and the plot twists are unexpected . This first installment in the Alex Cross series still remains the best . James Patterson really knows how to grab a reader and not let go . Along Came a Spider will turn you into an instant Patterson fan . ",4
"I know that JP is one of the best selling authors in the US over the last quarter century . I just ca n't see why . This is supposed to be one of his best books so I thought I 'd give it a shot.This book like the rest I would imagine is formulaic the characters are onedimensional and overly clich & eacuted and the overall plot was plodding and quite predictable.JP I gave you an honest try but I wo n't be reading anymore of the Alex Cross books.But good luck to you and god bless .

"These books keep my interest and I keep reading them until the end and ca n't wait to get there . Then I want another one to read . ",4
"From one of the greatest thriller writers of this generation James Patterson comes the explosive eyepopping novel Along Came a Spider.I first read this book about five years ago long before the movie came out which is actually a horrific depiction of this great thriller . I got interested in Patterson after I read and saw Kiss the Girls . I read ACAS and was totally amazed . It was one of the best books from a new author that I 'd read in a long time.The novel begins with a serial killer kidnapping two children from an exclusive private school where he teaches . Detective Alex Cross is hired to find the missing kids . This being the first Alex Cross novel Patterson portrays him amazingly . Cross is the most intelligent noble and kind man that has ever existed in fiction . No matter what Alex Cross book you 're reading even if the plot is horrible you 'll enjoy the book just because Cross is in it . He brings so much to the novel with his excellent detective and psychologist skills to the love he openly shows for his partner his grandmother and his two young children the latter of the three being the most admirable . Reading scenes between Cross and his children is just so touchingor maybe I 'm just being too much of a girl . Anyway back to the novel . In the infinite world of psychos in novels Patterson knows how to creep us out . Gary Soneji the killer in ACAS is a frightening and disturbing character that adds all the suspense needed for the novel . He is a smart killer obsessed with committing the crime of the century.Along Came a Spider will send chills through the reader 's body and keep their eyes open alert and glued to each page until all hours of the morning . It is solid compelling psychological thriller . ",4
"This is the first book in the series that introduces alex cross.This is a great book especally if you like police stories and james patterson books.He writes this series on is own . ",4
"I still maintain this opinion when I run out of new stories by the really great writers like Lawrence Block Joe Lansdale Robert Parker and Dean Koontz I start looking for mediocre writers to fill my reading time . Authors like Stephen King John Saul Jonathan Kellerman and James Patterson spring immediately to mind.I get no feeling from any of these characters ! They are not real to me they hold no interest for me . It 's like James is practicing characterization with only one goal in mind profound mediocrity.The scenes are also dull and choppy . I get no sense of where the story is going because the chapters are monotonously too short and go nowhere.I found these tedious qualities to be evident in the other four books that I have read from this author . I am glad I borrowed them from the library ! I shall not read this man 's works any more there 's only so much bad literature that one can tolerate before one is compelled to expel it all ",1
"My first time reading James Patterson . A pretty good read . Well written but not a lot of surprises for me . Same old usual twists so saw them coming . slight spoiler alert Never explained how Maggie went from escaping to being back with her family in the village . And never explained the Watcher in the car . Very vague on what happened to money . Much of the story left incomplete in my opinion . Also struggled with the bruises described as being sustained AFTER death . As far as I know that would n't have happened unless the beating happened at the time of death or very shortly thereafter . Not after finding him already dead . Still really enjoyed reading it though and look forward to Alex 's next adventure . I 'm assuming that as with most writers the next book will be better . ",2
"I enjoyed the book . Alex is in his best form . Along Came a Spider exposes our prejudices and the evil side of humans . ",3
"After seeing the movie I wanted to learn more about the characters and looked specifically for the first Alex Cross mystery by James Pattersonthis IS the first book in the series . The main character Detective and Phd . in Psychology Alex Cross is a fascinating character . Two of the other major characters were n't as well developed as I would have liked and after finishing the book I felt I was left with a lack of enough information to fully understand and in the case of one of thembarely understood the why of crime committed . I do n't want to give out too much information about the book and risk spoiling it for anyone but I definitely would n't have seen the end coming if I had n't already seen the movie.Make sure to read Kiss the Girls next ! Cross ' character is much further developed and it 's a more fascinating read.Somewhat intriguing but in comparison I felt Kiss the Girls was a better written book . ",2
"I love Patterson 's style ! I could not put the book down during the last 20 % of it . Alex Cross looks like it 's going to be another series I have to finish ! ",4
"I read almost all James Patterson books . This one was really good and had a surprise ending . Ca n't put it down ",4
"This was different . In the beginning it was a little drab lacking the action I thought it was to have . But towards the middle it picked up speed . I truly enjoyed the mastermind of The son of Lindbergh . I loved how Patterson captured the truth in his disturbed character.The psychological perspective is what grabbed me into this book . It does a minor in depth diagnosis of the different criminals that are presented . It 's almost like the show Criminal Minds but its Dr. Cross doing the digging.Also the graphic detail of the kidnappings and murders . Oh that is the best part . Patterson was n't afriad to take it to the level with children . I know that some people are very uptight about that but others I like reading the thrills and chills . And this one sends the chill right up your spine . Its horrible graphic disgusting and all the other bad words . But I loved it . ",3
"This book is like the web the spider weaves . So many twists and turns such intricate little details you think you have it figured out . NOT at all my friend .

"Alex Cross is a forensic psychologist as well as a Washington D.C. police detective . He 's also a black man whose wife was murdered several years ago leaving him with two small children to rear thankfully not alone . His grandmother a formidable retired educator whom Alex calls Nana Mama because after his mother 's early death he knew no other parent lives with the family and takes care of the children . When two nasty murder cases involving black families come his way Alex wants to catch the killer even more passionately than usual . But before he really gets the investigation underway two white children are kidnapped from an exclusive private school when they were supposed to be under Secret Service protection . Thanks to the unwanted fame brought to him by a recent news article the mayor orders Cross pulled off the murder cases and assigned to the kidnapping . Cross is his best the public surely believes and the mayor must be seen giving this case his best . For its victims are the young daughter of a film star and the young son of the Secretary of the Treasury.Cross does n't want to investigate a kidnapping for ransom whose victims need him a lot less in his opinion than the black families who will likely become the deranged killer 's next targets . His resistance gets him nowhere with the mayor . But as he works on the kidnapping however unwillingly he comes to know the Secret Service supervisory agent on whose watch it happened and before he knows it widower Alex Cross is falling in love with a most unsuitable partner . A beautiful white woman in the same dangerous business.The cases he wants to investigate ca n't possibly be connected with the kidnapping that he thinks someone else can and should handle . Or can they ? The more he learns the less he feels that he really knows . Has the brilliant Alex Cross finally met his match in a criminal even more intelligent and driven than he is ? This is a scary book indeed and not due to excessive gore . It 's got some of that yes but the worst of its terrors are psychological as Cross pursues a psychopath . I 'm told this is the first book in a series and after it kept me awake until the wee hours of this morning I find myself eager to get my hands on the next installment . I want more of this protagonist ! And more of this author too ! Reviewed by Nina M. Osier author of 2005 science fiction EPPIE winner Regs ",4
"Mistake Not getting to read this book first . Saw the latest Alex Cross movie first . Confused by wife 's death story referred to in this book versus the movie . Did develop the connection to Alex Cross that I expected . Again my mistake was probably in not reading this book and others first and not the fault of the author . Will however read more of his books just because of Alex Cross . ",2
"I 'm an avid fan of James and I think I 'll always be . Thanks for keeping me up all night . I owe you one . ",4
"If you have to read anything the Alex Cross series should be it ! This book kept me on my toes from the start . It has all the great things murder pyhcos and more . I found the one character Mr. Soneji quite humerous with his split personality . And I hear he comes back in later books i cant wait to read more about him . You have to be a real pyshco to hold up a McDonalds . I TOLD YOU I WANT EXTRA FRIES AND NO TOMATO ",4
"1 Plot 5 stars After two celebrity children are kidnapped hardnosed but savvy detective Alex Cross is brought in to solve the case only to run into an intelligent psychopath and the myriad twists and turns he has waiting for him . Patterson got famous for his plotting skills and his mastery of this element shows in this work . The pacing is fast the tension is constantly high and the surprises keep on coming.2 Characters 4 stars Alex Cross is not just a Dirty Harry he is also thoughtful and sensitive and perceptive . Gary Soneji is not just a raving psychopath he is also a calculating enigma . Jezzie is not just a simple love interest she also has a mystery of her own . All these characters could have been onedimensional and the story would still have worked . But they were n't and for me that really elevated this book above the ranks of the traditional thriller.3 Theme 2 stars This book is so much about the charging plot of trying to solve a kidnapping mystery that messages or morals really take a back seat . There did seem to be one though about how the lust for fame will make people do crazy things as personified by the villain but this theme was n't explored much deeper than the surface level.4 Voice 4 stars Yes Patterson is an easy read . But at least in this work I did n't find that skill of easiness to come with the usual trappings of 8th grade diction and clich & eacute . His sentences reflect the POV of the chapter lead and they do a great job conveying the mood and characters ' psyche while also telling a fast paced tale.5 Setting 4 stars Washington DC is the locus of events but the action seeps out up and down the Eastern Seaboard . Patterson does a good job describing each scene in just enough detail to transport you there but not too much to slow the ride.6 Overall 4 stars The main reason you read a Patterson novel is the plot and that element does n't disappoint here . But I was also pleasantly surprised by the depth of the characters and the prose . I 'd recommend it . ",3
"Patterson 's first in the Alex Cross series is a good start but without a doubt the series gets better . I just wish the pace was a faster . ",3
"First off let me say that those aiming to find great literature will not find it in the pages of this book . Comparing Along Came a Spider to A Farewell To Arms is like comparing a Mozart symphony to current pop music . That said you will find a pretty good crime thriller that you can run through in a couple days . That 's the reason the work is a massive bestseller . I thought the plot was compelling but even at 500+ pages I did n't really feel that much for the victims . Patterson devotes much more development time to the bad guys . Also superfluous writing crops up every now and then . For example I remember one part where a criminal says something along the lines of Believe whatever the hell you want . Then after that quote we get this profound commentary from the narrator He did n't care what I thought . Well obviously ! Not a major problem but it comes across as a little amateur.Still even after those criticisms I did mostly enjoy the book . If you 're looking for a quick easy read with some interesting twists I say go for it . Good planevacation reading . 3 to 3 12 stars . ",2
"Another great book . Although the start of the book was good the ending was great . So many twists . A must read if you like James Patterson . ",3
"In this first appearance of Alex Cross a suspenseful story is well told . I recommend reading this first if you are embarking on reading the Alex Cross series . Mr. Patterson does a good job of making each book stand on it 's own but Alex is more raw and real in the first one than in some of the later books . This is also one of the better books of the series . If you have n't read Patterson before he has a style of short chapters straightforward sentences and a fairly linear train of thought through the book . This makes for quick reading and easy reading which is helpful if you only get to read in short bursts between other activities . ",3
"Good book . Well written . My son loved it and read it cover to cover in a few days . Well worth it . ",4
"this book really keeps me up at nite.lol i read when i go to bed for an hour or so . lately im reading too long . cant wait to find out whats next ! read and really enjoy this book . ",4
"Oh boy.. ! ! it 's a great page turner . You ca n't put it down until you get it over with . I completed this book in a day maybe . I 'm a big fan of Psychological thrillers and this is my best book so far.Alex Cross is a common man and not some detective from any James Bond movie . He makes mistakes . He looks human . He is up against some genius psychopath . Somehow he managed to solve the case . It 's a great roller coaster ride all through this book . This book will keep you thinking even after you are done with this . ",4
"Several friends swear by The Alex Cross series . As an avid reader I finally broke down and read book 1 . Let me just tell you I too am now hooked . I look forward to reading book 2.and all the other books in this series . ",4
"I love the Alex Cross series . It 's always a great read . I have read the whole series and will continue to look for his next adventure . ",4
"after so many rave reviews this book got i finally got around this book.is very easy to read..and also very suspensefulyou will finish the book in no time ",3
"This is the only Alex Cross book that gets 5 stars . I love Alex Cross but most of the series only get 3 or 4 and everything after Violets are Blue gets only 1 star . Here is why Patterson had a very strong creation in Alex Cross . He was an interesting character with flaws and emotions . Also he was n't a toughguy hero he was a man who used his mind to solve crimes . He is a psychologist not a rogue cop that makes up his own rules . Also in this book he is pitted against a very unique and clever villain Gary Soneji a madman who kidnaps a young girl from a private school who has a very powerful father.This book has a great plot and moves at a breakneck speed . There is little time for description or introspection on the part of the characters and that is what makes this book great . There are countless twists and turns and the reader is constantly guessing . Now that being said it is Patterson 's style of writing that makes this book amazing and the rest of them derivative pulp . Patterson insists on having over 100 chapters in each of his books . This is not to say they are long books rather each chapter is merely 23 pages long . This in itself is not the problem . The problem is that each chapter starts halfway down the page leaving half a page of white space and the chapter will end at the beginning of a new page only a few lines down leaving another half page of white space . I have heard many readers say that they love Patterson because they read his books so quickly . Well the fact is that the buyer is paying for about 35 percent white space in any given Patterson book which is only about 300 pages long in the first place ! Now again I am not saying this is bad . It is a technique that gives the feeling of incredible suspense as one is literally turning the pages faster than can be imagined when reading a book of substance . However after the first book in this series I was tired of this device and I can finish an Alex Cross book in just over an hour . I may as well have been watching television ! Anyhow this first book is worth reading however please be skeptical of anyone who thinks they are literati because they can devour a whole Patterson book in one sitting . Buy this book but make sure that you buy the rest of this series from a used book store so Patterson is not rewarded for his 120 pages of white space per novel.Relic113 ",4
"Amazing page turner . While I did have some of the mystery figured out the end still leaves you guessing on other parts ! ",4
"James has done it again he has you sitting on pins and needles wondering when Dr Cross is going to solve this case . . ",4
"Reading _Along Came a Spider a second time is just as good as the first . For newcomers to James Patterson 's latest books it 's a great recap of Alex Cross 's history . Who he is why he is are being built upon this book and more of his early ones . Am introducung Patterson to my husband and my son is great fun using this and his earlier book . All still pageturners ",4
"Here Patterson shows us what really made him famous . His first several books were really stunning thrillers up to and including Cat And Mouse . but since then all his Alex Cross books have just been rehashings of the same old plots.This book is great . It 's a chilling read with an excellent and truly original plot . Alex Cross comes across as a great compassionate character who has much life in him . But Unfortunately patterson tired him out very quickly.With this book Patterson created one of his most chilling victims . He is chilling because Patterson spends time making him so . Developing his character . With his latest books Patterson does n't bother developing his villains or ANY of his characters for that matter and just expects us to believe him when he says they are a chilling and terrifying killer and leaves it at that . With this book he really shwos us what he can do . He is listening to his fans to much when they say ca n't you write faster . He has chosen to do so and in doing that has sacrificed good characters and original plots.This book was a great pageturner and a great thriller with a really brilliant and unexpected twist right at the end . I can not reccomend this highly enough . How i wish patterson had stayed with this kind of book rather than started attending the Danielle Steel school of literature . i.e . it does n't matter about the quality the more the write the more you sell so let 's laugh all the way to the bank A once great author . I hope he soon refinds his previous great form which he displayed here . ",4
"I prefer Dennis Lehane but this book was alright . A nice quick read if that 's what yo are looking for . ",2
"Great suspense with good charecters . Extremelly fast paced which is classic patterson . This is one of the better alex cross novels . ",3
"The actions and interactions of the authorities were not realistic as the Secret Service is responsible for protecting not for investigations . I ca n't imagine that a Secret Service agent just goes riding along with other authorities from time to time with no reporting back to or receiving directions from her office.I skipread the uninteresting romantic parts of the book except at the end . The great ending is what saved this book from being a three star or less.Many of the reviews have said that this is his best book . I hope not as I have eleven more of his books on my desk waiting to be read . ",3
"love anything written by James Patterson ! I 've read all of his books and look forward to reading more paperback or kindle version ",4
"I chose that rating because James Patterson is a great writer . I like it because Alex Cross is a very smart and decated detective . Yes i would recomend these books to friends and family ",4
"Little Miss Muffit sat on her tuffit eating her curds and whey . Along Came a Spider and sat down beside her and bored her to tears ! This book was o.k . but nowhere near as good as the other Alex Cross novels . The only reason why I do reccomend it is beacuse of the continuation in Cat and Mouse . Otherwise I would have said avoid it all together . ",1
"James Patterson did an outstanding job on this book . I am looing forward to reading Cat and Mouse . I have a great deal of books that have good storyline and a good overall mystery element but the ending is weak in reference to the books makeup . Along came a spider had the total package good storyline good mystery element an ending that was unsettling and fantastic . ",4
"A friend recommended the Alex Cross series . The wife and I like James Patterson so we got this and may be hooked on the series . ",4
"One of my friends suggested I read the James Patterson novels featuring Alex Cross . I checked with several other friends and was told the same thing . I started the book and was amazed at how the plot evolved . When I thought I had it all figured out much to my surprise how wrong I was ! Great story great plot and so hard to put down . I ca n't wait to start his next book . ",4
"I truly enjoyed this book . The characters and the storyline kept me trying to figure out how it would end and who the true villains were . Alex Cross does an amazing job in writing these thrillers . I would definetely recommend this book . ",4
"The movie was much better suprisingly . It was much more concise and explained everything better . I could be biased because i like Morgan Freeman but hey the book was just too divergent from the main plot when it should have been spending more time explaining the how 's and the whys . ",2
"I like all of the Alex Cross books . It was exciting and had emough suspense to keep my interest . I will continue to read Patterson . ",4
"'Along Came a Spider ' is the first book I read by James Patterson and I promise you it will not be the last . The main hero of our book is Alex Cross a Black detective and psychologist who lives and works in the Southeastern quadrant of Washington D.C . He is called in by the FBI to assist in solving the kidnapping of two children . At first Alex is angered that he is taken away from his usual job but soon gets involved in the kidnapping at every level . Honestly so will you . 'Along came a Spider ' is extremely powerful . The twist and turns of this book as well as the personality of the main characters especially Alex and the perpetrator will keep you at the edge of your seats . ",3
"This is my first James Patterson book and I am very surprised in this psycholoical thriller . This novel has it all . It has the suspense at every turn . The short chapter writing style made the reading very fast and easy . The character Gary Soneji was unpredictable throughtout . As soon as you seem to have it all figured out JP throws you a curve . It is drama at it best that will grab you and wo n't let you go until the end . The reader will need to fasten their seatbelts for this fast ride . I have considered reading Kiss the Girls by JP but I saw the movie instead . I understand that this book will be made into a movie coming out about March or April 2001 . I suggest you read the book first . The reader can trust me on this one as a real winner.I plan to read Cat and Mouse by JP . This book is a continuation of the same villian Gary SonejiMurphy Check it out on my next review as well as all my reveiws because they are all good . See YA . ",4
"To the reader whose first book in the Alex Cross series is a recent one it is not crystal clear that the hero is an AfricanAmerican but in this early offering race is central to the plot . It is not clear why the emphasis on race was downplayed as the series progressed.Once again we see the supercrafty criminal a murderer and kidnapper . Such figures dominate thrillers whereas in real life the criminals tend to be below normal in intelligence and make mistake after mistake . Perhaps mediocre to stupid just is n't interesting enough . If I have a fault with the plot it is the villain 's talent and the attempt to cram too much of this into too few pages . Jeopardy of course is what fuels the story but too much is still too much.The detailed Rrated interracial love interest is distracting from the plot . It does figure in the finale but it might have been done better . It just seemed manipulative put into the book for the prurient reader.I liked the characters particularly Nana Mama a wise woman . The atmosphere of Washington and environs is good . All in all this is one of the better novels featuring Dr.Detective Cross . The later ones are considerably less interesting . ",3
"This is the first of Alex Cross and you need to hold on to the bottom of your seat . It is fast moving and you need to read just one more chapter before you put it down . I did not read these books in order . However each of the series is a book that will standalone . Alex Cross just matures with each book . I prefer this series of Patterson 's books . He has a real talent in keeping your interest . By Ruth Thompson author of Natchez Above the River ",3
"This is the first and what I think is the best Alex Cross novel . It begins with the disapperances of two little kids from their school and takes off from there . This novel starts at that and does n't quit until you read the very last few words . I 'm not going to say much than that simply because it 's been about 8 years since I 've read it . It would probably be wise for me to read it again but there is just so much out there to be reading instead . This was also made into a movie a couple of months ago . I never did see it but I definitely will when it comes out on video . I just hope it stays true with the book . ",4
"If you 're interested in crime mysteries This would be the first book in the Alex Cross Detective series that you 'd want to start with . Gary Soneji the psycho bad guy is mentioned in at least one other Alex Cross book.Alex Cross is a detective in southeast DC trying to catch the psycho path who kidnapped two children from an elite private school . Alex finds himself obsessed with the case even though he gets taken off of it by his superiors.I highly recommend this book . ",4
"Of all the James Patterson novels this one is definitely at the top of the list . In this and subsequent novels kidnapper Gary Soneji is to Alex Cross as Hannibal is to FBI Agent Clarice Starling.Without going into the specifics of the book all of which have been provided for you in the editorial reviews this book is one of my all time favourites of James Patterson . It is packed with suspense drama a super A1 plot and great characters . Be prepared for a long night ahead because it is a book you will not want to put down from start to finish . Also at the top of the list is Kiss the Girls and Cat and Mouse.If you have read Patterson 's later novelsWhen the Wind Blows and Cradle and All and are disappointed with what you have read do not be discouraged . This book has all the punch and power of a real super thriller ! You will not want to miss this book or the movie of the same name . ",4
"This book has it all . Everything from suspense to thriller to on the edge of your seat action . This book was hard to put down because the action never stops . From page to page you never know what will happen next . I recommend this book to anyone that is into mysterythrillernon stop action and suspense ! ! ! ",4
"This was my first Alex Cross book and overall it was very good and would read another . The villian in the novel is intelligent cunning and very dangerous and so the hero in return must also be intelligent and insightful . Patterson succeeded in keeping me on the edge of my seat through out much of the book and I found most of his twists and turns very entertaining . Sadly what I did not find entertaining intelligent or even fresh was the routine use of the Black vs White mentality used by the star of the book Alex Cross . I found the use of this really insulting and it turned me off almost to the point of putting the book down . I could not understand why its inclusion made this a better book or a better character . I certainly hope that in the future Alex cross books that Patterson was comfortable with himself as a writer that he no longer had to include such petty plot devices . ",3
"I read this expecting something enjoyable . That was my mistake . I 'm all for books that have no purpose other than to entertain but the Cross character seems arbitrarily black like that by definition gives him a personality I did n't buy any of the rest of it either . I think a book is cheating when the only reason you 're reading it is because you want to know what happens not because you care but because it would irritate you not to know . This book cheats . Bigtime . I recommend Ridley Pearson or Richard North Patterson if you want something in the genre that 's at least decent . I would have given it no stars but they would n't let me . ",0
"Well writtena true pageturnerI like this book very muchstrongly recommended ",3
"Another very good James Patterson novel in his Alex Cross series . He always has such a good story line and great characters . ",4
"I recommend this book to anyone who loves mysteries . James Patterson is a talented writer . This book you would never want to put down . ",4
"Great book . Keep you hooked . Lots of unusual turns.Very suspenseful . Very believable . I really enjoyed this book and ca n't wait to read the next one . ",3
"Though this is a story written years ago by James Patterson I had not read it . As usual the mystery drama is captivating twists are always offered and begs you to read without ceasing to the very end . ",4
"I enjoyed the book just as I do most Patterson books . I do n't think this is one of his better books but still a good read . ",3
"This book even though long kept my interest up until the very end . I loved it . A very good thriller investigative romantic and murder mystery . I definitely will read the other Alex Cross books ! I have read several other Patterson novels and I always love them all ! ",4
"I loved it ! I like mystery or crime stories and so now I want to read all of the Alex Cross series ",4
"An entertaining story for me now that I 've become quite successful lately in suspending my disbelief . Otherwise I 'd be grumbling Oh come on ! ",3
"If you have never picked up a book from James Patterson this is the one for you . It is a very well written suspenseful and an easy to read book . The chapters are very short and keep you reading as you think OKonly one more chapter ! . This book was truly a page turner and I would highly recommend reading it . ",4
"DanX could not have said it any better . I too was looking for a great thriller as the last two not the great JP 's ! I have read have been quite lacklastre and boring . Then I got Along Came A Spider..it is a very quick excellent read that has more twists and turns than you can imagine plus they ALL MAKE SENSE ! ! ! Because the chapters are very short you want to keep reading more and the storyline is unbelievably goodI have already put my request in for more James Patterson.Read this book ! ! ",4
"Alex Cross is a great series and all the books are good reads each story is similiar but thats okay because it is different enough to keep you reading and interested ! ",3
"I picked up this novel with high expectations after the release of the movie and the adulation from writers such as Demille on the back of the edition proclaiming it masterful . Despite a good story and pacing however I did n't find much about this novel to live up to the hype it has received by come . Many of the major characters notably the mysterious FBI agent Alex Cross falls for and the children kidnapped seemed undeveloped and hollow and did n't add anything compelling except to serve as filler characters . The serial killer featured was the lone high acclaim I havereminiscent to the portrayal by Edward Norton of a killer in the movie Primal Fear the antagonist in Along Came a Spider is compelling and intriguing forcing the reader to make decisions that set up the later resolution . The actually twist ending however was disappointing to me as well . Most endings have elements that were at least SOMEWHAT foreshadowed earlier in the novel . Patterson 's ending however seemed to come out of left field and was completely arbitrary with no connections to earlier in the story in effect it did n't do the madman of the story justice . It is n't a bad readbut after Baldacci 's The Winner Along Came a Spider paled in comparison ",1
"I started to read some of the newer Alex Cross books & wanted to start reading them from the beginning . Along Came A Spider was excellent wlot 's of twist 's & turn 's in the plot ! I 'm ready for the 2nd one in the series ! S.L . Chessor author of My Tongue Fell Out & Poodlums Boogeymen and Booglers.My Tongue Fell OutPoodlums Boogeymen and Booglers A Poetry Collection ",4
"After reading all of the Alex Cross novels I must confess to being solidly ambivalent when it comes to recommending them to others . Patterson comes up with some unique and compelling villains that both pique the interest and turn the stomach . But he eventually makes them larger than life and omnipotent to the point of being like Jason in the Friday the 13th movies.Patterson also forgets his audience has most likely been exposed to a heavy dose of crime solving on TV and in the movies when he renders everyone except Cross so clueless when it comes to finding traces of the killers . Good thing for the rest of the country all serial killers find a way to involve Cross lest the rest of the nation 's crime fighters spend all their time eating doughnuts while ignoring tools like DNA and fingerprints.Will I read the next installment ? Yeah probably but only to find out how Gary Sonje will come back to outlive NannaMomma . ",2
"If you have n't yet read the Alex Cross books do what I did go back to the beginning . With the new movie coming out I thought I might check out the series from the beginning . I had watched the other movies but had never read the books . I could n't put it down . ",3
"I finally got around to reading the debut of the Alex Cross character in Along Comes A Spider and I really enjoyed it . Patterson makes a truely creepy villain who at times makes your skin crawl . A good hero is worthless without a good villain . The book dragged slightly in the middle but the beginning and end more than make up for it . ",3
"Just completed Along came a spider . This is my first James Patterson novel and boy what a novel this is . How many twists and turns you can keep in a novel . Every time I felt that Alex Cross has cracked the case the novel takes a new turn Gary Soneji character was scar for sure but the FBI agents who went for the ransom money was still more scarier . Ego Greed sex action everything is there in this novel.If you want to read an action packed novel that keeps you hooked to the book this one it is and I am doubly sure about this . ",4
"For some reason I stopped reading this series around book 9 or 10 . I 've continued to purchase them as they are released and my wife has read them all so I decided that the best thing to do was to start over from the beginning.This was actually the second Alex Cross and James Patterson book that I read . For some reason I read Kiss the Girls shortly after it 's release . I distinctly remembered that Along Came a Spider had a very different feel from Kiss the Girls and most of Patterson 's later works.Turns out I remembered correctly . Along Came a Spider still has a lot of the Patterson feel to it but it seems to move at a bit slower pace than his subsequent novels . Do n't get me wrong there is still plenty of action and lots of plot twists it just seems that Patterson let 's things take a little more time to develop.Overall I thought that it was a really good book . Patterson 's works will never be mistaken for highbrow literature but they are fun to read and you never quite know where he 's going to take you . This novel does a great job of introducing Alex Cross & Co. and the villain is one of his best . ",3
"Got ta GET it ! You have to get this book . It is the FIRST in the entire series . How can you not start at the start ? It is great ! ",4
"While reading the first alex cross book it is a page turner . Once over you are left with wanting more . ",4
"I found that James Patterson 's # 1 book Along Came a Spider is a very interesting read . It it not too often that I can find a psychological mystery to be this exceptional . The Gary SonejiMurphy out smarting the police with being a psychopath potential Multiple personality disorder personality fatigue and being the actor with having homicidal 1 year5 yearlifetime plans to be famous like he feels he should be is very interesting . From what I heard without reading any other Alex cross books this book will set up for some storylines in the next few books allowing for some interesting storylines for the book now.This book series is the Law and Order Criminal Intent series of James Patterson . While the story revolves around the crime and solving the crime there is a huge element to the psychological motives and the criminal intent . It involves the ticking of the criminal to why they would do the things they would do . It can range from money to famous to just being a pure psychological evil driven madman . All in all an A+.In this book by itself there is one drawback . It can be really slow sometimes . After Soneji 's trial and conviction about half way through starting with part 4 it starts dragging while Alex Cross continues the case . But it does lead up to a very interesting ending the last few chapters in which I will be willing to give it a pass.Like I said an A+ and an A+ book ! ! ! ",4
"being the 1st one of the Alex Cross series it sets the field for the following books although reading each one on it 's own and out of order will not be any problems because they each is a story unto itself . I am just making my way through the 3rd round of reading them in order over the last 7 or so years and it is still just as good as the last time . Highly recommended if you like James Patterson books . ",4
"I have never really found a mystery series or novel that I 've truly enjoyed every aspect of . That includes Along Came a Spider . Regardless this first book in the Alex Cross series was a perfect Sunday afternoon read switching points of view between the hero DoctorDetective Alex Cross and the villain . I would say the intricate plotline and psychological perspective more than made up for a somewhat boring at least initially romance but still had to take off one star for the ohsocliche wounded hero meets attractive romantic interest . ",3
"I have been putting off reading a Patterson novel for quite some time now . The movie version of this particular book had turned me off to it to be honest . However I made a grave mistake in assuming the story in the book would be as boring as the movie . There were hardly any similarities between the two . The writing of the book offered so much more than the movie does n't it always . There was wit insight action and emotions behind the characters . I think I will be continuing along down the Alex Cross trail . My hand will now proudly be raised as a Patterson fan . ",3
"Along Came A Spider is an okay installment to the Alex Cross series in my eyes . I think that it is overrated but I do think that it is okay for being the first.The writing is good and the characters are interesting . Patterson does a great job introducing the main character Alex Cross himself in a fitting way . But the best parts are when we see him with his family . And his kids are so adorable . Janelle and Damon make me want to see them more . Including Nana Mama who I just love seeing getting into arguments with Alex . Other characters like John Jezzie and Soneji I actually like . The mystery is done well too.But this novel has its problems . The romance between Alex and Jezzie feels a little forced despite that there is some development . The final twist at the end really makes me angry . I wo n't give anything major away but it deals with Jezzie and I really hate what Patterson did to her . I love Jezzie as a character . It did n't sit well with me . Even the time jumps feel out of place . They do n't go back and forth or anything they just skip a couple of weeks or months which made the pacing of the novel itself feel a little to slow . Soneji 's character did n't get the attention that I was hoping for in the end . In fact the ending itself felt a little to depressing.In the end despite its problems I might have with it this novel works out fine and it makes me excited for Alex 's next adventure . I say it is worth reading and buying . ",2
"Patterson has such style . Suspense and on the edge of your seat tension with Alex Cross is guaranteed in this novel . A great read with surprises of who is guilty at the end . ",4
"Pretty good book . I have heard much about James Patterson and wanted to try out a book . Excellent characters . The difference between Patterson and Deville is this Pattersons villians are extremely rotten people and evil to the core . Whereas Deville is far superior writer . I think the book would make a better movie I know there is one which is usually not the case ",3
"Along Came a Spider is probably the epitome of what every crimethriller novel should be . At 500 pages its easy to devour reading the suspense is well balanced but the real key to success is Alex Cross himself.Alex is a black detective with a degree in psychology who is passionate about his work volunteers at a food bank and counsels on the side.And he is n't perfect he loses his head and punches out racists does n't spend enough time at home with his kids and is a bit of a sucker for the ladies.The plot of the novel is pretty basic but flows well the first half reads like a standard serial killer case the pace does slow a little in the second half as deeper intrigue is revealed.As a psychology major I like Alex 's brief discussions about psyc although I find his use of hypnotism dubious but hey this was the early ninties not 2010The love scenes are a little clumsy particularly a steamy bath scene which kinda failed to interest.Most surprising was the ending I 'll try not to spoil anything where one of the crooks gets their punishment . I found it oddly touching and poignant.Gushing about Alex Cross aside highly recommended book ",4
"Read this book before but just as awesome rereading ! ",4
"This is a really great book ! It has suspence romance action and mystery . It is the perfect novel ! I would reccomend the book rather than the movie . Gary Soneji is teh perfect criminal and Alex Cross is the perfect detective ! If you get the chance to read this book GET IT NOW ! ",4
"I 'm a big Steven King fan . I have to say that James Patterson 's books have me hooked BIG time . I ca n't wait to finish one and get to the next one . Each of his books have managed to capture my interest from page one . Would I recommend it OH YEAH ",4
"Better than the movie ! More twists and turns and deeper plot ! Ca n't wait to move on and read the next one ! ",4
"This book is wonderful ! Suspenseful twisting and delicious James Patterson has crafted quite the protagonist in Detective Alex Cross . Fans of Jeffery Deaver and others like him with devour this one ! When Detective Alex Cross is removed from the murder of a poor black family to head the investigation of the kidnapping of two prominent white children he is less than thrilled . He can see injustice all around but is powerless to change the course of events to his liking . Making the best of a bad situation he throws himself into the investigation and quickly learns that things are not as they seem at all.Most of the book deals with the examination of the kidnappermurderer and that is easily the best part of the book . The villain is as twisted as they come and the uncertainty of whether he really is crazy or just acting is possibly the most chilling part of all . Even the romantic elements of the story are shadowy and twisted in this page turner . Do n't miss it ! ",4
"I read this book a few years back and recently saw the movie . I 'm such a fan of Patterson 's I wanted to include my review.In the first of the Alex Cross series this story is a race against time to find a kidnapped girl of a famous actress . Cross is called in to help and in only the way he can he finds his way to the end of this suspenseful ride . Not only will you enjoy the writing which propells the suspense and mystery but you 'll also enjoy the character development . It leaves you wanting more of Alex Cross one of my most favorite detectives of all time ! I definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading thrillers . I 'll warn you though like me after you read this book you 'll be off to the store or library to pick up many more books by James Patterson . ",4
"This was my first James Patterson book let alone my first in the Alex Cross series . I admit I was a little disappointed . I think that Cross himself is a terrible parent . He takes off and leaves his kids with his grandmother their greatgrandmother constantly so that he can have a tryst with his girlfriend seemingly without communication to the grandmother . the main antagonist is supposed to be so smart and prepared and we are to believe he got lazy and slipped up ? in a highprofile case that involves local P.D . the FBI and the Secret Service and every single one of them ignore a vital clues leads evidence and b an investigator close to the caseTruthfully I also was pretty sure halfway through that I had figured out the entire mystery . I did n't have it 100 % but it was close . This was n't a terrible book but given the buildup for Patterson 's Cross series and the overpriced nature of this book I certainly had higher expectations . ",2
"In Along Came a Spider James Patterson keeps you hooked from the first page.There are a few things a book needs to do for me if I 'm to call it great . 1 Hook me on the story . 2 Interest me in the characters . 3 Avoid too much predictibility . I believe Along Came a Spider is successful on all accounts.Most of the book is first person from the point of view of his main character Alex Cross . Interspersed throughout the book are chapters from a third person perspective . This style also makes the book go at a fast pace and makes it much more enjoyable . ",4
"The recipient of the book had just started reading James Patterson and really enjoys his writing and this book was no different . She finished it in short order and started on the next one . ",4
"I am very disappointed with this book . The story may have made a beautiful movie which I have never seen but it does not pass master as reading . The characters are cardboard cutouts from the standard psychopatic egomaniacal killer to the Alex Cross'es family . There is one yes I mean ONE plot twist that is more or less interesting the rest is so rote it is funny . The writer has no skills whatsoever in building tension . He also can not put together an interesting description . I will not even touch the dialog with a ten foot pole . And why on Earth do viewpoints have to shift all the time ? We do n't learn anything interesting when they do . ",1
"I was n't as thrilled with this book it drug out the story for so long I loved it at the start and then it went down hill till the end ",2
"I ca n't believe I waited so long to start reading this series . I 've read all of the Women 's Murder Club series and loved all of those books and this was a great beginning to the Alex Cross series . I ca n't wait to read the next one . I just hope that James Patterson is really writing this whole series himself like he says he is . ",4
"I blazed through the last 180 pages of this novel . It was awesome . The action kept up even when the chapters changed . I thought that with the short chapters which depicted a scene change would make the book herkyjerky but that was far from the truth . What did end up happening is the action was swift and gigantic in its brashness . I am currently on Kiss The Girls which I wo n't speak of here but when I 'm done I will give my take on it . ",3
"I love this book ! It had me engaged from the beginning . I would definitely recommend this book to another reader . ",4
"This is a competent thriller I stayed up to learn more even when I should have turned my lamp off and gone to sleep . I particularly commend Patterson for his ability to write believably from the point of view of someone from a different race . It sounded realistic to me however I 'm not AfricanAmerican & I 'd like to know how it sounds to someone who is.Patterson succeeds in creating life on the page . The writing quality is not consistent . Cliches redundancies and irrelevant descriptions disappointed me at times.I 'll try to avoid writing a Spoiler Review but a very illogical event was that someone who did n't murder receives the death penalty . ",2
"My mom loves author and loved this book . This is a great selection for a book lover and especially a lover of James Patterson ",4
"Whenever I meet someone who says I do n't like to read or Books are boring or my favorite I 'll just see the movie . I tell them to read Along Came a Spider . I have two copies and I ca n't tell you how many people I have loaned them to over the years and had them returned to me with a different attitude and questions like Is this a series ? and Can I borrow the next book ? The short chapters and fastpaced action make this book easy to read and impossible to put down.This is the first book in the long Alex Cross series . It is the story of a booksmart and streetsmart cop from Southeast DC named Alex Cross who finds himself investigating a series of high profile serial kidnappingmurder cases . Along with his partner and bestfriend John Sampson . Cross and Sampson will stop at nothing to bring wrongdoers to justice.If this is your first taste of James Paterson do yourself a favor and order the next book Kiss the Girls when you order Along Came a Spider one book wo n't be enough . ",4
"I enjoyed this book from the beginning to the end ! He keeps you thinking ! You may THINK already have the murderkidnapping solved when he adds another monkey wrench to the story ! It 's like a never ending story you do n't want to end ! ",4
"I WATCHED THE MOVIE AND DECIDED TO GIVE THE BOOK A TRY . DEFINITELY LOVE IT WAS SO FAR . SUSPENSFUL . THE DELIVERY WAS QUICK AND THE ORDER PROCESS WAS EASY ",4
"James Patterson did it again . He creates the sickest villian with many twist and turns . Is Gary SonejiMurpy has a split personality or a psycopath ? ",3
"This book was very exciting from beginning to end is a great read for anyone who loves Alex Cross.watch the movie several times but the book is nothing like the movie . So much better . ",4
"I bought every book in this series because after I read the first one I just waned more ! James Patterson does not disappoint . There is a reason he is such a best selling author ! ! ! Each book is better than the last one and you not only fall in love with the main charachter but with his whole family and profession alike . This series is a murder mystery cop drama kind of series and is definitly at the top of it 's genre . It is not for the younger audience or the very tender hearted as it has graphic literary imagery . It puts you in the mind set of TV shows like Rizoli and Isles Law and Order CSI and Major Crimes in the sense of type of series and graphic crimes but its focus on one detective his cases his life and his family makes it a more personal look at the crime and solving of it . You wo n't be able to stop at one book and you wo n't want to put it down when you start ! ",4
"The very best . And seeing the movie made it even better . A good start in a seriesVerna Mae Newman ",4
"I had never really had the chance to be a James Patterson fan because I have only read Kiss The Girls but now I am one of his biggest fans ! I received my order for Along Came A Spider yesterday and I have already finished the book ! It was unbelieveable ! I ahd a hard time putting it down ! Alex Cross again has solved the perfect crime and suffered in the process but it never compromises the ending and we are never disappointed ! ! If you like suspenseplotsand whodunnit then this is the book for you . You wo n't be disappointed ! ! ! ",4
"Patterson does it again edge of your seat suspence . Has that twist that you never see coming as usual . Wow ! ! ! ! ! ! ",4
"Unfortunately I saw off reading book seven I this series so I 'm going back now . But in definitely hooked and plan to read all twentyone . James Patterson is a genius . ",4
"Very captivating with a lot of surprising twists and turns . Loved it . Could not put it down from beginning to end . ",4
"not for me . ",1
"It is hard to read Patterson without one of his most famous works thank you ! Great book speed and value ! ",4
"Never a dull moment it will keep you guessing . But because of the violent content and subject matter this is a mature audience only read . ",4
"Once again a nice story starring Alex Cross . His marvelous style and heroics make this a good read . The villan or villans change as the story moves on . His remarkable relationship with his family and partner shine through as usual . Not many lulls in this story made for an overall good book . I look forward to the others I have n't read yet . ",2
"I just finished reading Along Came A Spider by James Patterson . This book is targeted for the thrillersuspense genre . it takes place in Washington D.C.This book is about two kids from two wealthy families who get kidnapped by a man who poses as their teacher . The whole novel is about a whole team of people who are working hard to find the kids . Patterson switches points of view every few chapters so that the reader can see the story unravel from other perspectives not just the main character's.I personally loved the book . I feel that the author kept enough details hidden to the point that the reader would be mind blown when they were revealed . Many people do n't really like the writing style that James Patterson uses in his books but I personally do . I have to admit I have read many other James Patterson books and I have loved them all . The only problem I have with this particular book is where he talks about how one of the character 's wives died . In other books in this series I am ashamed to admit that I read this series out of order before discovering my mistake he gives a different account on how she died . ",4
"Here is where this book changed things for meit tells you who the bad guy is in the beginningand you think or atleast I did great now there is no guessing gamesno fun but believe me this book gets addicting from page one . Guessing Games Thrills Action and everything else it takes to make a great bookI gave Patterson a chance to either make me say yea it was alrightnothing special or its amazing i have to read more of the serieswell obviously its the second one . I recommend to start here and keep going with the seriesreading out of order would be way to confusing at times . Patterson really has a talent and shows it with this book . ",4
"I enjoyed the action and plotdriven pace of Patterson 's Along Came a Spider but was disappointed in the one glaring hole in the courtroom drama . If the prosecutors could simply point out that Gary Murphy knowlingly disguised himself on a daily basis to be Mr. Chips then they could have shown that Soneji was not a schizophrenic . Being a nice schoolteacher took enormous effort on the part of either Murphy or Soneji thus premeditation for crime was apparent at this stage . Teachers at Washington Day describe Murphy as likable it could n't have been Murphy ever teaching school . Murphy would have wondered what the hell he was doing in a classroom in DC in a wig . He never did . Therefore the whole ploy was impossible from the getgo . Luckily Patterson was able to distract us with burning crosses and other subthemes so that we readers would gloss over the weakness of any schizophrenia defense . At least we can take comfort in the wise decision of the jury for they saw through the weak defense argument . ",2
"I have a brother who is really interestedin crime fiction and he has spoken highly of this series so I read the books not in order however . this is where you should start.the murderer is an intersting villain but it is the characterization of Cross his hrandmother and his best friend John Sampson that maid this book compelling and led me to read the rest of the series even though it shows the signs of a beginner in being overwritten at times despite the short chapters ",2
"This is an eerie bookthe disconnect between normal facade and perverted hidden reality is a major theme in Patterson 's Cross series . Effective disguises and roleplaying over long periods of time plus the ability to wait for years to execute a crime plan is what makes Gary MurphySoneji so frightening.I had read Kiss the Girls earlier with no background on Alex Cross . Reread it and found that what I remembered were the characters Kate and Scootchie . I had totally forgotten who did the crimesin Kiss the Girls this is revealed at the very endwe 're surprised but also disappointed since we do n't know this guy as a human being at all only as Casanova . Casanova and the Gentleman Caller are not portrayed with anything like the depth of Patterson 's Gary character.Also Patterson handles the surprise ending much better in Spider . Jezzie 's name should tip us off Jezebel ? as well as the fact that her relationship with Alex is just too too magazinestory perfect . But the gradual revelation of what happened to Maggie Rose as well as how and why is well done and seeing her reunited with her mother is very satisfying.I enjoy Alex and his family his midnight porch pianoplaying etc . as well as Man Mountain Sampson Nana Mama and the kids . At the end of Kiss the Girls it is clear that Soneji will be coming around again shades of The Poet by Michael Connelly . Yeah it 's different to know who the criminal is early onmaddening to watch him dance awaybut hey that 's what being hooked on this stuff is all about ! ",3
"When he saw the previews for the movie Along Came a Spider my brother encouraged me to read the book before the movie came out . I was pleased with the results.The only reason I gave my review 4 stars and not 5 is because when you get to the end the rest of the book seems rather drab . I found Alex Cross to be a very intense and deep character . Gary Soneji also was a very deep and at times even confusing character.Like I said the ending ROCKS ! I seriously read the last 150 pages in a blur I do n't think I even took a bathroom break . The begining was a typical forensicpsycopath book but not nearly as good as books like Silence of the Lambs . I was like I thought James Patterson was suposed to be a brilliant author ! . Then I hit the end and it just blew me away ! Some people say they did n't like the ending I loved it ! It caught me off guard and was as far from cliche as you can get . Thats what I love in a book.I seriously reccomend this book . It may start slow but by the end you 'll be trying to catch your breath ! ",3
"This is simply a very entertaining book . It has a great story line that is both suspensfull and surprising . Paterson gets into his character Alex Cross like no other . Writing story line and characters all develop well and come together smoothly . Cool Beans ! ",3
"hard scifi with a great story as a framework . another good novel of the xeelee sequence . ",4
"Flux was my first foray into hard scifi and it was not what I expected . I had tried to read a few others in the genre but was turned off by the textbooklike narratives and lifeless characters but Baxter does a great job of combining the science behind the lives he has created within a solar body with the humanity of a race of intelligent beings clinging to the layers of their world . I can honestly say that I was captivated by this story and enjoyed it thoroughly . ",3
"This is the second Baxter book I 've read after VACUUM DIAGRAMS and like the first it 's a mix of brilliance and disappointment.Baxter unquestionably has the wildest hardphysics imagination in the business . The world depicted in FLUX is a staggering conceptual achievement taking the amazing concept of neutronstar life first suggested by Frank Drake and developed by Robert L. Forward in DRAGON 'S EGG & amp STARQUAKE and going one step further creating an ecosystem within the neutronsuperfluid mantle of the star and exploring its whole geography from crust to core . The biology locomotion and senses of the inhabitants are well worked out.But Baxter 's imagination tends to outrace even him . In both his books I 've read there have been major flaws in logic points on which he failed to think his ideas through . Here for story convenience he asserts that the nuclearsize humanoids ' life and thought processes happen at normal human speed . Readers of Forward will see the absurdity of this . The nucleonic processes on which this life is based are a million times faster than chemistry because the particles are so much closer together . Even if it were possible to slow these people 's life cycles so much in proportion to the underlying processes they 'd be agonizingly slower than the native organisms around them living on a slower timescale than even the plants . There are other moments of shortsightedness sometimes he describes them in humanlike ways incompatible with the anatomy and physics he 's defined . How could Dura have slick palms when they do n't perspire ? When the reason for these microhumans ' creation is finally revealed it does n't make sense . It would 've been more logical to build mindless robots for the task and ones betterdesigned to fit the environment . The creators ' choice to make them almost exactly human down to the same impractical anatomy and the same emotions and aspirations shows a sentimentalism fiercely incompatible with the project 's goals.Baxter also gets confused about the scale of his trademark structure Bolder 's Ring . In VACUUM DIAGRAMS he said it was millions of lightyears across yet described an attack on its rim affecting its center instantaneously and described a distant observer seeing the battle across its whole width in real time . And here he describes it appearing tiny from a distance of mere thousands of lightyears . Baxter seems to have trouble realizing the physical and temporal scope of his own creations . His imagination is bigger than his judgment.Baxter 's a far better writer than Forward but as in Forward 's books the plot is basically an excuse for illustrating the environment and physics . His characters have a modicum of emotion and personality unlike Forward 's but are sometimes superficially drawn and hard to get a handle on . The one sexual interlude is painfully awkward and gratuitous from a character standpoint serving only to illustrate the mechanics of the act for this species . And let 's not go into Baxter 's seeming obsession with bodily functions . He could 've chosen a more pleasant term for biological jetpropulsion.Amid the superlatively exotic setting the society is relentlessly ordinary and unimaginative . The sociological storyline replays the mythology of countless British WWII films and American films about Britain such as MRS. MINIVER a stratified society is torn apart by disaster and becomes united promising to rebuild as an egalitarian utopia . It 's tacked on quite awkwardly here . Overall Baxter pulls the reader in two different directions in the environment and physics he strives for unimagined wonders but for the people and society he pulls against that and forces them to be as mundane and familiar as possible.FLUX portrays the most extraordinarily alien yet credibly developed physical environment I have ever seen in SF . But this just throws the book 's flaws and its ordinary storytelling into sharp relief . And Baxter 's failure to think through all the ramifications of his own ideas and the huge logic gaffes that result are a continual frustration . ",2
"The most striking thing about this novel is the setting . The events take place within a thin layer just below the surface of a neutron star.Somehow life is possible within this environment and the main characters are a tiny race of beings created by humans to be able to live in the environment.Within this world the author creates a preindustrial society whose attitudes bear an odd resemblance to those on the planet Norfolk in Peter Hamilton 's Night 's Dawn series . Yes despite the setting the characters are really taken from pastoral England . Indeed Baxter 's heroine Dura and several of the other characters might have walked out of a novel by Thomas Hardy.The novel follows the adventures of Dura as she starts out trying to save her small clan and ends trying to save the world and perhaps even the universe itself.A good story some interesting characters and a great setting . So what could go wrong with that ? Well despite all of this promise the novel finally failed to be complete because of the way that the ending was handled . Suddenly new technologies situations and relationnships were introduced to tie up all of the dangling threads and bring things to a conclusion . I almost had the feeling the the author suddenly decided that it was time to get it all wrapped up and off to the publishers . ",2
"Stephen Baxter is practically the hardest of Hard SF writers around . ` Flux ' is another volume in his sprawling Xeelee Sequence of novels and short stories . The Xeelee Sequence does n't have to be read in any particular order as the stories told span a timeline of tens of billions of years . Readers can dip in and out of the novels and collected short stories at any point. ` Flux ' tells the story of Dura one of a microscopic species of human who live in the mantle of a star . Hers is a feudal society with strict stratification of the different classes . Verbal history tells of a once more technological society now lost after the Core Wars . Sounds preposterous I know but Baxter 's greatest strength is that despite the heavy duty science in his works he never loses sight of the human element . His story of Dura an upfluxer and her adventures in Parz City and beyond is so engaging that the reader can forget that the technicalities of the story and enjoy the adventure.Through a series of good bad and dumb luck Dura finds herself at the center of an expedition that is the only hope of saving the Human Beings in her particular star . Through her tribes legends of the Xeelee she is able to engineer a meeting with a Colonist a denizen of the core of the star a downloaded copy of the original humans to seed the star with Dura 's people and formulate a plan that will save all the species of humanity from destruction . And consequently reengineer a fairer and more just way of life.It 's hard to find Science Fiction these days that actually has some science in it . Baxter is at the forefront of the rebirth of Hard SF . Do yourself a favor and read one of his books . I guarantee you it wo n't be the last . ",3
"I greatly enjoy the novels of Michael Dobbs . I have read several and plan to read more . Tp play the King and The Final Cut were wonderful . ",4
"very interesting..Michael Dobbs is terrific . Ifyou have not tried his Churchill serirs I recommend them as well ",4
"Having been a huge fan of the PBS House of Cards trilogy on cable television VHS then DVD since its first airing I decided I had to own the DVD trilogy for myself . Then I really got interested in author Michael Dobbs and wanted to see for myself how the original written word translated into the screen versions I 've enjoyed so much . I was not disappointed . Though the book and the screenplay different in detail but what adaptation does n't I truly enjoyed reading the Dobbs original . This is brilliant writing ! ",4
"The third and best installment of the trilogy . The writing is a little laboured by the plot rattles along . The plot line and developmetn is a lot tighter than the previous two books . The despicable PM is finally seen as the creature of his own making manipulative irredeemable and subject to his own success . Overall a good light read into fictional British politics that does n't tax the readers intellect or political knoweldge too heavily ",3
"This is the final book in the Francis Urquhart trilogy . Urquhart is up to his usual evil doing ways and the finish is wonderfully appropriate . If you enjoy political intrigue murder and a truly loathsome character you will greatly enjoy this final instalment by Dobbs.I highly recommend the entire trilogy . ",4
"This book is next in Plaidy 's Queen 's of England series if you were reading in historical order behind Lady in the Tower.I first read of Catherine Howard in Phillipa Gregory 's The Boleyn Inheritence which was a good book also . But I prefer Plaidy 's Catherine over Gregory 's any day.First I 'll say that Plaidy shows Catherine as a product of her environment a girl who never really had a chance . She was sweetnatured loving forgiving and just happy . This may have caused her to act foolishly but Plaidy made her foolishness more organic than Gregory ever did . Catherine in this book was more unlucky to me than just plain stupid . I do n't think it 's really fair to call her stupid when she was never really taught.In contrast to Gregory 's Catherine Plaidy shows her from her earliest childhood years to the very end . I felt that Plaidy made her a bit more fleshed out more real human instead of an airheaded bimbo with nothing to care about but clothing and jewelry . Plaidy almost made Catherine Howard seem intelligent.Catherine here is seen to pay even some attention to her surroundings . Unfortunately when she tries to join in on a conversation she is told to remain silent and treated like she 's nothing more than a chair in a room . I felt that she was treated like a child the entire way through the book until she became Queen of England.I also felt that Plaidy made Henry more likable here . He 's shown to be a sweet older man until he becomes angry but with Catherine he 's like a grandfather with sweets . Because Catherine is n't so concerned with politics this book shows a softer side of Henry missing in other books I 've read about him.Unfortuantely Catherine 's past comes back to haunt her in a way no one thought it would . It ends with her death and the death of two of the men who truly loved her . I also felt that Plaidy showed Henry 's huge disappointment with his choice rather well.I 'd highly recommend this book if you want to know more about Catherine Howard and her affect on the aging King Henry . ",4
"Katherine Howard the young and pretty fifth wife of Henry VIII and cousin to Anne Boleyn is the subject of one of Plaidy 's last novels written in the style of The Lady in the Tower.Katherine through the aid of a scribe she was not greatly educated tells her life story . Born into an impoverished branch of the great Howard family she is sent to live with her grandmother the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk and it is not long before her good looks and bad company begin to get her into trouble . When she is given a place as a lady to Anne of Cleves her family attempts to use Henry VIII 's infatuation with her to serve their own interests.The Rose Without a Thorn is a very moving and intelligent historical read . Readers see how the young foolish Katherine goes from the Queen of England to a prisoner when her past comes back to haunt her and she is also charged with adultery . Most likely to add more validity to the love story with Culpepper there is a small historical inaccuracy at the endKatherine did not actually say that she would rather die the wife of Thomas Culpepper than as a queen.However a wonderful page turner . I was actually moved to tears at the end . ",4
"This novel of Katherine Howard the fifth of Henry VIII 's six wives was a very enjoyable and clarifying historical read . To begin with let 's agree that Katherine was never given a fair chance in comparison to the King 's other wives . Katherine was not as extravagant wellknown or amazingly beautiful as some of the more renowned ones were . She was extremely young to be a bride a child in fact . So this in itself puts her in a category of her own.The author brilliantly exposes this fact by writing in the first person so that we are never to forget the fact that she was merely a child . Reading it from this point of view makes the history so much more understandable . It is difficult to be judgmental towards Katherine in any way when you read the story through her perspective.Katherine Howard 's life is pretty simple up until she moves into the Royal Court where she is ultimately setup for her demise . The events in her life unfold like a cruel domino effect led by the deceptions and scheming of others leading Katherine to her tragic end . Her innocence kindness curiosity and acts without malice rendered her character simply endearing . Plaidy captures the essence of this ChildBelle enraptured in a world of delusion schemes and intrigues . The game was too quick and too fierce for her to endure . Inevitably this young girl 's innocent and hopeful nature could never survive in the vulturous world of Henry VIII.The Rose Without a Thorn is a quick read that moves you from one scene to the next in smooth and inviting transition . The passages are moving and although I often felt exasperated by some of Katherine 's decisions and motives I felt I understood this character precisely because of her circumstances . The build up to the tragedy is difficult and ultimately heartbreaking . Excellent read . ",4
"I previously read the Boleyn Inheritance by Philippa Gregory and in comparing the two versions of Katherine I have to say that I wish I had read this book first . I believe Jean Plaidy honored Katherine Howard whereas Phillipa Gregory made her out to be a spoiled brat.Jean Plaidy dove deep into Katherine 's upbringing and now I understand why she was so naive and sweet . Katherine expected everyone to be like her kind and sweet sympathetic of others . But in Henry VIII 's era who really was ? This book also describes Henry VIII as the miserable 'fat ' man that he was but Katherine felt so sweetly towards him because he made her feel loved and wanted something she always needed . And she was not ashamed to give it back something which Henry VIII yearned for utterly like a little boy . In a way I think Henry and Katherine Howard were a perfect match both children deep inside.I loved this book . It was a fast and easy read that had me captivated from page onebut then again every Jean Plaidy book I have read has done the same . She does not disappoint ! ",4
"I love Jean Plaidy I 've never made any secret of that fact and I found that she does a fabulous job of articulating what I 've always thought about Katherine Howard Henri VIII 's ill fated fifth wife . The writing is as masterful as always and even if you 're familiar with the tale of Katherine Howard I think you 'll find yourself wrapped up in this book . The story starts out with Katherine talking to her friend the scribe and it is all presented as the story she is telling to the scribe in the days leading up to her death.Katherine is portrayed as a mostly thoughtless girl who lives entirely for the present which is totally how I 've always thought of her . Time and time again she says something along the lines of why did n't I think about what this would mean for the future ? And also mentions how she should have thought more about how her actions were so in line with what had sent her cousin Anne Boleyn to the scaffold . At one point Katherine even says that while she believed her cousin to be innocent she knew she herself was not.Although this story is not a new one to me it was presented in a new way in that Katherine knew her actions were dangerous and she gave in to them heedless of the consequences . She was almost noble at times wanting to protect Thomas Culpepper as much as she could and refraining from saying anything that would implicate him in any way . With that in mind it 's very sad to me that she did what she could to protect him but did n't seem to be trying to protect Francis Derehem in any way . I mean what if she had told them that there was a precontract ? Would it have saved all their lives ? I loved that Plaidy shows Katherine 's regrets even though some of them may be misplaced and in her way she even tries to make up for her past indiscretions . What is extra interesting to me is that if Katherine lived in today 's society she would have been a pretty normal girl . She just had the misfortune of being born in the wrong time and catching the eye of the wrong man . ",2
"Interesting but very shallow . Characters were very 2 dimensional and there was no real detail . Still it hit the high points and was a fairly pleasant way to spend a lazy afternoon . ",2
"I really enjoyed this work . It was fun to read about one of Henry VIII 's less known wives . However as this was my first Plaidy work I was taken aback at how vain and shallow Katherine was portrayed.Throughout the book I wondered if my dissatisfaction with the main character of Katherine was because of the writing or because of the character herself . When I reached the end and reviewed the Book Group notes I was relieved to see that this was definitely the author 's intention as Katherine was referred to as a bimbo . This was further validated by a little Internet research too . Plaidy deftly captures the period with its scars and intrigues.Not one to start a Plaidy collection with but a very good read . ",3
"Great author great story . Anyone who enjoys historical novels will enjoy this writer . She keeps to the facts as much as possible . Great way to learn about English aristocratic . ",4
"I read this book immediately following Philippa Gregory 's The Boleyn Inheritance which made sense seeing as they both cover the same characters . You can see my review of Gregory 's book here . I liked reading them back to back in order to get a more wellrounded view of the character of Katherine Howard.Plaidy 's Katherine is looking back on her life retelling all of the events that have led up to her present state of confinement . You even get some little side notes like if I had only known or I would have done that differently . It 's refreshing to see someone of that time period recognizing their faults but I 'm not sure that in reality Katherine actually realized what was happening . Plaidy makes Katherine likeable naive and comes of age very quickly at a time when one needed to fully understand the world around them . I actually enjoyed Katherine in this novel where as in some other books she is whiny overly sexual and just unlikable.This was my first Plaidy read and it definitely made me a Plaidy follower . Her characters feel very real and there are so many little details about the world around them that you do n't get sometimes in other books . A wonderful read . ",3
"I 'm just getting into the study of Katherine Howard . I am of the impression that this depiction is most accurate but I will read more books to see if I can get a better idea of who Katherine may have been.AnywayI know that this is a factfiction mix I have to say Good GODwhat a dingbat she wasas portrayed in the book ! The Duchess slapped her at one point.The Duke slapped her and appeared to want to throttle her a few more timeshellhalfway through the book I wanted to slap her ! Several times in the book she was likened to a child and here 's where I fault the Duke and Duchess to an extentWhy in the world would you place a youngminded woman at the HELM of such a devious plot ? She would be her own and everyone else 's undoing . I can not imagine that they were all that shocked when the poop hit the fan . Her uncle the Duke probably just gave a deep sigh and shook his headAnd it hardly matters if Katherine had no knowledge that she 'd be a queen . Her 'betters ' knew . Because Katherine was being prepared for 'something ' though that 'something ' remained to be seen for a time . Or what else was the point in moving to the Duchess ' home or establishing a position at Court ? The Duchess at least should have been keeping an eye on the young lady.I suppose the lure of the Crown was too much thoughI 'm guessing.Still to put Katherine in Henry 's sights was a grave mistake . Because it was Katherine.She had other redeeming qualities . She was kindhearted & goodnatured . She seems to have been sweet and lovingbut she seems to have been something of a simple girl . Entirely unsuited to the environment she was thrust into the unscrupulous and craftier personalities around her or the 'games ' that she was forced to play.The Duke came to her in an attempt to warn her that supplying the King 's enemies wclothes could be taken badly . Rather than taking heedshe engaged him.Thomas Culpepper came to warn her about taking certain ppl who were knowledgeable of past into her household . That she was Queen and needed to understand the politics of the situation . That there were other political factions at work . Using herand working against her.She responded with surprise and confusionand ended up sleeping with Culpepper that same night ! SMHShe had relations affairs and flirtations with Derham Manox and Culpepper . All 3 and especially Culpepper should n't have EVER managed to get that close to her . Yet she places them in her household ? and Lady Rochford ? Why have such a woman in your personal space ? She has the blood of Anne & George Boleyn on her hands with her false testimonies.I read another account that implied that Katherine was somewhat blackmailed into appointing other witnesses to her Court . She was a womanbut goodness she was still a Queen . She still had influenceand only a few ppl knew the truth about her.These witnesses and participants could have either been persuaded or threatened into silence.The objective would be to nip it in the bud BEFORE the gossip has a chance to 'grow legs'.Also the Katherine as depicted in this book could have made better use of the Duke.Now he may not have had been the most decent person out there . He was selfserving and uncaring . A horrid man by some accounts . Certainly was n't likeable.I doubt he would risk his head for her BUThe was ambitious and everything he did was done for the sake of the 'Family'.So of course he would look out for Katherine 's best interests . He had to . His and Katherine 's goodfortune were intertwined . Looking out for Katherine was looking out for himself.He had inside knowledge and was no novice when it comes to court affairs.A person like this is useful as an advisor.But you do n't just cast someone like this aside.Katherine seems to have isolated HERSELF and chose to place vipers in her midst . I ca n't fathom someone in her position making these kinds of mistakes.But ppl like her do exist . They are too wayyy 'gentle ' for world . Too trusting and lighthearted . They do n't have the sense to act in their own best interests.It 's sad.Anne Boleyn may have been too smart for her own goodbut at least she had a sense of selfpreservation and common sense . ",3
"Jean Plaidy 's dozens of novels written in the third person are among the very best historical fiction to be found but these firstperson novels in her Queens of England series that she wrote toward the end of her life really are pathetic.And in this case out of date . Plaidy 's other novel about Katherine HowardMurder Most Royal The Story of Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard was published in 1949 more than a decade before the publication of Lacey Baldwin Smith 's groundbreaking study of KatherineA Tudor tragedy The life and times of Catherine Howard . Murder Most Royal therefore rehashed through no fault on the author 's part subsequently discredited theories e.g . that Katherine and Thomas Culpeper were first cousins according to Smith 's researches they were only sixth cousins that they were childhood sweethearts and that Katherine in her scaffold speech said I die a queen but I would rather die the wife of Thomas Culpeper . One might think that someone who wrote so many historical novels and whose bibliographies are littered with history books would have stumbled across A Tudor Tragedy by 1993 when The Rose Without a Thorn was published incidentally the same year that Plaidy died.Apparently not . Smith 's study is not listed in the bibliography . Neither are the books about Henry VIII 's six wives by Alison Weir and Antonia Fraser published in 1991 and 1992 . And so The Rose Without a Thorn rehashes all those old stories about Katherine Howard that had been discredited thirty years earlier . Plaidy has Katherine giving the scaffold speech I die a Queen but I would rather die the wife of Thomas Culpeper . Katherine and Culpeper are portrayed as close cousins . Katherine is portrayed as being about eighteen years old when she went to Court when according to modern research she may have been as young as fifteen and as going to Court after Anne of Cleves was already queen instead of arriving there in time to be a maid of honour when Anne arrived . Katherine is also portrayed as saying at the time of her arrest and interrogation I knew little of the ways of the world . I believed myself betrothed to Francis Derham and that that meant we could behave as husband and wife when as Smith shows Katherine vehemently denied that she had ever been betrothed to her former lover Francis Dereham even though admitting to such a precontract could potentially have saved her life by denying it the councillors dug deeper and found out about her much more serious dealings with Thomas Culpeper after her marriage leading to her being attainted for treason and executed . And bizarrely the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk is portrayed as being Katherine 's actual grandmother rather than her stepgrandmother her late grandfather 's second wife even though Plaidy got this correct in Murder Most Royal.The Rose Without a Thorn is not a complete travesty of historical fiction technically the writing are storytelling are competent . But they 're both superficial and of course the content is out of date . If you 've read a fair amount about Henry VIII 's six wives and are looking for an accurate depiction of events then it 's probably best not to bother with this book since its mistakes and discredited theories will irritate you . If wonderful storytelling is all you 're after then it would be better to read Murder Most Royal . ",1
"Katherine was a young girl very lovely in the manner of Ann Boleyn she is also her cousin whose strength was also her downfall . She appealed to Henry VIII who just has divorced Ann of Cleves because she was everything that Ann was not . Fair pleasing and not very clever . She is used as a pawn by her uncle Duke of Suffolk to get back the power from the Seymours who have the King 's favour . She goes along with it with some misgivings because of her past which is chequered to say the least . I felt that she probably made Henry most happy of all his wives . When the dark clouds of Katherins 's unsavoury past start clouding over there is a place where you think that both Henry and Katherine are pawns of the men around them for if they had met he surely would have forgiven and taken her back . It leaves you wondering about Henry VIII about the follies of youth which some commit and grow beyond A very absorbing tale if a little sad ",3
"In this the final novel in her Queens of England series of books the author weaves a tapestry of political intrigue romance and historical detail into the story of young Katherine Howard the fifth wife of Henry VIII . A masterful storyteller the author who also writes under the name Victoria Holt and has a cavalcade of devoted readers creates a work of historical fiction that will transport the reader to another time.The book details the rise and fall of Katherine Howard a young impoverished noblewoman of an illustrous family . As a young girl she was sent to live with her grandmother the Duchess of Norfolk where she unfortunately fell in with a licentious group of retainers and became ensnared in two unsuitable affairs of the heart . Little did she know that they would serve to haunt her a way she could never have imagined.An opportunity orchestrated by her Machiavellian and ambitious uncle the Duke of Norfolk arises for the beautiful though foolish Katherine to go to the Royal Court as Lady InWaiting to the fourth wife of Henry VIII the kindly Anne of Cleves . Katherine obligingly goes . There she falls in love with her cousin Thomas Culpepper a gentleman of the King 's Bed Chamber . Her hopes of marriage to her handsome cousin are soon dashed however when she catches the wandering eye of the King who loathes his current wife.Having charmed the King and having little say in the matter Katherine becomes his fifth wife once he divorces Anne of Cleves . Katherine 's initial happiness as Queen is cut short however when her lurid past comes to light and is brought to the King 's attention . This coupled with her indiscretions with Thomas Culpepper are enough to abruptly terminate her brief reign over England as its Queen and cause a number of heads including hers to roll.This is an intriguing blend of fact and fiction which is laced with enough historical detail to satisfy those readers who enjoy historical fiction . It is with good reason that the author has a legion of devoted readers . ",3
"I just finished The Rose witout a thorn the story of Catherine Howard . It 's a great look at her life while in her grandmother the duchess 's household until her end on the scaffold . She is presumed innocent but was not so innocent at times . She took advantage of King Henry seeing her as his rose without a thorn and made numerous mistakes in the process . She was young and immature about alot of things and that got her into trouble . Befriending Jane Boleyn was also a bad move . But for a lonely girl with no friends she had no other choice . She was used as a pawn by members of her family like her cousin Anne Boleyn before her . And she was always compared to her by the duchess . She never felt loved or good enough by any of her family until she won the love of a king . She then enjoyed the respect they had to show her as their queen . It 's a must read . Everything Jean Plaidy writes is exellent . ",4
"I went through a phase where I just read the heck out of everything Tudor historical fiction and biographies alike . Jean Plaidy 's books are easy to read interesting historical fiction accounts of these famous people . ",3
"I read quite a few of the books by Jean Plaidy in the Queen 's of England series when I was younger . They 're hard to come by since they are out of print . I decided to collect the rest still missing one and catch up on my royal reading . I 'm hoping my feelings for this book have more to do with the fact that I 've read a better one about Katherine Howard than I may no longer like the writing style . It started out fine although I was a little disgusted by the way Katherine was allowed to behave when she moves to her grandmother 's house . I would think a Duchess of the court would have better sense of what was going on in her household . But history seems to have proven otherwise . I also felt that the author made Katherine seem much more simple than she really was . But maybe her families ambitions were just way outside of her knowledge . The book also lacked the terror that must have been going through the young queen 's mind towards the end of her life . What a tragic ending for a young women who had almost no hope from the start . I would recommend reading The Queen 's Mistake by Diane Haeger over this one . ",2
"Jean Plaidy is by far my favorite historical fiction author . She has a style that is both infomative and addicting . She is able to put a familiar face on a woman that lived so long ago and make you feel like you know her on a personal level . The Rose Without a Thorn is a 260 page novel that 's written from the perspective of Katharine Howard Henry VIII 's fifth wife and his second to lose her head.Katharine was raised in the household of her grandmother the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk . She was taken into the households of Horsham and Lambeth at 10 years old because he parents were too poor to give her a proper upbringing . She was enchanted by her music tutor Henry Manox and had a fairly innocent love affair with him . Katharine meets Francis Dereham soon after casting off Henry Manox . She starts her relationship with him at age 15 right after the death of Jane Seymour who was Henry VIII 's third wife . Francis Dereham and Katharine swear to marry each other . They are soon discovered by her grandmother and he is banished and leaves for Ireland . She receives a place at court with Anne of Cleves at age 18 . Dereham returns not long after and she dismisses him and their relationship as child 's play . There is talk of betrothal between her and her cousin Thomas Culpepper . When she enters court she befriends Jane Rochford who is still something of a paraiah after the execution of her husband and sisterinlaw . She catches the eye of the king when she is forced to sing at a banquet . Henry has his marriage to Anne of Cleves annulled and makes Katharine his new wife . After becoming queen Katharine is blackmailed by one of her grandmother 's former ladies Joan Bulmer . Joan threatens to tell of Katharine 's indiscretions when she was at her grandmother 's unless she gets a place as a lady in waiting . Soon after Joan joins Katharine 's household Henry Manox returns and is given a place with the court musicians . Dereham then returns and is appointed Katharine 's secretary . The king leaves on a campaign to restore peace in the northern territories and while he is gone Katharine starts up her affair with Thomas Culpepper who is she totally in love with with the help of Jane Rochford . Katharine is charged with treason for her early affairs and lying about them to the king . Three ladies from her grandmother 's house all testified against her Joan Bulmer Kathryn Tylney and Mary Lassels . Dereham and Culpepper are executed for their affairs with Katharine . Before her execution she asked to have the block brought to her so she could practice and the next morning lost her head for being a wanton woman . Too many lover too much to hide . ",4
"I loved this book and immediately wanted to read more of the authors work . Wonderfully told story that makes you feel like you 're there ",4
"I have read much that has been written about King Henry 's wives . This novel gave so much more personal in depth information . Seeing it all through Katherine 's eyes was spellbinding . ",4
"I recently bought this book along with Lady in the Tower the other new Plaidy rerelease . This shorter volume tells of Katharine Howard the cousin of Anne Boleyn who also became queen of England and who also shared a similiar fate . Katharine is born into an impoverished branch of the Howard family a very noble English family that is also very stable at court . When her powerful Grandmother comes to visit their meager country estate Katharine intrigues her Grandmother and is whisked off to live at her Grandmother 's large and beautiful estate . While there her Grandmother neglects her and Katharine gives into the daring acts of the girls who work in the estate who share her bechamber . Katharine befriends her music teacher Mannox and invites him into her bed at night . The affair ends fast and one Francis Weston comes into Katharine 's life . However this ends once Katharine 's Grandmother comes upon Francis and Katharine frolicking upon a parlor floor . Around this time Anne Boleyn is crowned queen and so the entire entourage and family moves to the Lambeth estate on the Thames River in London . Now Katharine falls for her own cousin Thomas Culpepper . However Katharine 's powerful uncle has plans for his neice and finds her a place in Anne of Cleves shortlived entourage Anne Boleyn has hence forth been executed and Jane Seymour has died . Henry VIII begins to notice Katharine and after demissing his marriage to Anne of Cleves he courts Katharine and soon she is thrust onto the same stage her older cousin came upon a decade or so before . Katharine is wedded to the king in a short ceremony and soon begins her short reign as Queen of England . However when rumors of her past affairs come back Katharine finds herself in danger . Franics Weston comes to court as does Mannox bringing back haunting memories that could cost Katharine her head . But when Katharine commits adultery with Thomas Culpepper one night her fate is sealed . Henry in his first happy marriage in decades is brought the horrible news by those insanely jealous of Katharine 's new fame and the Howard 's rising fortune even though they were already very dominant and had more power than the Tudors . Katharine is guilty as are her lovers and all are brought to the block or the gallows . And even on the scafold Katharine declared I die a queen but I would rather die the wife of Thomas Culpepper . I loved this book and found it highly enjoyable . I find it no wonder that Jean Plaidy is acclaimed a sone of the greatest historical fiction writers ever . A haunting and compelling story full of intrigue and unexpected twists and turns Katharine 's story was a short lived one that is often overshadowed by her cousin 's story but is just as interesting .

"As I read this book in the wake of rereading The Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley I was thoroughly in the mood for more Celtic tales of Druids rituals and magic . This story does not conjur up half the magic of Bradley 's masterpiece but it does satisfactorily probe some of that primordial mystery that shrouds the ancient world and its people . In this tale unhappy adolescent Adam spends most of his time on the hillside where the Celtic stone from another century proudly stands . Little does he know but the stone is a gateway to another time a time where Druid Priestessintraining Brid is able to pass from her time the 6th century into the far futureAdam 's time in the 20th century . At first he views the vivacious Brid as a marvelous playmate but when she initiates him into the pleasures of sexual love he is smittenat least for while . As Adam matures he leaves his home village and sad childhood to pursue his dream of becoming a doctor . His life moves onto other women marriage and children of his own . However Brid does not move on she is still the young and beautiful Druidess who defies her family and her religious traditions to pursue Alan across the boundaries of time . Her obsession is allencompassing she lets nothing stop her from getting back into Alan 's life and to control him in the only way she canin his bed . Brid 's melancholy and frustration is uniquely portrayed by Erskineindeed it permeates the tone of the entire story.Ms Erskine is surely the master of the obsessive tale the reader while finding Brid somewhat annoying after plaguing Alain for over 50 years can understand her bewilderment over aging Alan 's puzzling behavior when defending his frazzled family from her and commiserate with both their mutual attraction for one another and Alan 's disgust with himself as he falls prey over and over again to Brid 's charms . After three generarions of daunting pursuit and umpteen pages it is to the reader 's great relief that with the help of a powerful present day druid and Alan 's grandchild Brid 's claim on Alan can finally be loosened and Brid 's own immortal soul released from her uncle 's grasp.Although I enjoyed this book and found it hard to put down I must say I enjoyed Erskine 's earlier works much more . In particular House of Shadows certainly pricked those tiny hairs off the back of my neck ! Even so On the Edge of Darkness succeeds in eliciting sometimes frightfraught emotions for both protagonistseven if these emotions are a bit disturbingwhich stay with the reader after the book has been closed and put down .

"Like all her novels this one is captivating . I like her style and what she writes about . Certainly recommendable for lovers of mystery and ancient times ! ",4
"Fleeing his harsh Presbyterian father 's home in the Scottish highlands a young boy Adam has a passionate affair with a mysterious bypsy girl Brid . She 's far from ordinary as Adam discovers when she draws him towards the sixth century and the magical Druidic word from which she really comes . Years pass Adam leaves Scotland and marries never bargaining for the strength of Brid 's determination as she returns to exact her violent revenge.I loved the aspect of period of the Druidic world and how the story takes places in different time periods . ",4
"Having found this book in Scotland last fall I excitedly purchased it and set aside only recently getting a chance to read it . This is classic Erskine and a welcome return after her last two books which seemed to be written for the American market rather than from the heart . All the classic Erskine elements are here a Celtic theme wonderful paranormal elements and a mystery to be solved . Ms Erskine will not disappoint with this latest offering . This one is sure to join the ranks of KINGDOM OF SHADOWS and LADY OF HAY in providing the reader with a fullbodied read of such depth and mystery that even the most cynical historical reader wo n't be able to put it down . Glad to see a return to what she does best classic paranormal fiction ",3
"In her list of books Barbara Erskine has mastered the art of using an item a place or a person as a catalyst for a journey between the present time and the past . In this title a Celtic stone cross in the Scottish highlands is the portal through which fourteen year old Adam meets Brid a girl from sixth century who is training as a Druid priestess . But just as Adam can enter the sixth century Brid can enter the 20th and there a 50 year nightmare begins for Adam and his loved ones.This is quite different from Barbara Erskine 's other books which basically follow the theme of a fairly normal modern day person finding themselves transported to another time . Here a dark entity comes into this time . 'On the Edge of Darkness ' explores some rather disturbing emotional problems . Adam 's father is such a complete religious fanatic he drives away his wife and his son lives a sad lonely and emotionally battered life . Brid forms such an obsessive attachment to Adam that her jealousy knows no bounds . The emotional void in which this leaves Adam 's wife is dreadful.If you are a fan of stories of the past and present colliding which I certainly am you could do a lot worse than reading this book . On the way you will get to explore some dark areas of the human pysche areas I would rather read about than live through . ",3
"This is a well written compelling story of a love that intersects the past as well as the present . An excellent piece of paranormal fiction it keeps the reader riveted to the pages.The story begins in the nineteen thirties when a fourteen year old boy named Adam while traipsing in the isolated crags of the Scottish highlands near an ancient Celtic stone meets a girl named Brid whom he mistakes for a gypsy due to her wild long hair and her exotic style of dress . Unbeknownst to him a portal in time has opened allowing Adam and Brid who is actually a Druid from the sixth century to cross back and forth in time . Adam however does not realize that he is actually travelling back and forth in time while Brid is not only fully aware of what is happening but is doing so in contravention of what her uncle a high priest to the Druids and her training have taught her.Over time she becomes obsessive about Adam who is her first love while Adam as he grows up moves on with his life . In leaving the heartsick Brid behind and consigning her to his memories he takes his life in a seemingly new direction.Brid on the other hand forsaking the teachings of her people and incurring the wrath of her powerful uncle and a sure sentence of death is dead serious about Adam and she goes through the time portal in search of him . Adam who has by now left home to go to medical school is unaware of her obsession and of the lifelong quest now set in motion.Over the years Adam makes new friends becomes a doctor gets married and has a family but Brid trapped in the wrong time begins to haunt them all as she searches for Adam . Her obsession with him finally turns deadly and the body count begins as she seeks to tear him asunder from all whom he holds dear.It is only fifty years into the nightmare that this obsessive love is finally put to rest . How this happens and at what cost will keep the reader turning the pages of this well written and imaginative novel . ",3
"It grieves me to say this book is nothing special . The plot sounded amazing to me when I first read it on the website but once I started reading it I discovered that it was poorly explained and executed.Adam meets a young girl one day who he becomes friends with even though she lives in an odd gypsy village in the Scottish hills while he is the son of a minister . They soon become lovers but Adam moves on to be a doctor and when Brid fearing for her life because her uncle the druid wants to kill her is rejected by Adam she swears to become the main focus in his life . Of course it turns out Brid is really from the 6th century and has great powers that allow her to cross time.The way Brid became accommodated to life in the 20th century is just stupid . No person from the 6th century who saw a car would be able to hold it together much less eat chocolate without a huge sense of wonder.Brid 's situation as a person who can travel through time change into a cat leave her body at will and do all sorts of other stuff is never portrayed as anything out of the ordinary and as much as she does make Adam 's life miserable the actions people around Adam take to be safe from her are just plain silly . Also it 's never clear if Brid really is in the 20th century or just having an out of time out of body experience from the 6th century . Or both . Not much in this book makes sense and the very end of the book is so out of place in the book it renders the whole ending stupid.This is not one of Barbara Erskine 's better books and I recommend skipping this one . It has the feel of a draft written very early on that was never revised for anything except spelling . This book does n't even seem to fit a category be it historical fiction or thriller . If you want a real good historical book about time travel try the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon or Doomsday Book by Connie Willis.I hate to say it but this only gets two stars from me . ",1
"It begins well and is intriguing but then loses its depth . I did not care about any of the characters because there was no depth to them either . Adam is completely unlikeable and Erskine never really goes into detail the relationship of all the characters enough in order for me to care about them . The ending of this book was also lousy . ",1
"The delivry was fast . The book was fantastic like all of this author 's work . I will buy more in future . ",4
"I 'm somewhat dubious about the steady stream of gushing about this book from a few years ago . Suspicions of shilling aside I think this is vintage Sheldonenjoyable middlebrow escapist trashy fun . MadeforTV of course . While it 's certainly not deserving of best book ever ! or whatnot I think anyone looking for a realistic plot is also missing the point . It 's sheer fantasy with just enough humanization of the characters to make one suspend disbelief . Sheldon 's protagonist seldom varies from book to bookbeautiful hot woman who outsmartstriumphs overexcels in the man 's world around her but Tracey is one of the more likeable versions . Smart with heart . Shrewd but not ruthless only robs the guilty etc . Actually had a mother she loved a refreshing change from Sheldon 's usual Electracomplexriddenwhere'smydaddy heroine.Okay in one instance the illogic of the plot did get to me . When the fake FBI agents leave her on the train and disappear it 's a bit preposterous that she could just head for the airport and find them . Even 20 years ago I doubt that you could just randomly find two people at a busy airport . How could she have known what terminal or what flight gate they were at ? For the most part it 's got clever fantasy capers and provides a minitour book description of various hotels and restaurants in Europe . ",2
"Book is divided into two parts.In the first part Tracy Whitney protagonist is a bank employee . Her mother is tricked by few gangsters and ripped of property . Tracy tries to avenge her mother but she is also framed and send to jail by gangster . She faces several hardships in the jail and forms accomplices . On releasing from the jail Tracy and her accomplices avenge the gangsters.In the second part Tracy could not find a job because of her past and with time she turns into a art thief . She steals expensive paintings and diamonds under strong security . Thefts are challenging and detailed in the book . Tracy outsmarts her rivals and police around the globe.I like the second part of the book because it is interesting and I was kept curious of what was coming ahead.Overall this book is a good read and I recommend this book .

"I read this book years ago and really loved it ! I wanted a copy for myself so I could read it again and found it on Amazon . Sidney Sheldon always writes such big powerful characters and sometimes his stories get too political for me but this one does not . In my opinion it 's definitely the best book that Sheldon has ever written ! ",4
"But I have to say I like this author a lot as well . I have never read a bad Sidney Sheldon book . ",4
"IF TOMORROW COMES is one of the best books I have read in a long time and I read a lot.Bravo to Sidney Sheldon . Sorry that he has passed on but his tales are still with us . ",4
"I have always been a fan of Mr Sheldon and have read and reread nearly all his books . This book started off extremely well and held me spellbound and thrilled a real pageturner . And then it sort of went . well just past being entirely credible . But that being said he does spin a good yarn and for sheer escapism it is well worth the read . ",2
"I read this book twenty years ago and still remember how great it was . I remember because it was one of only two books I had to sneak a peek ahead . I do n't want to give any spoilers so I 'll just saywhat this means is that the characters were so real to meI just had to know . I could n't wait until the end.And although I ca n't say that my books are similar to any novels Sidney Sheldon was my first love and the writer who made me want to write . I truly believe that he was the father of romanticsuspense novels especially those portraying a female heroine.Carmen DeSousa author of romanticsuspense bestsellerShe Belongs To Me ",4
"Her world falls apart and she loses everything . But this is one smart woman and she plans a perfect revenge . ",4

"This is the first book that I read by Sidney Sheldon and I was completely in awe of the scope of this story . Every twist in the plot had me turning pages late into the night simply because I was unable to put the book down . I was quite simply riveted to the spot . The main character Tracy is someone that you come to care about and respect as she leads you a series of wild and unexpected adventures . Sheldon has created an intelligent witty and captivating tale that will keep your jaw on the floor for days to come . ",4

No longer the victim she comes to enjoy the thrill of the scam and goes off on an amazing life of crime . This story is an adventure so go along for the ride . ",3

"AMUSINGFASTPACEDAN ENERGETIC ESCAPIST ROMP.New York Times Book Review3.5 stars . After finishing this book I glanced at the cover and reread the minireview posted there see above and I could n't agree more . In many ways this is typical Sidney Sheldon the main character is a beautiful heroine caught up in amazing situations filled with adventure and exotic locales love and lust power and privilege fame and riches waiting to be experienced . But as this book stands it was a little too typical . The writing is standard massmarket mediocrity loaded with tons of dialogue to keep the pace flowing like quicksilver and the scenarios are often so predictable as to be anticlimactic . The structure of the story is a bit odd however as the very beginning feels like a novella that ends abruptly midway through the book . What follows are a series of capers that could have been sectioned off as shortstories if not for the recurring main characters . If you are new to Sidney Sheldon I most heartily recommend Master of the Game over any of his other works . The Sands of Time is also worth checking out . If Tomorrow Comes is enjoyable for what it is a quick entertaining read . ",2
"Love this book . Have for many years . I could n't find it used anywhere and I prefer to buy mine used for budget and Eco friendly reasons . ",4
"I gave this book five stars . it was one of Sidney Sheldon Best books.I wish he was still with us to write more of his super good books . ",4
"I had as much fun reading this novel as any I have ever read . All I have to say is I think a lot more Sidney Sheldon is in my immediate future . ",3
"The first part of the book acts as the setup for the second . The first is slow and the description of how the protagonist takes revenge from her enemies is frankly naive . The second part is better but still if it 's supposed to be a thriller it would have to be addressed for earlyteeners not for adults . ",1
"Sidney Sheldon is an excellent author . I have read all of his books . A fantastic author was lost went he died.If you like romance and suspense you will love his books ",4
"Very good suspence and well written . Could n't put it down and almost hated to get to the end very good . ",4
"I have read just about every book Sheldon has written . I love his style of writing . Sheldon always makes the female character excel . He has such exciting plots and adventures . This particular story really made my day . You ca n't put it down . He makes the impossible seem possible . If you love this one than try to read his other books you will be equally entertained . ",4
"If Tomorrow Comes was my first encounter with Sidney Sheldon and I would have to say it was good . I did n't know what to expect from the book after only reading it on a recommendation but was glad that I took the advice.The book moves quickly and at fast pace . I found myself expecting the story to go one way and then surprised along the way.I also thoroughly enjoyed the various 'cons ' and 'schemes ' that were told in the story . Makes me wish I was as creative.I give it 4 stars . ",3
"Great book . Was listed as used but appeared brand new . Would consider buying from this seller again . ",4

By the end of the book she is a master criminal and con artist able to outsmart any mark police officer or investigator no matter how dedicated to stopping her they are.The first few chapters of this book were a little hard to get through with rough language and vulgarity but once I got through those few chapters I could not put this book down . I just could n't get enough of Miss Tracy Whitney and her adventures . ",3

Tracy Whitney is a very clever and smart character . I really wish that I had all of that cleverness that she had ! I loved the way that she outsmarted everyone even Daniel Cooper . ",4

"This was the first Sidney Sheldon book that I ever read . Years later after reading them all it remains my favorite . I loved this book so much that I 've read it about 10 times . The characters are terrific and it 's fun suspenseful and powerful all at once . This is a great read and I recommend it highly . Everyone I 've recommended it to so far has loved it ! ",4
"This is an excellent story the first part of the book when tracy goes to jail and when she get out and takes revenge for her mother the second part is a little bit repetitive with her robs because one and another and another were almost the same except the last one that was an amazing one . ",3
"I know I must have read this book years past but had forgotten the story . I downloaded a sample when I was reviewing Sidney Sheldon 's books . It is absoultely one of the best mysteries in the history of time . Sidney Sheldon completely keeps you guessing as to where he is going with his plots and who the characters of the stories really are . I recommend that you read this book but also let me recommend that you read every book he has written as they just continuously get better and better . This man was a genuius in his own rights when it came to writing . I read mysteries all the time but his are by far at the top and exceed any and all expectations for a wonderful and entertaining book ! Just read it ! ! ! ! ",4
"I love Sidney Sheldon and this book did not disappointment me . It is do nice reading on the kindle at work . ",4
"The beginning book was what I expected after reading the descriptionbut then the middle and the end went on a whole new angle granted I liked itbut it was sort of odd . Was an 'ok ' read . I reread books all the time but I would n't reread this . ",2
"Tracy Whitney the heroine of this novel is like all of Sidney Sheldon 's leading ladies She 's young beautiful bright and driven . Oh she 's also a professional criminal . The story opens as Tracy is wrongly convicted of attempted murder well OK she DID shoot him ! and begins serving a harrowing prison term . After her surprising release she plots revenge on all the people who have hurt her . This was my favorite part of the book . Tracy then becomes involved with a conman and ends up as a worldfamous thief stealing treasures in the capitals of Europe . She also finds love with another thief but can she trust him ? If you can overlook Tracy 's criminal life and the joy she takes in it you 'll love this book . It describes in minute detail how she manages to steal from the most securelyguarded museums stores and homes in Europe . There is humor too as Tracy and her pal Jeff merrily bounce from caper to caper outsmarting the authorities and narrowly escaping capture . Another great Sidney Sheldon pageturner ! Kona ",4
"I have read this book several years ago . The brilliance is the flow of the plot . It is a page turner . ",4
"I enjoyed this book so much . There was so much going on.Tracy s revenge was brilliant . LOved this book start to finish ! ",4
"Sheldon tried to create a plot consisting of a string of unrelated scams pulled by his heroine Tracy White succeeding in all of them certainly this is very difficult to believe by a serious reader . The main character and heroine Tracy White working for a man named Gunther becomes a modern Robin Hood ripping off cardboard characters of unsavory reputations with no logical reason at all just for the sake of doing . The so called story goes superbly fast and the scores of situations popping up get solved in a couple of pages one after another with an abuse of twist and turns but there is no plot after all . I have rated it two stars one goes for the poor quality and another goes for the fun the story sometimes carries on particularly in the beginning . If this is your first time with Sidney Sheldon try other Sheldon novels i.e Master of the Game . ",1
"Wonderful book but I was absolutely stunned at the ending . Where is the ending ? There surely is a sequel I hope ",4
"From the beginning to end you will be find yourself wrapped up in the world of the main character Tracey Whitney . It is full of surprises adventures and definitely some mindblowing experiences . You will be fascinated by her jealous of her sympathetic to her and you will love her ! You can learn alot from this book . It is a mustread ! ",4
"A woman is framed for a crime she did n't commit and left to rot in prison with no hope for release . She is abused and forced to act tough and learn the ways of the criminal to survive . She is able to engineer her escape and get back at those who wronged her . Having been soiled of character revenge on those who wronged her is not enough . She then proceeds to become a super highclass con artist . The book goes on to tell one sting after another . An interesting one involves conning to chess masters into thinking she if playing each where in fact they are playing against each other.The woman decides to do one last score and then retire . This will turn out to be a real tough thing to accomplish.I have read about 10 Sheldon books and this is by far my favorite . It raises the question does a person 's environment determine whether they will become a criminal or does the genes ? Sheldon goes for the former in this book . ",4
"I did n't read Sydney Sheldon in my teens in the nineties when all around me were devouring them . I just stuck my nose up at that popular culture . It was only last year 2013 that I decided to see what all the fuss had been about . Master of the Game was alright in the way you 'd expect a popular paperback to be . But this one If Tomorrow Comes was utter nonsense and ridiculousin fact down right irritating . I do not recommend this book to anyone with an IQ rating of above 1.5 ",0
"It 's been more than 20 years since I read this book by Sidney Sheldon and it is still the best book I 've ever read . In fact Sidney Sheldon in my humble opinion is the best author that I 've come across . He truly was a master storyteller . I 've read this book several times over the years and it still leaves me breathless . I must say part of the appeal to the story is the main character Tracy Whitney . She is a heroine that defies the odds and comes out on top in the end . It is a book that you simply ca n't put down . ",4
"I read this book in 1985 I bought it Hardcover To this day I still remenber the title and the plot . Started readind at app.730 pm and read all night .I keep saying to my self I will finish this chapter and then go to bed.well the first thing I new it was 630 am and i had read the whole book COULD ! T put it down.To this day 12 years later I still recommend this book to friends . ",4
"In If Tomorrow Comes Sidney Sheldon keeps you turning the pages from the first to the last . When the book ended I wanted to read more . A great journey of a read with awesome characters and many wonderful story lines . This is the 2nd Sidney Sheldon book I have read along with Rage Of Angels and it certainly wo n't be my last . I plan to read all of his books . You will not be disappointed . Happy Reading ! ",4
"this story begins as Sheldon 's usual suspense books but later turns into wuiet a unique book in comparision to his others..the heroin in the book is loveable..and every page is filled with fun and unpredictabelityu will probably be APPLAUDING by the end of this book..YEAH its THAT GOOD ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! JOYYYYYY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ",4
"This was one of the most exciting books I have ever read . It is the story of a woman named Tracy Whitney . She gets framed for a crime and is harshly punished . Afterword she gets released from prison for doing a good deed for a warden and after getting even with those who turned against her she begins to become highly wealthy from pulling off one con after another.While the cons may seem to get tedious they put you on the edge of your seat . Just when you think Tracy is going to get her due she amazingly escapes again . This novel is nearly flawless . The only think I did n't like was that she was going to get revenge on her exfiance but she seems to just forget about it . But it 's okay . Do n't miss this novel . ",4
"This was really good book and the ending was n't as predictable.I highly encourage you to read it . I will definitely be purchasing more Sidney Sheldon books . ",4
"ALL OF THE SIDNEY 'S BEST WORKS WERE READ BY US FRIENDS WHEN WE WERE IN COLLEGE THAT IS ABOUT 1012 YEARS AGO HIS LATER BOOKS LACKED THE AURA WHICH HIS EARLIER BOOKS HELD.AGAIN THIS IS A MAGNIFICIENRT BOOK.WHAT IS THE BEST PART ABOUT SIDNEY 'S BOOKS IS THAT HE LITERALLY TRANSPORTS YOU IN THE BOOK YOU FEEL AS IF YOU ARE THE MAIN CHARACTER AND THINGS ARE MOVING AROUND YOU . A FEAT NOT MANY CAN ACCOMPLISH ",4
"A thrill ride of bad luck stupidity good luck and more serendipity . Great fun especially the part with the painter it 's near the end but a little on the un side of believable . ",3
"Another winner for Sidney Sheldon . His books always keep you engaged and wanting for more . This storyline is what movies are made of . ",3

"I am in the middle of this book right now and I have to say that it is a very good book very suspenseful and keeps you on your toes . A really genuine Sidney Sheldon book . I am enjoying it and recommend it . ",3
"You just want to find out what happens next . The description leaps off the page and suddenly you find yourself propelled into the world of Tracey Whitney a world of near escapes perfect timing intrigue passion and last but not least the hope for tomorrow . A brilliant creation and work of fiction . A plot that really stands out amongst the rest . ",4
"What a fantastic book ! One of Sydney Sheldon 's best without a doubt . This was a real page turner and is one of those terrific books that really lets you escape from the real world . His characters come alive and you are completely drawn into their world . You wo n't be disappointed ! ! ",4
"If you want to read a book with non stop adventure and excitement with a uplifting story this is the book for you . ",4
"This good was good yet it lackedthe who done it part I love all of Sidney Sheldon 's books so far I 've read 10 so far and this one was justI just did n't get excited about it . And I read what other people think about this book and I just think to myself WHY HOW can someone say something that good about this book ? My favourite Sheldon book is The Doomsday Conspiracy which was my first and it made me want to read them all If I read this one first I would n't read any of his others . Giving this 3 stars is pushing it I only gave it that much because it 's Sidney Sheldon Maybe it 's because I 'm 15 that made it not appeal to me a great deal . I do n't particularly care for reading books with lesbian activity in them But the beginning was interesting the end wasalright the middle had nothing . ",2
"I have n't read anything from Sidney Sheldon that I did n't like and this story definitely goes to the top of my outstanding reads list . Tracy Whitney is a young trusting honest and very smart young lady . Seems her life could n't get much better she has a great job in the bank working as their computer expert and a wonderful fianc & eacute Charles from a good solid and welltodo family in addition to a baby on the way . Through a series of unfortunate circumstances her life is forced into a tailspin and changes literally overnight . Tracy uncovers the truth behind her mother 's suicide which begins a series of disastrous events in her life . The one person she thought she could count on abandons her and she is on her own to avenge the evil powers that led to her mother 's death . Tracy attempts to take the high road to bring about justice however sometimes the high road has too many bumps and other methods must be sought . Tracy discovers a workable skill to avenge the people that have crippled her life for their own profit . At the same time this same skill lends a hand in persuading the rich and affluent to share their wealth with others less fortunate even though the methods are not necessarily voluntary ! You ca n't help but want to applaud our heroine for her enduring efforts . Does Tracy beat the odds and come out on top ? What becomes of our heroine is Sheldon 's story to tell and mine to recommend you read . ",4
"I loved this book ! ! On the edge of my seat from page one very descriptive I could feel every place she went and I couldnt put it down . I didnt think the Title was all that fitting for the entire book it made sense for the first 13 of the book then from there it needed another title lol . Anyway it was so good that I went all the way back to re read the Other side of midnight . And all I can say is that Sidney Sheldon is one hellofa writer keeps you guessing and takes you to some nice places as you journey through his story . ",4
"If you 've not read Sidney Sheldon this is a great place to start ~ This is my favorite of all his work ! I love the heroine she starts off one way living a lovely wonderful life ~ about to marry the man of her dreams when her whole world is quite literally shattered.Every horrific thing that happens to her changes her tempers her but never breaks her.Sidney Sheldon was the first writer I ever read where the heroine did n't wait for the hero to come and rescue her and this is my type of girl . I do n't want one who lays on the railroad track screaming for help give me the girl who 's rolling her way to the sharp rocks saws her ropes free and outsmarts the villain.I ca n't recommend this book high enough ! ! ! Just an FYI ~ This book was written in 1985 and is dated ~ there is no way with today 's technologies that the situations would be plausible . So keep that in mind when you decide to purchase andor read ~ It 's still a fabulous fun read . ",4
"I enjoyed this book but felt it a little long winded . Plot and story line could have been told withmore flair and less drag . ",2
"As an avid reader of more than 3000 books I can say without reservation this is the best book I 've read bar none ! ! ! ! The story line is simply brilliant ! ! ! A woman beset by misfortune and poor choices lands herself in not only serious trouble but in jail and manages to claw climb and scrape her way out of it all and rise to the top of her game . And how she stays at the top kept me spell bound . This is a must read . ",4
"Read this book years ago when it was first published and loved it . Decided to experience it again and it is still just as riveting . Great writers can always stand the test of time . ",4
"This was my 1st Sheldon read..i was impressed..many good twists to the story in a book that was not easy to put down..id refer it to anyone who likes a thriller ",4
"Abridged Version is WAY too short . Leaves so much out you really can not follow the series . Better to read the book The book is excellent but stay away from any abridged version . ",1
"Summary'Executive Orders ' opens with Jack Ryan the hero of numerous Clancy novels having suddenly found himself President of the United States as the result of a terrorist attack that killed most of Congress and the President that appointed Ryan as his vicepresident.He is immediately launched into several crises as a terrorist organization sponsored by the Iranian government brings the ebola virus to the U.S. introducing an outbreak . At the same time the Iranian government who is in cahoots with India China and Japan is also taking over Iraq after having assassinated the leader . The world is on the cusp of major problems and the leader of the most powerful nation arriving there without having been elected has to answer the call . But what 's more the former vicepresident who resigned because of a sex scandal now claims that he should technically be the vicepresident.Jack Ryan holds up under the pressure but in order to bring the U.S. under control he has to enact martial law closing down numerous major cities to prevent the spread of ebola . He also sends John Clark and some other members of Rainbow Six into Iran to assassinate the person running the show . When everything comes to a close ebola is contained the quasihostile takeover of Iraq is stopped and everything returns to normal.My CommentsThe book was n't too bad but I really did n't see why the takeover of Iraq by Iran was such a big deal . Sure international politics are sensitive and tricky but considering the stability of the Iranian government as opposed to the Iraqi government I ca n't see how it 's so bad that the government fell maybe I 'm naive I do n't claim expertise on international politics.There is also a lack of focus on Jack Ryan as most of these later books have done . Ryan disappears from the foreground into the mix of characters and does n't really appear to be the primary focus of the novel . The novel also jumps around from character to character introducing one for just a scene or a chapter then never really returning to them.Most of these problems may be addressed in the actual novel which is quite lengthy . But the abridged CD version which is the one I listened to just does n't give this story the depth that it really needs . As is the case with most of these later novels which I happened to listen to one right after another but in the reverse order the CD versions were just not as welldeveloped as a good novel should be . You 'll have to look for a different review on the actual novel but I definitely would n't recommend the CD version it just does n't give a very good version of the story . ",1
"Jack Ryan becomes President of the United States in this Clancy novel and must face the daunting tasks of restoring the nation 's government managing a health crisis and win a war . I thought this book was excellent even on a level with The Cardinal of the Kremlin . Although long this book has many very interesting stories that all come together for a very nice ending . Worth reading if you are a fan of Clancy or if you are not read it anyway . ",4
"This is Clancy 's greatest novel yet . No spoilers here.In my reviews I highlight the best and the worst of a novel short and sweet.2 Best parts of the book1 . The way he explores Jack Ryan as a flawed man who could only be thrust into the Presidency and would never have become president in a typical way.2 . The obstacles present in being president with little or no support system . Clancy shows the flaws in the career politician mentality that has become Washington . It is easy to forget how the founding fathers came to be President as working men and after they were President they returned to their jobs or did other government jobs.2 Worst parts of the book1 . Unlike some of Clancy 's novels this could have been longer ! He could have expanded some parts of the story line instead they just fizzled out.2 . I am not really sure I could not put this book down.The action of this book the detail and the conflicting situation makes this book hard to put down . The story is BEST read in order book order not published order . There are a lot of subtle storylines that are connected to previous books and make this book more enjoyable ! ",4
"Oy ! I started my Clancy reading with October and ca n't remember all the ones I 've read at this point . The last one I read was Cardinal and it was really spectacular . THIS ONE ? Not so much . Pretty much what others have said . It 's REALLY long . There 's lots of plot elements that just do n't belong . And the right wing political preaching just does n't fit with the genre . Sure..lots of Clancy 's plot scenarios are just so far fetched that the sheer impossibility is fun to contemplate and I think that for me that 's what keeps me turning the pages . I would disagree with some of the negative reviews about the battle scenes at the end of the book . Sure.there 's lots of jingoism in here but the general battle strategery that he goes through was interesting to me.You can watch Clancy interviews with people like Charlie Rose on the internet and it does n't take long to see that this is one weird fella . He is a smug knowitall and I think he really does n't know what he claims and this particular book seems to be the culmination of his personality bleeding over into the story to it 's the story that is detriment . At least I did n't pay for it..I traded a couple of other paperbacks in . ",1
"Clancy 's quality shot downhill man . This is where his books moved from entertaining engaging reads throughout to technoporn and drivel . Red October Clear and Present Danger Patriot Games and Without Remorse are his best ones and the reasons are simple . They also provide a clear contrast with this book.1 The best particularly Patriot Games and Without Remorse are character and plotdriven . When characters develop you can see it happen and understand the reasoning . They also do n't solely fulfill stereotypesarchetypes like the godless moralless mercenary terrorist . This loses that completely aside from Ryan and Ryan alone and he 's been developed plenty in the preceding books . I do n't care about archetypal Indian Prime Ministers who are solely politicians and offer nothing interesting . I do n't care about the aforementioned terrorist who is never even named . If a character arises that I do find interesting IE Badrayn I expect them to stay in the plot or at least have some resolution not disappear halfway through when they should be central to the plot.2 They 're not technoporn . Part of Clancy 's appeal has always been his realism of course . The battle towards the end of this book is about a full 100 pages too long . Running through the minutiae of a largescale tank battle without providing background on most of the commanders ? Boring . Sum of All Fears is the worst about this but only in an isolated section the technoporn pervades this entire book and makes it quite hard to read even for an engineering grad student.3 They 're not preachy . The morality of the characters fine help explain their motivations . Discuss the problems associated with treating drug lords as criminals vs terrorists vs enemies of the state . This is where Clancy decided that he knows the solution to every political problem and his views are the only ones that make sense . Ok rebuilding the government from scratch essentially is an interesting topic does n't mean I care at all that Clancy wants a flat tax . Red Rabbit is easily the worst in terms of this but this book is where it started . Political drivel spouted from the characters fits political drivel spouted from the narrator does n't . You pick nononsense types to head your agencies and they push for new ideas that does n't mean theirs are the only ideas that make sense unlike what is put forth here.4 The subplots are meaningful and tied together . The books are n't padded out at least the good ones with ridiculous plots that do absolutely nothing for the story . The subplot in this book about the Mountain Men serves no purpose whatsoever besides lengthening the story . They never meet up with any other characters there 's no evidence that any other pivotal characters ever learn they exist and their plan amounts to nothing in the middle of nowhere . I ca n't believe the editor let this garbage stay in the story . Solely padding the story out.You can see the problems I have with this book . There are some interesting ideas though the reaction of world leaders to an untested new president who has never been scrutinized is intriguing . The political aspects are also . There are way way too many flaws here to overcome them though . Clancy used to be able to spin a good yarn Without Remorse is an excellent story and an excellent book . This is neither . Avoid this book if you have n't yet read it and I ca n't say I recommend any of his later works . Stop before Debt of Honor even . ",1
"While I harbour suspicons that the villain of former Vice President Edward J. Kealty maybe a slanderous representation of the late and great Senator Ted Kennedy this is still a great novel . Clancy 's works are very realistic and I thoroughly enjoyed it . ",4
"In the horrific climax of Debt of Honor former intelligence official and National Security Advisor and briefly VicePresident Jack Ryan finds himself elevated to the Presidencyand in the sights of foreign and domestic adversaries . Even as the Capitol building smolders and the late President Roger Durling is laid to rest unfriendly eyes are watching the new and untried President Ryan for signs of weaknessand begin plotting his and America 's downfall.In Iran Ayatollah Mahmoud Haji Daryaei one of the opponents of the Fowler Peace Plan in The Sum of All Fears broods in his office and begins to set in motion a series of crises that will tie up America 's already overextended military and intelligence services . Daryaei enlists not only his own operatives in Iran and abroad but also the leaders of two other nations with global ambitions of their own . By creating a series of seemingly unrelated crises all at once including an Iranian merger with Iraq and renewed tensions between the People 's Republic of China and Taiwan Daryaei hopes to distract American attention and pave the way for a savage attack on both President Ryan and millions of American citizens.But Ryan has made many enemies at home too including the former VicePresident Edward Kealty who had been forced to resign in the wake of a personal scandal . With the skills and connections he has made during his many years in Washington Kealty begins a campaign to remove the stilluntried Ryan from the Presidency.Clancy 's huge novel is both compelling and complex taking the reader from the ruins of the Capitol to the jungles of Africa and into the crowded streets of Tehran as President Ryan begins the awesome task of rebuilding a government decimated by a terrible act of revengeand facing a loose confederacy of enemies bent on destroying his country his family and his life . ",4
"Just the thought of starting with a whole new congress is a nice thought . But by resignationsnot the way it happened in the book . Have n't finished itinteresting to see the conclusion ",3
"Probably one of Clancy 's best.He builds the numerous plot strands nicely all leading to an explosive ending.My only complaints and they are is the same complaints I have with every single one of his books..1 he stereotypes his character 's conversations ie if the character is an unlisted man he abbreviates everything and uses slang if he is a senior officer he does n't that type of thing.2 there are too many unnecessary passages about what the characters are thinking yes we need to know what their thoghts are but not ad nauseum.But all in all an excellent book . ",4
"This is a good edition of the Ryan Series . It covers personal and professional issues for the characters and it keeps you busy keeping up with the plot . ",3
"This is a great book . I wish jack Ryan was a real person running for president so I could vote for him . Too bad there is no politician like himI have this book on kindle and there is A Lot of typos . ",3
"Have you ever fantasized about the possibility ofbecoming president of the United States ? Have you felt youcould do the job at least as well as the folks who have heldit in the past few decades if not better ? Perhaps you havewondered what daytoday life must be like in the WhiteHouse . It looks pretty plush but what would it be like toactually live there ? Or perhaps you wander what the secretservice folks are really like ? If the answer to any of these questions is yes you aregoing to love Executive Orders . The novel begins where Debtof Honor left off and Jack Ryan through a series of eventsI wo n't reveal since some of you may not have read theprevious book yet is now President . And as always he facesa bowl full of crises enough to destroy most men.Let 's see . He has to deal with a new Arab country theUnited Islam Republic created when Iran 's latest leaderarranges for the assassination of Sudam Hussein and takesover that country . China 's leaders also start things goingwhen they provoke a dogfight with some of Taiwan 's fighterplanes and shoot down a civilian airliner in the process.Then Ed Kealty the model of a corrupt politician tries toquestion Ryan 's authority as president and begins to leaksome of the secret missions in which Ryan had participatedwhile in the CIA and which Clancy wrote about in earlierbooks . Appealing to our fears about biological warfare afew new cases of Ebola the most deadly modern virussuddenly spread to our own country . And to keep hisattention sharp there are assassination attempts on bothhimself and his family.As always Clancy jumps from scene to scene perhapsmore than ever . It is well done however and helps to buildsuspense . Thus the events which make up one subplot mayextend for several hundred pages.Interestingly enough this book has not gotten goodreviews from many of Clancy 's readers . They argue that itcontains a lot of irrelevant material particularly in hispolitical exposition . Admittedly he does push his particularphilosophy there is no hidden agenda however for hededicates the book to Ronald Reagan the man who won thewar and many of his ideas are similar to Reagan 's and hisfollowers . I felt however that this was an important partof the book for Ryan is not a professional politician anda main thrust of the novel is his attempt to bring commonsense to the problems that face our nation . I might notalways agree with his solutions but they were quiteconsistent with his character.It is also fun to wonder What if . . . He wants tosimplify the tax code for example by doing away with alltax exemptions and using a flat percentage tax that wouldapply to all income levels . This President Ryan argueswould bring in just as much income from the rich folks whonow use the complexity of the current code to exempt much oftheir income . It would also have the side affect of doingaway with many of the accountants and attorneys whospecialize in tax law a benefit that I suspect some of ouraccountants and attorneys might not see.I recommend this book though I also suggest you readDebt of Honor first to get the background . It 's one of thosethrillers that will keep you from getting any work done ! ",3
"Yes that 's not a typo . Clancy has written a book with over 1300 pages . And so it should come as no surprise that I found the story slow . I mean how many fast paced 1300paged books do you know of ? And I do mean SLOW . For those new to the Ryan story to date exCIA action hero turned cabinet member turned VP is now president after the prior president is killed in a suicide bombing run at the end of Debt of Honor . Not just the president but also just about every other high ranking politico in DC . Is Clancy hinting something here ? . Ryan becomes president and must show the doubters and those evil media types that he is a big man and can do the job . Of course Clancy tries not to stray from his reputation as a techoguru and so he includes discussions on the investigation into the terrorist attack as well as a superficially indepth look at militia life a group of militia folk decide to go after the President.Since his early stories Ryan has become increasingly unlikeable as a character . He will occassionally spout off on rhetoric and make longwinded proclamations on everything from the Russians socalled liberals femanists to the role of women and the media . This books seems to read like Clancy 's own manifesto a book where the author injects his own beliefs into the main character without bothering to be objective . People who disagree with these views or Ryan are depicted as the bad guys . Ryan it seems never makes a mistake he just has tough choices to make the results of which can cause the loss of lives.Clancy creates too many subplots and does surprisingly short shrift with each of them . This is strange after he has spent hundreds of pages developing each subplot . A story about a rival politician is taken care of in quick order near the end of the book in a nice neat package . Other subplots a militia group and terrorist group try to take advantage of the new president also reach anticlimatic and unbelievable conclusions . i do n't want to give a spoiler but Ryan actually orders a military operation to occur at the same time he is live with a U.S. nation kinda like a look do n't mess with us we are serious see what we are doing right this very second ? Unfortunately the long journey to the end of the book is not worth it . What Clancy needs is an editor someone who will tell the guy to cut down his writing . To get on with it . And to remember that what made his earlier books popular was his plot and storylines . And of course someone should ask Clancy to get off his soapbox . ",0
"Clancy 's great gift as a writer has always been his ability to tell a good story and he does a fair job with this one . However this is n't a great story and it 's not very well written . Although the concept is quite interesting Clancy 's writing fails in two critical areas characters and continuity . His characters are generally simple and onesided the villains are easy to hate and the heros are easy to love . Nobody wears a hat but you get the idea nonetheless . Other than the characters that Clancy has developed over multiple books there is n't anyone here who really feels quite real . Clancy fans will still root for Jack Ryan and John Clark but they do n't really have much competition here . As for continuity Clancy loves to pack his novels with subplots which can be a good thing but here he apparently bit off more than he could chew as one subplot is rather arbitrarily cut off . Losing it does not hurt the book but if he was n't going to use Clancy could have improved the book by simply omitting it entirely . Overall the novel offers an interesting look inside a fictional presidency and is a fun read but little more . ",2
"If clancy had put this book on diet it could have been a five star book . The plot is there but it is covered up with needless chatter . You have to be good skimmer to find just the good stuff . This book is a thiller . It is not War and Peace . Maybe Reader 's Digest can turn it into a five star book . ",3
"Make sure to step carefully in this swamp of a Clancy novel . He gives you so much that it takes a guide to wade through the hundreds of plot lines . It is a thoroughly intriguing book but the sheer weight of the novel discourages you . I skipped whole pages which is something of a sacrelige when reading Clancy . However doing this did n't impair the book . It is an excellent book just extremely tiring to read . ",3
"This review is solely for the Kindle version of Executive Orders.This is one of my favorite Clancy novels . I reread it every few years . I repurchased it for the Kindle and must say that this is the most horrible conversion to Kindle I have seen to date . It 's like they just opened up the source file did a SAVEAS and picked Kindle format and went to market with it . It is so full of typos and errors that it looks like it was OCRed . I will be rereading my hardback rather than the Kindle version . ",0
"This book is dedicated to Ronald Wilson Reagan 40th President of the United States the one who is on the U.S . Postal Service with the White House stamps.The second U. S. Pres . John Adams wrote I pray Heaven God to bestow the best of blessings on this house and on all that shall hereafter inhabit it . May none but honest and wise men ever rule or sleep under this roof.Colleen Hitchcock wrote And if I go while you 're still here know that I live on vibrating to a different measure behind a thin veil you can not see through . You will not see me so you must have faith . I wait for the first time when we can soar together again both aware of each other . Until then live your life to the fullest and when you need me just whisper my name in your heart and I will be there.Today I bought this novel and the song The Long Black Veil . They seem to go together . ",2
"You just ca n't go wrong with Clancy . He is easily the best espionagewar writer on the market currently . No one can create a complex interwoven storyline like his . His research is outstanding his fact checking impeccable and his characters fascinating.I still think that Red Storm Rising is the best WWIII book ever written and this book is right up there with it .

"Following the dramatic ending of Debt Of Honor the United States ' new President is none other than Jack Ryan . Finallya President who just does n't take any crap from anyone . With the Ebola virus unleashed and a former Vice President back in the picture raising cain for his own political and personal gain President Ryan has no time to get accustomed to the job . Americans have n't truly had a no nonsense Commander In Chief since the early 80s with Ronald Reagan but Jack Ryan certainly provides that in Executive Orders . If you loved it when Reagan shot a missile into Gadhafi 's tent 20 years ago you will LOVE the final sequence of this one ! At over 1000 pages paperback it 's a long read but a FAST read . Simply a Clancy masterpiece and his best work of the last 8 or 9 years . ",4
"Bought it for my husband . He did n't seem to like it . Said he found him taking a long time and wuite a few words to get some where . ",2
"As with other Clancy novels Executive Orders is full of intrigue and excitement . Before reading it I was unsure I 'd find it interesting thinking that it was more a political story than a militarytype action story found in other Clancy novels but I went ahead and read it and I think it 's one of the best ones I 've read by Clancy . It contains multiple plots concerning reestablishing the government an attack on Jack Ryan and his daughter a biological attack on America and a question of whether or not Ryan is really the president . All of these different happenings help to make this book very exciting and compeling . It 's a book you do n't want to put down . Although this book is rather long and many people have often complained of the length of this book and others by Clancy I appreciate Clancy 's attention to detail even if perhaps sometimes unnecessary . That attention to detail helps the stories to be better written and gives the reader the feeling that Clancy really knows what he 's talking about . Also I 've read Debt of Honor which came before Executive Orders and I think Executive Orders is considerably better . For any true ClancyJack Ryan fan this is worth the read . ",4
"Tom Clancy is a great author I will not take that away from the man . From his first story to his masterpiece Without Remorse he is without a doubt a phenomenal entertainer . His current novels stemming from Debt of Honor yet exclusively within this tale his viewpoints are too prevalent within the tale to truly appreciate . This would not be so bad except for his characters internal soliloquy which are completely out of touch with cultural personalities ie when the Saudi prince wishes his country were more like America not so much . If he were to stay away from detailing his perifial characters whimsical thoughts the novels would be shorter and that much better . I feel he is trying to put too much of his perfect world into the books which ultimately take away from the great entertainment he provides . ",1
"Executive Orders follows in the series of what was easily the worst Jack Ryan novel written so my expectations were a bit tempered prior to reading this novel . After a suicide plane bomber from Japan no less kills off two thirds of the US government Jack Ryan is the president by default . Now he has to deal with an Iranian terrorist group trying to manufacture and spread the ebola virus while trying to get the country 's government back in order . Since most of congress and the senate were killed off in the previous novel a whole new group of legislatures must be elected and Ryan urges for citizen politicians just like in the good old days of this country . Sometimes it 's hard to get past some of the silliness in Clancy 's novel but the plot in this case is pretty solid much improved from the last novel . Jack Ryan is often complaining about the politics of being the president and is better cast as a CIA agent but it was still fun to see him in this new role . Clancy 's novels are never great but they usually are pretty good as is the case in Executive Orders . If you have read other novels in the series you will want to read this one as well.Carl Alves author of Blood Street ",2
"Executive Orders is one of the BEST of the Jack Ryan series of well writtenfinely detailed Tom Clancy books . His writing style and attention to detail keep the reader in the story and well informed.I am a big fan of Tom Clancy . You will like him also.You ca n't find a more entertaining book than most anything from Tom Clancy I have read most of them and still am 'Captured ' by his writing style . ",4
"This book gets only three stars because of all the horrible editing errors . I can only guess that the print edition is better . Every page has multiple errors of interchangeably using e and c. This makes for a frustrating read . The story is typical Clancy . ",2
"For the most part this book follows the traditional Clancy model of an exciting beginning a really long boring middle and an exciting finish . The difference with this one is that the beginning is n't that exciting and the middle is even longer than normal . And again this book would be so much better if it was shorter.There is a really interesting story buried inside but there is so much extraneous material that it 's hard to enjoy . There are subplots that amount to nothing extraneous details that are n't that interesting and a pace that is excruciatingly slow . Cutting out the unnecessary material would probably cut out about 250 pages and that would have made this book enjoyable and better paced . As it is the book is a chore to finish and unsatisfying in the end.I was making an attempt to read through the Tom Clancy books I own but this one was simply too much work . At this point I 'm no longer enjoying Clancy 's writing and I 'm not sure I 'll ever bother to read the rest of his books . ",1
"Wow these plots a n d subplots are so real and plausible it is hard to remember it is fiction . It is fiction right ? ",4
"While having to drive about an hour a day for work I decided to give Clancy a try to help pass the time NPR can only do so much after about a month & lt30 hrs of radio time & gt . The audio CD was wonderful and really helped pass the time . The story is interesting lots of twists turns Clancy technobattles and interesting characters without the volume issue that makes the reader decide what sections to skim.As well I really enjoyed the reader for the book even though I panned Mr. Hermann in ' A Beautiful Mind ' he did a wonderful job here . He paced the desert war the gun battles and the moments of intrigue the leadin and standoff with the rogue secret service agent comes to mind well keeping interest and at times causing me to sit in the car for an extra 510 mins waiting for a scene to play out . All in all a solid 4 stars . ",3
"'Executive Orders ' makes a strong case for being Clancy 's greatest novel . Dealing with the beginnning of Jack Ryan 's Presidency 'Orders ' has Ryan coming to grips with his new situation as chief executive while battling foreign and domestic enemies who seek to undermine the USA . One of the greatest aspects of Clancy 's novels is the optimism in America that they inspire . 'Orders ' in no exception . Thrilling in it 's action daring in it 's philosiphy and just a lot of fun this is truly a great modern American novel . Noit 's not high art but it is what it is A wonderful novel by Tom Clancy . ",4
"This Tom Clancy novel takes quite a while to slug through . And not just because of the number of pages . The author takes his sweet time developping the numerous plotlines in this book . A little too much time in this reader 's opinion . But the plots themselves seem so interesting that you do keep reading on skipping perhaps a few useless paragraphs along the way.Clancy starts off with the destruction of the greater part of the American government body and adds to that political turmoil involving Iran and Irak biological warfare on the USA with the Ebola virus and much more . The only plot that starts and then goes nowhere is the one regarding the former vicepresident who tries to discredit Jack Ryan 's appointment as president . It 's as if Clancy just lost interest in this matter or just did n't know what to do with it and just decided to let it die out hoping readers would n't notice.In these times of possible war reading such a novel makes you wonder if terrorists wo n't take some of the ideas presented by the author and actually decide to apply them . A little scary.If you have a lot of time on your hands and enjoy reading politicalmilitary novels then by all means read this book . If not you might get annoyed by the use of every possible military acronym out there and not all of them explained to the readerand the very slow developping plot . There are many more interesting books out there some of them even written by Tom Clancy . ",2
"Tome Clancy is a great author and I look forward to any new books in the Jack Ryan series . Fast paced and a good read . ",4
"I have enjoyed Tom Clancy 's novels over the years and have followed Jack Ryan 's fictional career with interest . For a while my life events got in the way of continuing my reading of the series and I only just now read Executive Orders well after the real events of 911 . How eerily prescient in many ways is Mr. Clancy 's world of the real one.Jack Ryan is catapulted into the Presidency of the United States by the events at the close of Debt of Honor in which a Japanese airline pilot crashes his plane into the Capitol during an expanded joint session of Congress wiping out most of the higher Congressional and Executive parts of government along with the Supreme Court . President Ryan is truly a citizenstatesman not a politician and has to gain the support of regular Americans while rebuilding the government . Add to his difficulties an attempted takeover by the ousted former vicepresident a kidnapping attempt on his younger daughter an assassination attempt on himself a largescale bioterrorism attack on the US a domestic terrorist bombing attempt saberrattling by China and India and an actual war with the United Islamic Republic the union of Iran and Iraq after the successful assassination of the Iraqi leader and you have the usual multifaceted Clancy plotting which keeps you glued to the book . And given the usual Clancy book length approaching 900 pages of small font print in the hardcover edition reading it takes a while and can lead to spousal irritation . Especially compelling are insights into the Presidency with Ryan 's attempts to cope with the office and the climactic battle scenes played out over the final 100 pages or so . As usual the good guys win although the cost is high.I 'm a registered Democrat but I 'd vote for Jack Ryan with his honest straightforward decisive governing style . Whither next Mr. Ryan ? Onto The Bear and the Dragon . ",4
"For those of us who are n't savvy on the type of equipment Military jargon and political goings on this really digs deep and makes you feel like your in the meetings and the battles ! ",3
"Aside from Clancy 's obvious conservative viewpoints in this book I really enjoyed it . I 've wondered about what would happen if there was a mass destruction at the top of the U. S. government . This book helps answer that question . Of course with Ryan at the helm things are going to get dicey but that 's OK after all any President has dicey situations to deal with . It was a realistic look at a government in crisis . We could do a lot worse than have a Jack Ryan at the helm in a situation like this . ",4
"A very good read but somewhat long it also seemed to finish with all subplots then go into real heavy technowar then come back with a interesting ending . Who am I to buck success . All in all another good book and would we all like to have a President that could talk as President Ryan did in the final pages ? . God Bless America . ",3
"A nice followup to Debt of Honor . If you like Clancy you 'll enjoy this one.My only complaint is that once the action gets going it 's hard to put down I found myself unable to stop reading at 230 in the morning . ",3
"This book builds on Clancy 's previous Jack Ryannovels . It may not be as actionpacked as hisprevious novels but it builds more on thecharacters . As loyal readers who have followedRyan 's journey from the periphery to the center ofUS government policy we have seen him develop andstrengthen his views and politics . He seems to bea man for the nineties as he has leanings bothliberal and conservative . This presents a view of what Americans may need in government someonewho is n't bound to just one ideology.The undeveloped plotlines show a work in progress.I am eagerly anticipating the next installment to see what intrigue and villians develop next . As well having followed Jack Ryan 's career from a lowly history professor to the most powerfull man in the world I ca n't wait to see how he handles his next challenges.Clancy has another winner !

"Jack Ryan is President of the United States and finds his nation at war with terrorists who have released a plague on the country . Iran is on the march to take over the Middle East supported by India . And the United States must use its now limited resources to support its Arab allies . I had heard that Clancy was questioned by the CIA on where he got his information for this book and I can believe it . It rings as real as the headlines of the war that followed in truth . Jack Ryan may not know much about politics but he sure knows a lot about being a strong leader and a man . Clancy was once again the master . Wo n't give much more away except to say Go Wolfpack . ",4
"Tom Clancy has been the master of the spy novel for the better part of two decades . Now in Executive Orders Clancy tackles the headaches of the power found within the Washington beltway . At the end of the last book Clancy 's hero Jack Ryan found himself a sort of unwilling vice president who became the most unlikely of presidents . Now with the president Congress and the Supreme Court all decimated Ryan must face rebuilding the government while fending off challenges from international and domestic conspirators.As always Clancy tends to get caught up in the details and innerworkings of virtually everything from the ebola virus to a crack military unit . The result is a novel that is close to 1400 pages long and the reader feels the weight of every turning page for the first half of the book . However once the plot finally begins to thicken around page 650 or so it becomes very hard to put this book down . President Ryan becomes more of a collateral character in the book as others like John Clark circle around their leader to solve various crises . As the action builds to a crescendo the book begins to steamroll with new twists and revelations on each page.Executive Orders is a very good book but it is far from the best that Clancy has turned out . The previous two books Sum of All Fears and Debt of Honor set up the plot of Executive Orders and are much more tightly written . But if you are a Clancy fan this is still a must and it wo n't disappoint . ",3
"This novel is the culmination of the Jack Ryan saga . Gripping intense and thoroughly believable . Jack Ryan has been one of my favorite characters since his debut . Every new saga was eagerly anticipated . This final novel is the perfect ending to the years of pleasure . It picks up where the previous novel left off with Jack Ryan being sworn in as President . As usual he capably handles adversity while maintaining his humanity . This is Tom Clancy 's best work ever ! This series is one you can enjoy many times . It 's worth rereading the entire set more than once . I have . ",4
"I ca n't improve upon the other reviews on this page . I just wanted to say that it was awesome that finally Ryan is in a position of power . I love Clark and his presence within the storyline is minimal but strong . Great Job Mr. Clancy . ",4
"As life follows fiction you have to wonder if this is a novel or a script for these terrorists.Read it while listening tothe news and you 'll hardly will be able to tell them apart . ",4
"A new president a commercial airliner crashing into a landmark Washington DC building a fight against bioterrorism on US soil and a madman in the Middle East hiding behind Islam as justification for his actions . Sound familiar ? Published over five years ago Tom Clancy 's Executive Orders has eerily become in many ways an unfortunate reality . Simply put one may never be able to consider a Clancy novel a pure form of escapism again.But despite the unsettling nature of the novel in light of recent events Executive Orders is an engaging and informative read . Readers may feel like they are getting an inside glimpse of the White House as Clancy superprotagonist Jack Ryan reluctantly ascends to the Presidency of the United States . Clancy 's knowledge on a wide variety of topics and his ability to keep dozens of narratives afloat in this 1300+ page novel is truly amazing . The sheer thickness and complexity of Executive Orders definitely calls for some perseverance but for the most part it is worth effort . ",3
"This was the longest book I 've read in my entire life literally and it felt like it.I had not read any of Tom Clancy 's book though I have seen and enjoyed the Jack Ryan movies . Executive Orders finds Ryan as a reluctant president after a terrorist act destroyed much of the government . There are many plot threads which Clancy cuts back and forth between throughout the book . Unfortunately some like the China subplot are boring and others such as the story involving a rightwing militia group end up being irrelevant to the rest of the book.Many of the early pages are spent on Ryan 's words and thoughts about how the government should be run aka putting forth Clancy 's political ideas . The pace does pick up considerably at around page 900 but 899 is a lot of pages to slog through to get to that point ! Those like myself who do not have an encyclopedic knowledge of military terms and weaponry will likely find the big climax of the book confusing.With a lot of editing this book could have been suspenseful . However it is about 900 pages longer than it needs to be . I am just glad its over ! ",1
"The continuing story of Jack Ryan now President of the USA and the trials thrown upon him by the leaders of the world . Again Clancy can write a compelling novel keeping track of his immense complexities with ease requiring his reader to follow to the bitter end to see the outcome . The problem again arises in the very complexities he weaves Like life Clancy 's novels have more people than can conveniently be kept track of and i am not one to set up a Rolodex file for the purpse of reading a book nor do i enjoy flipping back the pages i 've read to rediscover who i 'm reading about thus i find that all too often i have to read a sentence or two of the new paragraph to be reminded just who the particular character is what their complaint about Ryan is and what they are in the process of doing about it . All of which is not to say i dislike Clancy just that reading him takes a greater effort to keep track of characters than reading anything less than the geneological lists in the book of Numbers .

"By the most amazing of coincidences I was in the middle of this book on September 11 2001 . After so far reading that a plane had crashed into the Pentagon and that there was a Middle Eastern conspiracy to spread disease througout America was I reading the most timely book in the world or what ? I liked this book very much . I just gave Stephen King 's Black House a negative review because it was a long novel that did n't go very far very fast . This is a very long novel and it held me the whole way.Primarily there 's the basic story of the plot to attack America . As we all know crashing a plane into a public building is not as farfetched as one would have thought . And neither is the idea of spreading disease as a terrorist act . Yes the good guys eventually win at a price and how our country goes about it is riveting.Then there 's the issue of handling the Muslim religion . Yes the rules of the religion are in total contrast to how many of their followers interpret it . Yes many of the faith officially decree that these tactics are terrible . But is there any other religion in the world that has so many leaders sanction the violence that is happening in the world ? A recent poll indicates that a large part of the Muslim world approves of the way things are being done . This book explores this world very well.Finally there is a more human part of the story that 's interesting . What would you do if you were suddenly and totally unexpectedly made President of the United States ? This is the role laid on Jack Ryan and the everyday life changes he has to undergo while handling the crisis really flesh out the book . It 's very revealing that the most powerful man in the world has many of his freedoms taken away and is very possibly spied upon twentyfour hours a day by the people in charge of keeping our country secure.I 've yet to read a bad Tom Clancy novel .

"Tom Clancy 's longtime hero former CIA analyst Jack Ryan has managed to assume the Presidency Gerald Fordstyle without ever having been elected on a presidential ticket.Unlike Ford however Ryan had never been elected to any public office at all . Asked by President Durling to serve as Vice President after the previous Vice President is forced to resign in the wake of a sex scandal Ryan reluctantly agrees to take on a largely ceremonial office . The catch for the nonpolitician Ryan however is that the VicePresidency is only a heartbeat away from the most burdensome job in the world and one which Ryan shivers at the thought of undertaking.Then the incredible happens when a griefstriken Japanese pilot who lost family in a brief JapaneseAmerican shooting war mans a jumbo jet during Ryan 's swearingin ceremony and crash lands into the Capitol thereby all but obliterating government . The President First Lady the entire Supreme Court nearly all the Cabinet and most Senators and members of Congress are killed in a few calamitous moments.This leaves Ryan who survived by a sheer fluke to assume an office which he frankly dreads approaching . A complete political outsider Ryan has an excellent working knowledge of the government but close to zero political instincts . A populist and technophile of the sort both idolized and unelected by America Ryan must bumble through his grief and shock at the horror which has befallen his nation and attempt to lead it . His hostility toward any form of ideology that appears other than starkly pragmatic however is ultimately disappointing . In the guise of nonpartisan vigor Clancy has Ryan deliver a series of startlingly conservative speeches praising a flat tax and denouncing abortion rights.If Ryan 's syrupy claims to integrity are occassionally enough to set one 's teeth on edge Clancy establishes a magnificent character in India the Prime Minister of the world 's largest democracy . Referring to her only by the name of the country she represents Clancy cleverly harkens back to the medieval language of kings who refer to one another by the name of their countries . India is a nearly Picassoan study in minimalism . Only a few lines here and there richly summon up the mental image of the face of Benazir Bhutto masking the mind of Indira Gandhi . India 's supernaturally beautiful English conveys all at once the history of her nation her class origins and educational background her exquisite mendacity and diplomatic sophistication.One masterpiece is a conversation between India and Ryan in which he attempt to secure her promise of safe passage of American vessels through the Indian ocean . India effortlessly evades Ryan 's direct request a number of ways each time protesting offense and hurt feelings on behalf of her nation . While India is written as a villain in Clancy 's novel conspiring against America her delicious sophistication elevates her far above the supposedly wellintentioned lummox that is America . India 's protests on behalf of her sovereign nation as Ryan attempts to shove her military around will resonate deeply amongst Clancy 's international audience as he is surely aware.In the meantime America 's vulnerability is a huge source of inspiration to any number of enemies both foreign and domestic . Ryan 's forte and Clancy 's as well is in the field of international relations and an array of hostile nations India China Iran and Iraq plan intricate attacks on the American homeland and its new President.Clancy has a speechwriter inform Jack Ryan that his use of language while correct and to the point is far from poetic . Clearly the same can be said of Tom Clancy . But what Clancy lacks in artful turns of phrase he makes up for in scholarship . None of the attacks dreamed up by foreign powers against America are in themselves totally unbelieveable it is only their sheer number and simulteneity that gives Executive Orders a farfetched quality.Tom Clancy 's immense learning about weapons systems military manoeuvers Pentagon and CIA operations is put to superb use . Even an outbreak of the Ebola virus in Zaire which is quickly capitalized upon by the new United Islamic Republic composed of former enemies Iran and Iraq is described with striking and quite remarkable clinical accuracy . The governmental institutions he describes are entirely real . Clancy 's gift is for taking the world of politics as he expertly knows it to be and rearranging a few pieces on the chessboard to suggest fictional events evolving from familiar institutions.A large amount of the pleasure derived from a Clancy novel comes from simply being able to follow it . The acronyms are endless yet largely accurate and nonfictional . Clancy is the ultimate man 's man sharing his war stories in warmly confidential tones allowing the reader the great vicarious pleasure of merely comprehending testing each piece of data and finding most to be accurate and real.While many readers will note a kind of jump the shark quality to Ryan 's extraordinary assumption of the Presidencyfor where else had he to go in Clancy 's imaginary career trajectory ? the book has an indisputably educational quality for students of geopolitics . World leaders use subjective impressions gleaned at diplomatic receptions to decide upon military gambits . Everyone in politics and in the military has an agenda noble or not and all leaders use a range of discursive strategies to communicate with the public the international community their cabinets and with other leaders . None of these 'voices ' is entirely sincere or truthful and some are not a bit of either.Clancy will establish in his readers the important instinct toward looking for the everpresent subtext behind every public speech and pronoucement and for this reason alone at least one or two of his novels should be attempted by any serious student of politics .

"As my college psychology professor urged us You ca n't believe everything you read . So maybe mom said it too . Anyway as for this book the action is just fabulous for those of us who really do n't mind all the nittygritty details of our county 's operation . I 've read several Clancy novels and I enjoyed the realistic possibilities in the books but this one stretched the fine line . If Clancy is trying to make any point at all besides how lousy most politicians really are it 's to say that perhaps this COULD happen some day and do we have the right man in office to handle such a crisis ? ",3
"An electric and fascinating insight on the US Presidency . This was superb the only flaws being the IndiaChina angle which seemed to go nowhere and the Grade Z Mountain Men which are right out of a junior school essay . Ignoring those the way Jack Ryan becomes President forms a government out of the people that are left after Sato ` s kamikaze attack on the Capitol and the way he slips up when dealing with issues such as criminal justice and abortion are highly realistic . The Ebola Zaire plot and the United Islamic Republic angle are both extremely well crafted even if the idea does seem as though it was copied from the movie Outbreak at times . Mind you the monkey culling scenes and the description of the effects of the disease made that movie seem like pure Disney . Overall though this book is one you ` ll need plenty of time to read because despite the odd flaw it has the Tom Clancy trademark of being extremely hard to put down ! Jack Ryan should return for another term of Presidency but what crisis can Clancy cook up this time ? ! ",4
"There is a story to me buying this book . I had never read clancy before November of 2002 right now I am reading Bear and the Dragon and I have read them all to this point . When I first saw Executive Orders on a shelf in Albertson 's I figured long book a lot of points for a book report . So I bought it . I go home open it up and read the description . And it was there that I saw I needed to read Debt of Honor first . Later I realized that this book was part of a series . Okay now for the review.The book was long . The beginning is okay as it concludes Debt of Honor but most of the rest of the book is boring and extremely long winded . The majority of it is spent with Ryan whining about how he hates being president . Another problem is the Ed Keality story line . In goes hot and heavy for awhile then it disappears and ends in a simple manner that makes one wonder in Clancy just got bored . The same is true of the subplot about the Mountain men it goes nowhere . You have at leat twohundred pages devoted tot hem then they disappear only to have no effect on the main story and I mean this in the most literal sense . It truly goes absolutely nowhere yet he writes the leads for as if it will be the big conclusion and maybe cause this novel to end like Debt of Honor.One thing I enjoyed was that Clark and Chavez got a decent amount of time in the book . They have become my favorite characters in the Ryan universe and so I always looked forward to their coming.Now this book has too many subplots to count most of which are pointless . The disease helps set up Rainbow Six as does the key climax help show who Clark is again . Aside from that is is obvious that clancy wrote this to set a personal record for page length.To end as this is one of my most poorly written reviews a lot of this book is a set up for the Bear and the Dragon where you learn further that despite saying other wise Ryan does not have respect for others nor does he take into account this is noticed in this paper weight as well that some of his actions are truly unconstitutional . I 'm sorry Clancy but I was disappointed . Stick to things that are good . You prefer to make us know you have a greater intelligence than us when dealing with governemnt policies and military strategies . We knew this since Red October.I recomend finding cliffnotes on this novel or skipping this novel entirely . It is better to go back to the Cardinal of the kremlin and The Sum of All Fears or skip ahead to Rainbow Six.What else can I say except that I am looking forward to when Jack Ryan dies . Too much has been written about this man whose luck would get him thrown out of Las Vegas and after becoming president he 'll never be able to go on any adventures Red October Cardinal Clear and present again .

"I bought it when it was first published in 1996 . An incredibly gripping novel . So many plots so many twists . Filled with bad guys worse guys and down right evil characters . Like many Clancy novels EO pulls back the curtain behind everything from infectious diseases to the TO & E of an Armored Cavalry Regiment . After several years I bought a used copy and it consumed my entire weekend from Friday night to Monday night . I actually got weepy eyed during some parts Cathy Ryan as she was treating Ebola victims in Baltimore the tactics of the North Carolina brigade as they clobbered the UIR forces.Just an amazing book . Worth readingagain . It is a long book though . The paperback weighed in at 1358 pages . I still ca n't believe I read the entire thing . lol . ",4
"This book is book two of a trilogy with Debt of Honor being book one and The Bear And The Dragon being book three so a lot of background events will be missed and the reader will be a bit confused if this book is read without reading Debt of Honor . That said I am a big fan of Tom Clancy and own all of his books in paperback and have read all of them but four . He tells a good story and gives you an opportunity to learn a thing or two about politics the military and technology even going so far as to give the historic info about discovery and development of such things as our touch tone telephone system for one example . He makes it fairly clear that there are certain kinds of people he does n't care for dishonest politicians liberal politicians and their mostly antimilitary philosophy political subversives and environmentalists . That said what is scary about this book and the trilogy as a whole is that all the events from the start of Debt Of Honor to the end of The Bear And The Dragon could conceivably happen . What I noticed about this book is that intentionally or not Mr. Clancy has actually written up a roadmap for recovery from the most unimaginably bad disaster and turn of events before and after that are chillingly real and possible . A very good read hard to put down . ",4
"I got the audio CDs to listen to while I went on vacation in Mexico since it was easier to carry five CDs and a CD player than it was to lug around the book . The story was great and the reader was excellent with his ability to add accents to the characters . There were parts of the story where I cheered the reader did such a fine job though this got a few curious stares from the other people who I was also around the pool . ",4
"This has been a great series and it is one I love to take with me when I travel Okay I always pretend Mister Clark is on my flight and I try to figure out where he is ! ",4
"A Jappanese pilot slams a passenger jet into the capital building killing the president along with much of congress and the supreme court . Two low lifes plot to assasinate the president by default Jack Ryan . Another man who believes he should be president tries to dig up dirt on Jack Ryan and bring him down . A powerful alliance called the UIR United Islamic Republic is formed . The UIR then attacks the US by introducing a deadly strain of the ebola virus into the population and plot 's to assasinate the president and to kidnap his daughter . Meanwhile India and China 's navy and Air Force is actingsuspiciously . These are exciting plots and I 'll add that the one involving the ebola virus was down right disturbing . Unfortuantely not all of these plots and issues were fully resolved at least not to my satisfaction . Since this is largely a political thriller I think the author could have gone into some of the economic ramifications of what happens.Tom Clancy writes well and seems to have a heavy interest in military weaponry and tactics but is not very culturally literate and hence makes mistakes and appears awkward when writing about nonamericans and nonChristians . A Muslimregardless of sect can never pray for a dead or dying person of another faith to go to heaven . Most people who read the part of the book where a Muslim doctor is praying for a Catholic nun would not think anything of it . This appears not only stupid to us Muslims but contrary to our belief . Another thing which occurs throughout the book is the use of anglicized foreign names particularly with Muslim names . It seems as thoughthe names are simply phony as if anything which looks good was just slapped on the page and therefore takes away from some of the realism and drama of the story . The people in the story who are supposed to be foreigners Indian Iranian Chinese etc . just do n't seem convincing to me . It always seemed like he waswriting from an American 's frame of reference . Iranians may not like Arabs but they would never call the Saudis goatherds . I do n't know where the term goatherd came from but Iranians and Arabs equally find it offensive . Also using the pejorative term raghead does n't add anything to the entertainment value of the story.One other thing about the book which annoyed me were the hackneyed references to going to the bathroom . A few were ok but after a while I saw them coming . One would think that he would be more creative than that.If you wish to read a thriller writer who can cut across different nationalities with ease and sound convincing and balanced read some of Frederick Forsyth 's books .

"Let rate each of the major plotlines in the book in true U.S. Navy fashion of Outstanding Excellent Good Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory . SPOILER ALERT spoilers abound.The Asia Minor war with the United Islamic Republic . First off I must note that Jack Ryan is not a good president . His unpresidential conduct e.g . maudlin funeral service made him and by extension his country look weak . Something to think about when we elect the next president . Second we now know that Iran taking over Iraq in a matter of days is not something that could happen . Iran can barely control itself let alone another country . The land air and sea battles were fairly well done however . Rating good.Ebola terrorism . Well done with the exception that Ding and Chavez pop up Zeliglike to provide crucial information about who has been experimenting with monkeys . The retribution at the end was fantastic JDAMs on the mullahinchief 's house especially and my only question is Why not use a highlevel nuclear bomb to destroy the lab instead of a lowlevel one ? Rating excellent.The assassination attempt on Jack . The idea of a Mohammedan sleeper agent is certainly plausible post 911 postLackawanna Sleeper Cell . I did n't like the fact that catching the rogue Secret Service agent depended in part on luck but it was certainly presented in a plausible way . Rating excellent.The assassination attempt on SANDBOX . I 'm getting tired of kids in jep . Clancy skillfully played that card in Patriot Games but I 'm a little annoyed to see it come up again here . The only thing that saves this plotline from Unsatisfactory rating is the vivid description of the assault and the takedown of the bad guys . Rating satisfactory.The Mountain Men . Did n't go anywhere and was unnecessary . Unsatisfactory.Edward Kealty tries to muscle back into the presidency . A little absurd but does present interesting legal issues . Rating good.Running the government . Clancy obviously took the chance to tell us everything he would change if he were president but it wound up being just a series of political speeches that any competent editor could have stopped . Two hundred or more pages could have been taken out of the book in this part alone and it would have been far better . Clancy needs an editor with some backbone for his sake as well as ours . Rating unsatisfactory . ",2
"Picks up where Debt of Honor left off and finds Ryan fighting to keep America from imploding . A covert group bent on the destruction of America has attack the stock market in order to cripple the world economies save a few minor players who stand to gain heavily from the demise of the West . Just goes to show the saying ` If you did n't write it down it never happened ' is more than a clich & eacute . As if that were not enough a new strand of Ebola has been manufactured and released intentionally on America . ",3
"This is the follow up book to Debt of Honor and is Tom Clancys ' best . Fast exciting complicated . Has to be read in a quiet room with no distractions . If you are a fan of Jack Ryan this is the ultimate book for you . ",4
"Executive Orders is a very indepth following its writer 's style political war book written by the masterful author Tom Clancy . It takes over where Dept of Honor left off a terrorist has just crashed an airliner into the capital building as the hero of Clancy 's novels Jack Ryan is being sworn in as the vice president . Everyone except for Ryan and five or so congressmen and a judge or two is dead including the president . With Ryan the vice president with nobody above him he naturally but unwillingly ascends to the role of President of the United States . He has to find out who 's behind the attack . Unfortunately as the president he 's taking the nastiness of politics in Washington deadon . And to make matters worst there 's turmoil in the Middle East . Iran is making its move and India and China are stirring up trouble too . Even worse there 's a massive outbreak of Ebola in the U.S. and the reason is n't looking very natural . Jack has to piece together a whole government from scratch almost under the pressure of the entire world and his government and the pressure of terrorists trying to take advantage of the chaos in the U.S . It 's one of the most satisfying Tom Clancy reads and one of his more human ones too . I highly recommend it to anyone who has the time to do so . ",4
"I bought this book awhile back and with my summer vacation I finally had the chance to tackle this long book . It 's 800 plus pages in the hardcover version . Anyway like some reviewers have said here you need to read the other books if you want to be clear on everything that is going on in this book . The story was good typical Clancy stuff and I consider myself a fan . The negatives for this novel is that this could have been cut down at least 200 pages . Takes too long to get going but once everything is in place then the story takes off . The only other negative is that there is a story of some Mountain Men and for me it was a waste could have been cut altogether and the novel would have been fine . One final thing the politics that President Ryan has is a little simliar to Bush for some people that might be great and while for others it might be a little spooky . ",3
"Through a twist of events Jack Ryan is thrust into the presidency . Not at all sure he wants this tremendous responsibility or the politics that goes with it he does n't even get the luxury of a honeymoon period before he must face a horrible breakout of Ebola . As always life is one catastrophe after another and Jack performs admirably . This is a great book rivaling his earlier Red Storm Rising for excitement . Of course it screams for a sequel which has been a long time coming . The Bear and the Dragon will be released in August 2000I 've already preordered it ! ",4
"The Jack Ryan series and the spin offs never fail to supply great content ans ewasy reading . Another top notch job ",4
"Executive Orders is an excellent continuation of Debt of Honor . Although it may not be accurate it leads to a fictional view of how pressure filled being the President of the United States is . I like the Jack Ryan stories from Clancy a little bit more then the John CLark ones since they seem to be more encompassing with Politics War and other details for NSA of the US.All in all a great book a great plot and you never feel slow when reading this book . Great pacing . ",4
"The whole series of Jack Ryan books are a must read if you are interested at all in the political politics and follow current trends in Government . These Executive Orders are a little different from President Bush and President Obama but that is the idea where this story line came from . Jack Ryan 's Executive Orders are much more exciting and he is an independent with no party affiliation so Democrat 's and Republicans can both be interested in this series . Jim H . ",4
"Right up front I certainly do n't share Clancy 's political leanings slightly to the right of Rush Limbaugh . But that 's not what occasions my rating at least I hope not . I have thoroughly enjoyed every single Ryan book to this point but in this novel Ryan ceases to be a mere mortal and takes on characteristics that remind me of a Christ figure who also happens to be a Republican . In the midst of Ryan 's CONSTANT lament that he is not a politician we are treated to hisClancy 's views on VERY political issues from the top ten on the Clancy 'hit list ' lawyers professional politicians feminists members of the press gun control advocates the Chinese the Indians We are treated to Ryan 's constant suffering via his soliquies on his his unworthiness . Sometimes Ryan 's lines take this cup from me I am not worthy . why me oh Lord sound like a new chapter from the New Testament . At one point Ryan bemoans the fate of 11 American passengers on an airline shot down by the Chinese He was the president he was supposed to PROTECT his people . He had failed them . Finally and way too late his own press secretary tells him Jack you 're not God . Of course all the GOOD and TRUE people love Jackreal Americans military doctors business men and those who come to know himwho recognize his integrity and his sincerity and his all around heroic character.When you can get away from Ryan 's constant agony he begins to remind me of Patricia Cornwall 's tortured protagonist Kay Scarpatta the novel is very intertesting . As usual Clancy does his homework and emerges as very knowledgeable on so many subjects the mind boggles . And the other regulars are reassuringly normal John Clark DingPat and Ed Foley . Lots of suspense lots of good stuff . But I got so I wanted to skip over the testiment according to Jack Ryan to get to the real meat of the novel . ",1
"I 've read a lot of the criticism about Executive Orders and I agree with some of it . So what ? It 's not perfect . Then again what book is ? If you 're looking for hightech action political intrigue and lots of pageflipping fun you 'll enjoy this book . The terrorist attack at the end of Debt of Honor leaves Jack Ryan in the oval office and he has very little time to get his feet on the ground before the next national emergency strikes . Flawless realism ? No . Pulsepounding fun ? You bet . ",4
"Jack Ryan gets a small promotion to president and gathers his friends to save the world . DOH is my favorite nonstar wars book and EO starts immediately following the events of DOH . I have to Paperback and Abridged Audio CD 's of both.Do n't want to give away spoilers by Ryan and his country and in real bad shape and vulnerable . Clancey does an amazing job creating the threats and an even more imaginative job of defeating the threats . ",4
"Thrust into the White House by a terrorist attack that kills the President and most of Congress Jack Ryan may finally be out of his depth . He 's not going to get a free ride either as an unscrupulous Middle Eastern leader takes advantage of America 's temporary weakness to launch a major military offensive against his neighboring nations . Before Jack has a chance to get his bearings he 's faced with a war in the gulf region a kidnapmurder attempt on his own children and a biological warfare attack on the United States . That should be enough to keep anyone busy but Jack Ryan also finds himself battling the deposed former Vice President for control of the nation not to mention an assasination plot within the Secret Service.It takes Tom Clancy a little while to get all the wheels spinning but once he does this book turns into a juggernaut . The military action is fierce and thoroughly exciting . Faced with nearly overwhelming odds the U.S. military must depend on hightech weaponry and superior training and tactics to win the day . Will it be enough ? Buy the book and find out.Jeff Edwards Author of Torpedo A Surface Warfare Thriller ",4
"I am a HUGE Clancy fan and I have been since reading his first novel back in 1985I believe 'Executive Orders ' to be the last honestly good novel Clancy has written The Bear & The Dragon Red Rabbit and The Teeth of the Tiger have all fallen flat . Events in this book are swift and immediate from the opening page . Upon the ending to Debt of Honor in which a mini war with Japan is waged the Vice President is forced from office and the current Executive Chief requests Jack Ryan to sit in the remaining term as VP . He reluctantly agrees and just as he finishes being sworn into the position a lone Japanese Airline pilot crashes a 747 into the Capitol Building in DC . Yes this is all pre911 . Within seconds of becoming a VERY reluctant VP Ryan finds himself the Leader of the Free World literally upon the death of the President.A rather large number of politicians are also killed in the crash and the country is immediately thrown into chaos . Clancy does a remarkable job of helping us understand why Ryan believes the way he does and gives us some startling examples of why Government ought to change and examples of how to do it . I got ta tell you I agreed with the vast majority of it . Yes Ryan 's slant is decidedly Conservativeso this may rub our friends to the Left the wrong way but I do n't believe Clancy intended it to . He sets the stage in great detail many would say too MUCH detail as to exactly WHY Ryan says what he says and is who he is and if taken in that light I do n't find it offensive regardless of which way you lean politically . I may be wrong but that is my opinion on the matter.Jack Ryan quickly becomes embroiled in several messes all at once . From a plot to kidnap his children to a very drawnout and overdetailed plot to bring a manmade strain of ebola to our shores and unleash it on as many as possible . There are several additional subplots all traveling along and whether you are into that sort of thing or not for the most part I felt Clancy handled them all pretty well . I only have two small gripes # 1 . Too much detailWAY too much . I believe a strongwilled editor could have chopped a good 300+ pages without sacrificing anything to the plot at all Actually I think it more like 400+ but who cares ? . # 2 . The ebola plot reminded me a bit too much of a similar plot in Rainbow Six . I do n't see too many other people mentioning this so maybe I happen to be the only one but I thought it was worth bringing up all the same.All that aside Executive Orders is another worthy addition to the Jack Ryan series . Unfortunately since taking the Oval Office the character will be difficult to perpetuate as in novels past which may be why Clancy wrote Red Rabbit which takes place in between Patriot Games & Hunt For Red October and why he has introduced Jack Jr. in his most recent and MUCH thinner Teeth of the Tiger . Regardless my belief is that this is Clancy 's last really decent novel . The others have been aboveaverage for the TechnoThriller genre that Clancy himself helped originate but they were subpar when compared with his earlier works . Again this is only my opinion but lagging book sales seem to prove my point . I just wish we could start all over again and go back to when Jack could go at it in the thick of the action and not have to worry about Secret Service Agents watching his every move . ",3
"Jack Ryan is doing his best . He took the opportunity to become VicePresident as his way out of government service he 'd serve then retire to teaching . But then things went wrong and the President most of Congress the Supreme Court and the cabinet were killed in a terrorist action . Jack Ryan finds himself the head of the country a job he never wanted.Faced with being the most important President since George Washingon he faces a press who thinks he is playing by political rules an enemy in the middle East who is out to cripple the country and an exVice President who claims he never really resigned.The middleeast thinks he 's weak because he wo n't crush political enemies . The press pounces on him because he is being honest in a political world of dishonesty . His enemies think it 's the right time to cripple the country with an attack on the country and an attack on his daughter.The question Clancy asks is clear could another man faced with a devestation of the American political system rise to the occassion and reject tyrnany and kingdom over democratic law . Plus could he if faced with terrible domestic and foreign policy issues make the right choices to combat threats both foreign and domestic.Executive Orders put Jack Ryan an honest man who served his country the best he could in the position of being President . He wanted strict constituational law but was willing to take a step beyond it in preventing free travel in the wake of germ warfare crisis and very willing to be impeached and removed from office as a cost of his decision.Jack Ryan is the hero of the everyday man somebody who understands the world and the threats and is willing to admit his weakness in domestic affairs . When facing rebuilding the government he wants people who really know what the real world is like . In the end he neither wants or craves power he just wants to do what he thinks is the right thing .

"I am normally not a fiction reader . However as my kids grow up and I spend more time in the car shuttling them around I began listening to audio books . I came across a copy of Executive Orders for cheap and decided to give it a listen.The basic premise of the story is that Jack Ryan unwittingly becomes President of the United States after a Japanese airliner crashes and kills most of the high ranking members of the US government leaving Ryan as the next successor to the Presidency . Ryan has the gargantuan feat of rebuilding the entire US government . Of course there is no mercy for the new comer . A skirmish between China and Taiwan breaks out resulting in the deaths of a handful of Americans with both countries pointing the finger at the other . However the story gets interesting as Iran becomes a puppeteer manipulating countries and orchestrating events in a covert attempt to take over part of the Middle East . During all this President Ryan has to deal with a legal attack claiming he is not the President and try to unravel the bureaucracy that had become business as usual in Washington DC and try to rebuild America.I found the storyline to be a bit too political but overall it had a good combination of mental mind games covert operations and good old violence . I thought the scene with the attempted kidnapping of Sandbox was one of the pinnacles of the story . This was a beautifully orchestrated suspenseful scene.I thought Edward Herrmann 's performance in the audiobook version was extraordinary . While sometimes his accents were terribly unrealistic he gave a great performance that made me feel like I was listening to a live news report with the events unfolding right before me.Overall I was pleased with the story . The overall story line seemed reminiscent of the Rocky movies the underdog man who no one thinks will win takes a beating but comes off of the ropes swinging their way to victory . If you are looking for a great underdog story this may be worth a read . However if political discussions turn you off you might want to pick a different book . ",3
"The events that happen in this book are extremely important to the Jack Ryan story I 'm not spoiling anything but the first few pages will have you not only at your heels but also unable to put the book down ! Its quite long though so do n't expect to read it in a few days ",4
"Very good book but way too long ! I AM A big Tom Clancy fan but the book was so long that I WOULD have to go back to keep up with all the playersI would still recommend . the book but warn the reader to plan on having to take more than a few days to read ",3
"Typical Tom Clancy . Excellent story . This should be required reading for all civic classes . Excellent approach to building a new government . ",4
"Executive Orders is Tom Clancy 's follow up to his best selling novel Debt of Honor and begins moments after the ending of the previous novel . Debt of Honor left the Capitol building destroyed the President killed most of Congress killed and all 9 members of the Supreme Court killed . Most other top officials of the government were also killed in a horrible attack reminiscent of September 11 2001 even though the novel was written years before that event . While not intending to be Tom Clancy was very prophetic in writing about the events that led up to Executive Orders . Because the Vice President had resigned Jack Ryan was asked to take his place until the next election . As Vice President Jack Ryan was not in the building when the attacks took place . Being Vice President was only supposed to be a oneyear post and then he would retire from public service . Now with the President dead Jack Ryan is the new President of the United States . Most Presidents have a Cabinet and Congress and other Senior Officials to help make the transition to power run smoothly . Jack Ryan has to rebuild his government almost from the ground up.Tom Clancy writes large sprawling novels . This one is actually a bit longer than most other Clancy novels coming in at nearly 900 pages . There is a lot of storyline to cover . Clancy likes to have the main plotline with several subplots that eventually tie in to the main story and also augment what is going on . Only one of these subplots felt truly superfluous that being the Mountain Men subplot as it did not actually add anything to the main plotline nor did it even touch the main story . It was set up early as something large and fizzled out near the end as if Clancy forgot that he had that subplot going and then realized that he did n't have anywhere for it to go . Otherwise all the storylines fit into the larger story and with all the detail that Clancy provides the novel does n't feel as weighty as it would appear to be.The detail that Tom Clancy provides gives the novel a sense of realism that perhaps these events are not so implausible as we might have once thought . After September 11 and with threats of bioterrorism this novel has gone from being militarypolitical fiction to a grim vision of what may very well occur in our near future . We see the potential for evil in the world and dishonest men in the United States and abroad . We see the potential for good men and women to step up in government service and to attempt to do the right thing . Clancy shows both sides of the coin and if Jack Ryan is an overly honest and morally upright character.we must remember that he is the hero of the series . He is exactly the kind of man we want this series of books to revolve around.The bottom line for this novel is that it is well written and while it may be long winded at times it was a quick reading novel despite being around 900 pages . The story is compelling and while we know that our hero and our country will come out alright we do n't know what horrific events Clancy will subject Jack Ryan and America to.and that 's why we keep reading . ",4
"I read this book when it came out and it is everything you expect from Clancy a very well thought out story line with lots of details great character development rich in sub plots and story . Ok he is increasingly leaning to the right of Rush Limbaugh but that is kind of the charm . Well now comes the new global reality we have with the 911 attacks and wow this book almost reads as a historical fiction book . Ok it still needs a little bit of faith on the readers part but look at what is in the book a presidential sex scandal A passenger plane used as a weapon biological terrorist attacks and a President with a CIA background ok wrong Bush but close . All Clancy fans have either read this book or will regardless of the reviews here . For those of you that have not read one of his I think given the times we are in this is a great start and will open you up to a catalogue of great fiction by Mr Clancy his nonfiction is even not bad .

"I am an Army veteran and I can tell you Mr. Clancy got it all wrong . I shall now tell you how and why.Mr . Clancy has no first hand knowledge of the military but he has powerful contacts politicians and generals . He makes some calls and gets to look at all the latest gadgetry . Unfortunately the high ranking officers briefing him only show him the best parts . They gloss over the not so good stuff . Clancy apparently falls for it hook line and sinker ! Here are some examples . The laser stuff at the National Training Center doesnt work near as well as Clancy describes . In all of my rotations I never had laser equipment that worked . Also the idea of two training regiments and a national guard brigade making a cohesive fighting division is ludicrous . Finally such a cobbled together unit could never steamroller an IraqiIranian Army ten times its size as Clancy describes.This is probably the end of the road for me . Unless Mr. Clancy gets back the magic he used to have . This will be the last of his books I will read . ",0
"This is truly an epic an account of the struggle between the democracy of the United States and terrorism . After the initial almost complete destruction of our government we are left wondering how we will ever be able to put it back together again . At this point the suspense is unbearable and you must read on you simply must . Of course with the survival of the one person among hundreds of key politicians who is the hero Jack Ryan we know that everything will be allright . But we do n't know how and we 're anxious to find out . On the road to happily ever after we encounter one serious incident after another any one of which could put us down for the count . Clancy weaves these plots with great precision using the strokes of a master painter . Jack Ryan starts out slowly cautiously and seemingly unsure of himself but builds confidence in himself to make the right decisions and begins to issue his EXECUTIVE ORDERS to counterbalance and overcome the potential disasters facing him and us.The subplots are intricately woven and very well connected and in a book this long many times the suspense is unbearable.Of course the good guys win but this does not make the story trite nor is this unusual in any way . It is the classic expression of the triumph of good over evil . And what 's wrong with that ? My two favorite passages are Ryan 's confrontation with the Prime Minister of India a woman when she orders the Indian Navy to interfere with the passage of the US Navy in the Indian Ocean as they are on their way to the Persian Gulf and he Ryan in a telephone conversation with her gets her to back down after her initial coy belligerence and Ryan 's confrontation in the oval office with the one who betrayed him.The story is very long and sometimes tedious because of all the details but overall it is terrific readingone of the best books I 've read in a long time . I always thought Ludlum 's spy thrillers were good but I think Clancy has pushed it up a notch to the next level . ",4
"Clancy 's best work seems to be behind him . This book is nowhere near in the same league as _Red Storm Rising_ or _Clear and Present Danger_ . I stopped reading about halfway through and then skimmed through the rest a couple months later . The plot was decent enough but the excessive technical details and Clancy 's endless preaching of his political views ruin it . This book would have been much better if cut down to just over half its size . Maybe two stars seems unfair but that 's all this book deserves compared to earlier work . Let 's hope that the next book about a SinoRussian conflict will give us back the Clancy of the '80s . ",1
"I 'm new to writing reviews here so I decided to check out some of my favorites to see what other 's had said . I 'm a huge Clancy fan and Executive Orders just happens to be my favorite of his tales . When I read what the other 's said about this book I had to do something.. had to stand up for this great novel ! If you are not a Clancy fan or if you read at a child 's reading level then yes this book is probably too complicated for you.. but if you have half a brain and an active imagination this one if for you . The book is well worth the money as it provides many many hours of entertainment . The book is long so it takes some time to complete but it 's not wasted time . This book is classic Tom Clancy and any person who 's read any of his others will agree.I would not recommend this as a person 's first Clancy read . You should read most if not all of the previous books in order to have a better understanding of the plot and the characters . Executive Orders starts up immediately after the previous book Debt of Honor another Clancy great ! left off . A 747 driven by an angered pilot from Japan has just plowed right into the Capitol in D.C. during a joint session of Congress . This effectively destroys the American government and leaves our hero Jack Ryan as the new President . The first 100 pages are gripping especially now post 911 this book was released over 4 years before that day and will keep you hooked for the rest of the book . The tale highlights what it would take to totally reconstruct a government after a massive terrorist attack and then goes on to show how many people in our country and around the world might seek to benefit from America 's new found vulnerability.This is a great book and should not be tarnished by people with short attention spans . Yes it is long . Yes there is much detail and there 's plenty of subplots . These things are what make Clancy 's tales GREAT ! This is why he 's the number 1 author in our country without these things Clancy would be just another thriller author . Read this book and prepare for much enjoyment ! ! ",4
"I had read all of Tom Clancy 's books up to and including this one . But this one made me realize that now that the Cold War was over so was my fascination with Clancy . This book is part Tom Clancy 's Public Policy Opinions and part virus outbreak with a homegrown terrorist plot that without giving too much away ends up a major disappointment . The virus plot is interesting but the political plot was n't to me . Perhaps this is because I do n't share Clancy 's views and he portrayed them as such basic common sense with the opposing side so hapless in offering a rebuttle that I was a little offended . This also made me reflect on his previous books and realize even more that his characters all seem to be either really really good guys or really really bad guys with horrible character flaws . There 's never any shades of gray to his characters and even the scandal that dogs Ryan is due to him being too noble for his own good . Finally I realized that with Jack Ryan as president his days of dodging torpedos in a submarine were at an end and thus my favorite literary action character was being retired to a desk job . ",1
"Wish I had the option for more than 5 stars . As usual Tom Clancy 's stories open many doors into the 'goings on ' in Washington and other countries around the world . Mr. Clancy will be greatly missed . When a presidential election is forthcoming I reread Clancy 's Jack Ryan 's description of A Presidents Responsibilities . Sadly we are never offered a candidate coming even close to the capabilities of this honorable position . Though his later coauthored books are still pretty good and I do enjoy them that special 'magic ' is n't quite right BUT still they are GREAT reads . ",4

"The best part of this book is probably unintentional on Clancy 's part . Jack Ryan succumbs to the seduction of power and turns into a sleazy politician.Throughout the seven Jack Ryan books Jack has developed into a one dimensional superhero . By this book his character is as thin and flat as a piece of cardboard . Throughout this book he is the perfect honest polictical outsider single handedly cleaning up the American political system . The whole time he insists he does n't want the job . But at the end of the book once Ryan feels the power of kicking the butts of the liberal opposition and of the Iraqis he changes his mind and says he will stay in office . Ryan turns into the lying twofaced politician he said he hated.Besides the ending this is mostly a miserable book . The first 400 pages are boring and repetitive . There some really good parts in the middle where all these intricate subplots get going . But most of these subplots go nowhere or are left dangling . There 's an exciting little war at the end but it not enough to make up for the 1100 other pages that go nowhere.There are some minor problems with most of Clancy 's other books but for the most part they are very good exciting and entertaining . This book is a complete shock . It will be interesting to see if he can recover with the next book in the series which was just released . ",0
"I 've been a long time fan of Tom Clancy although Executive Orders was one of the first Clancy books that I 've read recently . I was disappointed with this book partially due to its overall length . It seemed that the first 500 pages could easily have been dropped . I literally skimmed 100150 pages just to get through it . I did n't feel that I was developing a relationship with any character in the book . Sure President Jack Ryan was the main guy but he was still way too distant to really feel that you cared that much for him . Only in the last 200 pages did the pace and action pickup . Save your time for something else . ",1
"but fractured delivery . I liked reading this book but the audio version was unsatisfactory continually jumping forward and backward in time . Also the quality was disappointing skipping sections of the narrative and increasing the difficulty with following the plot ",1
"Other reviewers have given the plot so I wo n't bother . My only problem with this book is that it really needed some good editing . Clancy spends far too many pages setting up every little detail of each subplot.Overall it is a good story and the last 300 pages or so are really good . I 'm glad I read it but I would have liked it better if this behemouth were maybe 100 pages shorter . ",2
"At the end of Debt of Honor a jet airplane slams into a Joint Session of Congress pretty much wiping out the American government and suddenly putting Jack Ryan into the Presidency . While Clancy 's book was at the top of the Best Seller list someone crashed a small plane into the White House yet I heard nothing on the news about how life was imitating art . Now of course this is headline news and Clancy 's books are suddenly being hailed as dire prophecies that are suddenly coming true . In Executive Action as Islamic leader assassinates the President of Iraq forges Iran and Iraq into the United Islamic Republic attacks the United States with biological weapons and invades Saudi Arabia to grab the oil fields . Suddenly Tom Clancy has become the prophet of the moment as his fiction became fact with the terrorist attacks of September 11th . Of course Clancy has not been alone telling such tales but the focus is certainly on his writings at this pivotal moment in history.A few have suggested that Clancy was actually providing a blueprint for the terrorists and I seem to remember that there had never been a skyjacking until Robert Serling wrote about it in a novel . But writers just look at the world around them and find creative opportunities which is certainly no different from what terrorists do in planning operations . However the reason I feel compelled to reread and review Executive Orders is because I think that there are some important things that Clancy has to say about the moment that goes beyond terrorist attacks . First as Jack Ryan repeatedly points out in the novel the actions of terrorists for are fundamentalist Muslims do not reflect on the vast majority of the followers of Islam around the world . A war on terrorism is not a war on Islam no matter what the terrorists claim and no matter what ignorant and bigoted jerks in this country might want to believe . Second another Jack Ryan mantra that human agents are invaluable in trying to gather intelligence on terrorist organizations . Finding terrorists leaders is going to require human agents on the ground and not spy satellites or unmanned drones . Third secrets are important for the governmentmilitary to respond effectively to terrorist attacks . We have the right to know but the first thing enshrined in the Jefferson 's trilogy is life and not freedom of the press . Besides Congress provides oversight in such matters so the intrusive snooping of the press is unwarranted . A corollary of this as Jack Ryan finds out repeatedly in the novel is that you can not trust the press to do the right thing . This particular point was made more strongly in Debt of Honor where news networks had to be convinced that reporting certain facts the government was trying to keep secret would result in the deaths of American military personnel and that this was a bad thing.Executive Orders is a story well told and what is important about it today is not just what it says about what might happen in the days to come but what it says about us as Americans . Clancy 's books touch on all aspects other the current situation and not just the acts of terrorists . Reading the Jack Ryan novels should do more than engender the fear that there will be a biological attack as in Executive Orders or Rainbow Six or a nuclear device as in The Sum Of All Fears and The Bear and the Dragon . The bottom line here is that when you read any of Tom Clancy 's novels do not throw out his emphasis on what is good with your fascination with what is bad . ",4
"I am a Clancy Fan from the start . have read all of his books have his computer game etc . I got bogged down on page 308 of 875 and never went back . A good editor could have knocked off 200+ pages easily . It did not have the snap of Sum of All Fears or his first two novels . Instead it had way too many subplots a fairly for Clancy boring main plot and too much stuffing in between . If you doubt me read one of his first two novels and then big up this behemoth and see if you can finish it ! If you have not read his nonfiction books on Submarine Marine Armored Cav and the nonfiction account of Desert Storm and you are a military junkie do n't miss them ! The best book of all is The Tom Clancy Companion trust me ",1
"A story that is well written and uses realistic characters . Tom Clancy has done his research and has composed it in a highly digestible and enjoyable format . Great fiction and lots of suspense . One of the better fictional military story writers . Lots of intelligence and military details . Clancy has polished the technothriller genre and taken it to a new higher standard . I 've read all of the Jack Ryanrelated stories Hunt for Red October Cardinal of the Kremlin Rainbow Six Clear and Present Danger Red Storm Rising . They are all great . ",3
"Great . Left me wanting to read next in series immediately . Currently trying to read complete series in order . New Clancy fan . ",4
"Tom Clancy 's Executive Orders is a lengthy entertaining read . The crash of a JAL 747 airliner into the Capitol building unexpectedly pushes former CIA agent Jack Ryan into a challenging job he does n't really wantthe American Presidency . Honorably placing duty and public service ahead of politics Mr. Ryan steers America through a multifaceted crisis defeating terrorism kidnapping and assassination attempts and the malicious planting of a deadly Ebola virus in U.S. cities halting the aggression of a religious leader and his IranIraq army and skillfully managing foreign diplomacy with Japan China India and Russia.Published in 1996 the book 's engrossing plot notably contains certain prescient links to more recent events The fictional crash of the airliner into the Capitol may be viewed as foretelling the September 11 2001 terrorist attack on the Pentagon and World Trade Center . Also the events surrounding the Ayatollah Daryaei with his expansionist United Islamic Republic in the book bear a resemblance to the realworld 2003 war with Iraq and ensuing capture of Saddam Hussein.I find the book 's primary weakness to be its overly predictable plot line Good guy meets bad guy suspense builds and the expected outcome follows i.e . good guy wins . In this case the good guy is not just President Ryan but in a more philosophical sense an idealistic vision of the merits of democracy opportunity and political and religious freedomall with a U.S.centric flair.Being an actionpacked novel of interlocking subplots carefully woven together by the author the book could easily be made into an enthralling Hollywood movie complete with impressive technowar battle scenes showing enemy tanks being blown up and burnt to a crisp . The grand finale would be the CIAassisted pinpoint bombing of the reprehensible enemy leader inside of his residence in Tehran suffering in astonishment through the realtime international broadcast of the final seconds of his own life ! However engaging the thrilling plot and commendable detail of Executive Orders may be my personal preference is for more literary works that probe significantly deeper into human relationships emotions and the psyche .

"Book arrived on time and in good shape . Like the prices of books from this vendor . Will buy more in the future . Thanks ",4
"este libro es excelente para atajar una puerta o para hacer ejercisios junto con otros libros malos para levantamiento de pesas . la trama parece la de una pelicula de esas que se ven para esperar que a uno le de sueno . un presidente que tiene que tomar el mando despues de que el gobernante actual es asesinado con todo y gabinete una trama de unos arabes es aburridisimo y mas porque el autor se lo toma todo tan en serio y termina creyendose su historia . ademas el libro es excesivamente largo no lo termine con cada pagina me iba a burriendo mas y finalmente despues de usarlo como banquito termine regalandoselo a una profesora amiga que es fanatica de tom clancy asi que creo que lo deje en buenas manos.LUIS MENDEZ luismendez @ codetel.net.do ",0
"Executive Orders is the beginning of Tom Clancy 's downward spiral . It is a book that suffers from lack of an editor and clumsily written plotlines that go nowhere . That said the patented Clancy formula is still well executed here plenty of edgeof your seat action a complicated plot and the trademark military detail will keep you reading until the end . This is the last of his books which hardcore Clancy fans will enjoy . Take it from me the rest are almost unreadable . ",3
"Continuing adventures of Jack Ryan a wellbeloved character in a fast paced story surrounded by a cast of familiar friends Adm. Jackson Bart Mancuso etc . Keeps me up too late at night just trying to get to the next chapter . Just started Command Authority and already hooked . These are great reading and if you do n't want a book to end Executive Orders fills the bill as it is over 1300 pages . Recommended for allENJOY ! ",4
"This is my second favorite book . First is Rainbow Six . If you like a great plot read this book . The plot is so deep . The only thing about this book that I did n't like that much is the detail . It was still a GREAT book . I encourage you to read it even though it might take you a while . ",4
"Though I had enjoyed Clancy 's previous technothrillers this one was a major disappointment . By making Ryan president he has painted himself into a corner that only reliance on Ryan 's flimsy alterego John Clark a man who will soon be fighting evildoers from a walker if Clancy acknowledges the passage of time will allow him to escape from . Otherwise how plausible is it for the President of the United States to be personally getting involved with gun battles with terrorists and drug runners ? This may not have weakened the novel itself had it not been for Clancy 's interjection of his simplictic politics into his fictional world . His attempt to define how the world should be run through his characters ' action sapped what remaining enjoyment this novel contained . Traditional Clancy fans would be best served by stoppping at Debt Of Honor to let their imaginations work from there rather than the ideological box Clancy seems bent on constructing . ",0
"Fair a bit of a easy book to read and one knows the plot easily but regret also the ending thereof . The military bit however is as always precise and interesting . ",2
"In EXECUTIVE ORDERS Tom Clancy continues the saga of Jack Ryan in a novel that is so long 1358 pages that its length becomes a subtext . Historically when any novel exceeds 1000 pages the author can use this length either to present a multiple point of view that aids the reader is getting involved a good thing or uses that length to present any and all nuances that can impede reader interest a bad thing . In EXECUTIVE ORDERS Clancy takes a middle course but one that leans overly close to the latter.The plot is surprisingly simple for its length . A kamikaze Japanese pilot crashes his 747 jumbo jet into the nation 's capitol building killing the president all of the Supreme Court and very many senators and other lawmakers . Ryan as the recently selected vicepresident assumes the presidency only to face the immediate problem of reconstructing the foundation of the government of the United States . He soon learns that he has other concernsthe Ebola virus has broken out and may be the start of a coordinated bioweapon attack.I had no problem with this basic plot . It after all resonates quite prophetically in the post 911 world . Nor did I even have much of a problem with the annoying and going nowhere subplot of the Mountain Men a plot which easily got lost somewhere in the first 1000 pages . No my concern was with placing EXECUTIVE ORDERS in the Clancy canon of Ryania . Clancy does tend to write at length so those who have come to this novel after having read a few of his other epics will feel quite at home . But here Clancy has gone overboardeven for him . He uses omniscient narrator to peek into too many minds and not enough into the one mind that countsRyan 's . Clancy comes perilously close to a streamofconsciousness style as each narrator breaks in with his own perspective based mostly on a whim that pops into his brain . What Clancy is best at is the technical mumbojumbo verbal wizardry that deals with guns tanks planes and bombs but even here an excessive amount of that quickly palls . When I began to approach the last one hundred pages or so I got the feeling that Clancy realized that after more than 1000 pages of introductory preclimax writing he was still nowhere close to wrapping things up . Those last one hundred pages seemed fast and forced . Unfortunately that is all too common with the genre but with Clancy you usually do not mind being taken for a ride that seemed more than a tad too long . ",2
"The author crafts a superb tale here of events following the abrupt accession of Jack Ryan to his country 's highest office.The USA is attacked both overtly and covertly and Clancy weaves a gripping story of how an inexperienced President somehow manages with the help of a few good menand women to solve one crisis after another.Despite his republican politics I do find Clancy 's books entertaining and full of detail.He even gives a descriptive account of the inner workings of the secret service and seems to have inside knowledge of the layout of the White House family quarters.Understandable as the man has only slept there several times during the Bush administration . One of Mr Clancys better efforts . ",4
"After finishing the previous book I had to get my hands on this one . Went through it in a day and a half . Loved every minute of this read . ",3
"I am a natural speed reader & just received a Kindle for Christmas . I have been downloading favorites to the Kindle & just spent a few hours rereading Clancy 's Executive Orders . The experience was totally spoiled by the HUNDREDS of typos most typically c for e and vice versa . It really ruined the experience of reading a 2041KB 896 pg book . Did n't anyone ever hear of SPELLCHECK ? The book was FIVE STARS but the printing was awful . ",0
"A very entertaining book . Jack Ryan 's assuming the Presidency and facing the tasks at hand is very well detailed . After averting an attempt by the former VicePresident to cause problems Ryan next has to face an Ebola virus unleashed by the Iranians . The gun battle with the terrorists who attempt to kidnap Ryan 's baby pick this book up to another notch . The discovery of an Iranian mole on the White house Secret Service detail is a unique approach in writing . The ending where the Ayatollah is punished is outstanding . All in all a very good book . ",4
"When I began reading Tom Clancy 's books I was enthralled with the author 's exciting plots my summers were usually devoted to reading and rereading his books as I 'd imagine myself in the thick of the action . Since Clancy wrote 1991 's The Sum Of All Fears his books have become longer duller and less interesting . I found Executive Orders to be his worst work to date . The slow meandering plot is pretty hard to follow not because it 's so complicated . It 's not . The problem is that the plot takes so much time getting going that you lose interest as Clancy positions the pieces onebyone . The actual plot is pretty derivative of all of Clancy 's other books so the ending is n't much of a surprise . The most basic problem with Clancy 's work is in his characters . Clancy obviously envisions Ryan to be a bluecollar everyman just one that slipped into the White House through extraordinary circumstances . Much is made by the author of his hero 's status as an independent . It 's too bad that Ryan comes across consistently as a doctrinaire bythenumbers straight out of the pages of The National Review conservative . Clancy who has always been injecting his rightofcenter politics into his books though more obviously and stridently of late puts his politics out in front here . Executive Orders is more politics than policy . Clancy is on his soapbox and the plot too often gets shuffled to the back for President Ryan to give some loopy tirade about liberal special interests and there are n't conservative ones ? . First clue that nonconservatives wo n't be given equal time the book is dedicated to Ronald Reagan who won the Cold War according to Clancy . Give me a break . Too bad Clancy could n't have made his case without his hero 's preachy speeches . After hearing Ryan 's 1314th speech informing another character he is not a politician ! the reader will want to yell back Then shut up already ! The character of Jack Ryan has always been a difficult one to judge heroic by far in Clancy 's other novels Ryan makes the transition from preachy sanctimonious hero to preachy sanctimonious jerk in this novel . A Tom Clancy novel hits you hard and fast and the action takes your breath away but when the plot slows down and we try to get character moments they sometimes seem painfully forced . Clancy characters are written like postit notes this is the Good Guy who is a conservativesoldierCIA analyst etc . This is the Bad GuyGirl who is a liberalRussian spyterroristfeminist etc . Can you really tell me how much different the characters of Jack Ryan and John Clark are from one another aside from their names and character histories ? Not a whole heck of a lot . I 'm sure Clancy thinks he 's giving America the kind of leader read conservative they want in this book but Ryan comes across as a breezy I'mdoingtherightthing and people will see that conservative whose politics and style bear a striking resemblance to Newt Gingrich . The old GoldwaterforPresident slogan In your heart you know he 's right is a favorite dream of conservatives and Clancy relies on it here . Why does the subplot with the mountain men militia group fizzle out so spectacularly ? Probably because Clancy ca n't bring himself to make people whose political viewpoint he sympathizes with the bad guys . In the end the reader will sigh with relief when he or she finishes this monstrosity . I did . My advice to you do n't even pick this one up . ",0

"Although I 'm a fan of the Jack Ryan series Executive Orders plods along too much . However you need to read this book so you can follow Jack Ryans life . ",2
"Executive Orders is without a doubt one of the best most exciting books I have ever read . Fans of previous Clancy works will love this latest installment which provides action suspense and vivid human drama using the story of a nonpolitician in one of the worlds most political jobs . I bought this book as soon as it came out I had just finished gobbling down Clancy 's other works in less than two months and read it day and night the whole time with my science teacher heckling me to loan it to him . With good detail and good information and direction Clancy 's works have reached their highest point with Executive Orders ",4
"In the typical writing of Tom Clancy this book follows right along with the tense situations and sucsess that Jack Ryan follows in all previous stories . A well crafted scenerio to follow in the many previous novels . Well worth the read . ",3
"Clancy is always good and this book is not much different . However it had too many subplots which detracted from the overall story . It became slightly confusing but I had to push through to get to the main theme so it detracted my enjoyment of the book . Had the style been slightly more focused I would have rated it five stars .

"In a former life I was a public librarian . On the morning of 9ll I was walking back into the library after helping the local Red Cross arrange to ship units of blood to New York . A retired AirForce officer was walking out carrying Tom Clancy 's EXECUTIVE ORDERS . He looked at me and said We told them how to do it.Recently a favorite author tweetered about a study conducted to pin point identifing characteristics of Musiem terrorists . I read the study and gagged . Mr. Clancy did a much more outstanding job in 1996 with EXECUTIVE ORDERS.Read it and match it against today 's newspapers and media reports.Nash Black author of SINS OF THE FATHERS . ",4
"U.S. Congress almost totally wiped out terrorist attempt to abduct member of presidential family biological warfare Ebola Virus against U.S. and an exCIA black ops spook is the new U. S. President . Part way through realized I had already read it but just long enough ago that I had to finish . The character developments are tight but thorough writing is excellent do n't know if Clancy can do bad and suspense abounds . This book does not contain the EXCESSIVE blood gore and guts that some books of the same genre do . This is a definite ++ for me . Naturally there are some shoot outs but not terribly graphic . However I will admit to skimming through descriptions of inhumane treatment of animals.Yes there are a lot of story lines and subplots afoot in this 1272page tome but if you really read it and do n't just flip the pages everything falls into place.You too will probably begin to wonder why the U. S. is run by politicians rather than by people who have the appropriate knowledge and experience to do the job . I thoroughly enjoyed loved this book and it is on my list of what I need to read yet again . ",4
"The Cold war may be over but the combination of people who posses true fear and real hatred along with newer deadlier technologies that create horrifying weapons of mass destruction have made the world a more dangerous planet . In this novel Clancy brings alive two very major challenges to America 's current role in the world.First Clancy outlines a believable coalition of antiAmerican nations united only by a desire to profit from our difficulties . Second he chillingly describes the horrors of a biological epidemic deliberately unleashed by someone who is driven by hatred.It is worth enduring the too long and too frequent Jack Ryan speeches and maudlin introspection to get to the 80 % of the book which outlines a world that could be and dangers that are all too real . This is one of Clancy 's more thought provoking novels . ",3
"CLANCY IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES . DID NOT DISAPPOINT ME . LOTS OF ACTION AND INTRIGUE . COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN ",4
"At what point exactly did Clancy dispense with the editorial process ? This and surrounding novels contain several points where the same phrase is rehashed over and over not to mention the overt political commentary mentioned by so many others here . It 's getting to seem like it 's not worth the effort to wade through his books anymore . ",2
"I 'm not a big Tom Clancy fan especially novels with his name written by other writers . But I had occasion to receive Debt of Honor and do like his writing . So much I am now reading Executive Orders.I only have a couple of observations which have nothing to do with how good or bad the plot and writing are.First it should n't take 1000 pages to tell a story which probably justifies 400 pages at the most . But the writing is good so excessive filler is n't annoying enough to stop following the real plot.My other observation concerns Tom Clancy 's fixation regarding smoking . People smoke in restricted areas which has no effect on the plot . Jack Ryan quit smoking blames his wife and keeps sneaking a smoke in restricted areas . Is this Clancy 's rebellion against government restriction of personal choices ? I agree but my choice is not to be subject to tobacco smoke . These incidents add nothing to the plot but they annoy the hell out of me.Again not enough to stop reading but you 'd think he 'd announce his problem via the media and spare his readers.Aside from that I was pleased to see Mark Greaney writing books with Clancy 's name . Like a breath of fresh air ! Norm ",2
"Monster of a book . Solid where Clancy sticks to what he does best writing about espionage warfare foreign affairs and so forth but weak and tedious when Clancy tries to bring in his politics over a full page devoted to a flat income tax does n't advance the story at all for example . Weaker than his other books the next book Rainbow Six is much better . ",2
"I have read all Tom Clancy 's books with the exception of his ops book . It took me four years to find the energy to finish reading this book that had a rather convoluted plot at the outset . In uncharacteristic style this book seemed to ramble and peter out in spots . The battle rhetoric was over the top and unnecessarily long winded . I only finished it in order to read the newest Jack Ryan epic The Bear and The Dragon because regardless of the rambling I still really like Ryan Clark and Chavez . ",1
"Executive Orders is 1358 pages long . Yes you read that correctly 1358 pages long ! No one has ever praised Tom Clancy for the brevity of his prose but 1358 pages is one audaciously long book . The only thing that could keep reading a novel of this length from being an overwhelmingly tiresome exercise is for it to contain an audaciously good story . Fortunately for Tom Clancy and Jack Ryan fans this book resoundingly succeeds on this count.Now please be forewarned IF YOU HAVE NOT READ DEBT OF HONOR YET THEN GO NO FURTHER WITH THIS REVIEWNow if you have read Debt of Honor you will remember the absolutely shocking way it ended with a rogue Japanese commercial airline pilot crashing his 747 into the Capitol Dome during the President 's speech to a joint session of Congress killing all of Congress the President the Cabinet and the Supreme Court justices among others . This all happened after the sitting Vice President has resigned in disgrace and Jack Ryan was just approved to be the new VP by acclimation vote of Congress before the plane struck.So now Jack is President and he has rebuild a devastated government while facing a political threat from the former VP who thinks he should be president a foreign crisis brought about by Middle East upheavals one of which is proving to be quite prophetic and a domestic crisis brought about by a biological terrorist attack . It 's just another day in the life of Jack Ryan.The real appeal of this book is that every different plot thread is extraordinarily well thought out and set up . In most books this ambitious you will find certain plot lines boring making you anxious to get to more exciting portions of the story . In Executive Orders Clancy never falls into that trap . You can feel each different thread building upon the others instead of running in opposition to them . The payoff is a tremendous climax or rather a series of them which rewards the reader for their efforts throughout this magnum opus.Executive Orders is a crowning achievement in the Jack Ryan Universe . There are so many fabulous books in the Ryan series but this one is its apex . ",4
"Jack Ryan and Tom Clancy may have reached their pinnacle of achievement with this book . However this book is definitely not the place to start the series as a minimum The Hunt for Red October Patriot Games and Debt of Honor should definitely be read before this book.Jack due to the events detailed in Debt of Honor suddenly finds himself President of the U.S. a position which he never aspired to and in which he feels decidedly uncomfortable . But good former Marine that he is he quickly buckles down to the demands of the job a job that rapidly spawns seemingly endless problems and complications . In detailing these Clancy weaves an incredible number of subplots together an assassination of the Iraqi President and the amalgamation of that country with Iran an attempt to kidnap his youngest daughter a biological attack on the U.S. a heat up of the continuing dispute between the two Chinas an attempt by the former Vice President to remove Jack from office and multiple attacks on his integrity by the news media . This is where Clancy shines as each of these subplots is probably strong enough to be a novel in its own right . They all have strong dramatic elements and are not only plausible but frightening in just how close they are to events in the real world that have occurred since this book was written so much so that the notion has been put forth that certain terrorist elements got the ideas for their deeds from this book and Debt of Honor.Jack is well drawn . His reactions to situations and problems make sense for the type of man he is and Clancy does a good job of making the reader empathize with him . Most of the other main characters are shown with enough depth to make them real though it definitely helps if you have read the prior novels in this series as some of the background for these characters was presented earlier and is not rehashed in this book . However most of the characters are not excessively deep and it is very clear who are the ` good guys ' and who are the ` bad ' which perhaps is a good thing in a thriller.The battle scenes are typical Clancy filled with a great number quite accurate technical details perhaps too much so as at times the picture of just what war is really like gets lost in all these details . Also somewhat of a detraction is the fact that the ` good guys ' have too easy a time of it it seems like all their plans are precisely accomplished with few of the screwups and surprises that always happen in real conflicts . Which leads to the other fault with this book it really is too long and a fair amount of it could have been cut without losing the impressive tapestry effect.Some may object to the political viewpoints expressed in this novel as they are decidedly on the right of the spectrum . But Clancy does a good job of detailing why these viewpoints should at least be given some careful thought by all Americans . Here we find good rationales behind limiting the power of the press under certain circumstances the necessity for maintaining both a strong military and a strong intelligence network cases where the power of the President may need to exceed the powers granted by the Constitution when diplomacy is appropriate versus military action and just how much diplomacy is dependent on having the military power to back up stated positions . It is just these viewpoints that elevate this book from a blockbuster adventure novel to one with substance . A quick perusal of any newspaper today will show exactly the points Clancy makes here from the obvious ` slanting ' of the reporting to the need for a military that is second to none.A vivid tale of great breadth exciting and informational well worth the time it takes to read . Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd hyperpat ",4
"This is also one of Tom Clancy 's better books it follows on the heals of Debt of Honor . I think that Debt of Honor and Executive Order should be read back to back . As the ending of Debt of Honor is continued into Executive Order.The plot is a very plausible one since the invasion of Iraq and the execution of Saddam . The fear that Iran could enter into Iraq and unite it with their own country due to the large Shia population within Iraq . Tom Clancy shows once again his foresight into a possible scenario.The other interesting coincidence is the lawsuit against Ryan as President of the United States which to a degree reflected the 2000 election this book was published in 1998 and the execution of Saddam and war in the middle east . In some ways Jack Ryan was a foreshadow of GWB and the events that would surround his presidency . ",4
"Clancy has a talent for spinning tales with mutiple interwoven plots and this book will not disappoint those who have come to enjoy this style.Our hero Jack Ryan now finds himself promoted to the very top position in the United States government the presidency . A job he did n't want circumstances have placed him in the excutive office with a full two thirds of the government apparatis demolished via a terrorist act.To add to his woe middle eastern agents have introduced biological warfare into the country and one of the secret service men guarding him is a sleeper agent waiting for the proper moment to execute him.In true Clancy style all these things develop simultaneously and provide an interesting if rather longish story . I find it particularly interesting to note that much of the action seems to mirror the real world September 11th terrorist acts the book was released a couple of years prior to this event . Could it be that the novel was used as a blueprint by real world terrorists or at least provided them the idea ? It 's an interesting theory . Read the story and make your own determination.Bottom line is this is an important installment in the ongoing adventures of the now legendary Jack Ryan one you will want to read and add to the collection . The tale will keep you up late waiting to see how Jack copes with the developing situations though the outcome is never really in doubt . Recommended ~P~ ",3
"Like reviewers before me on other books I would 've rated this book at less than one star but Amazon does n't allow that sooooo here it is . I was tooling along through this book 's immediate predecessor Debt of Honor and really enjoying the book wondering how it would end . Then in the last 75 pages I saw where Clancy was leading all of us his loyal readers . I groaned to myself and said oh nooooo not thattttt ! And guess what ? He did it . He took Jack Ryan from National Security Advisor to Vice President to President in less than 5 pages . Is n't popular fiction wonderful ? You can put sht between two covers put Tom Clancy 's name on it and the general reading public will think it 's wonderful . Well I 'm here to tell you it was n't and is n't and Tom Clancy should be ashamed off himself for putting such truly bad prose on paper . Debt of Honor ended badly and that 's when I knew Clancy was well past his prime . I should 've guessed that Executive Orders would not be any better.Executive Orders picks up where DoH left off with our stalwart White Knight Jack Ryan taking up residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue . I could n't believe the story line but I plugged along . Ryan started out admirably and in some ways stayed that way in EO but the entire premise of his ascension to power was just so preposterous as to make the novel laughable.For someone who writes detail so well Clancy lost sight of the fact that there would have been so many factors that would have had to fall into place exactly to permit this type of event to take place . A 747 jumbojet into the capital would just not happen especially on the night the President is addressing a joint session of Congress . Air traffic is vectored away from downtown DC to make just such an event implausible.I really had a difficult time swallowing what TC was peddling in this overly long tome . Readers may have noticed that Tom has also developed a devoted following with his nonfiction books such as Marine Submarine Armored Cav Airborne Into the Storm and Every Man a Tiger . He does a great job with those books because he can get into all the technodetail that he puts in his novels and he does n't have to make it all seem believeable . The stuff he writes about in those books is here today and he does n't have to make it plausible . He can write those books like the thoughtful student of the military that he has proven he once was . He should stay with the nonfiction special interest books he does so well.With Debt of Honor Executive Orders and Rainbow Six Tom Clancy has proven to be a caricature of the author he once was . He 's really stinking rich now and apparently given up on giving his readers a good read . Now he just wants to peddle Sht and get paid for it.Tell you what Tom . Why do n't you take your wealth dabble in whatever it is rich folks like you dabble in and forget writing fiction . You had a few good books in you and you wrote them . Now you have nothing left . It 's time for a new hobby . ",0
"I should n't complain I was stupid enough to buy the book . The & gt1400 pages went fast though because I skipped huge sections of text any time he got int one of his diatribes . These are worse than anything Ayn Rand ever wrote and much stupider . And while we 're at it someone should make a top ten list of his worst dialogue . I would but I can not bear to go back through the book . ",0
"I just reread all 1335 pages of this complex multilayered story . Its character portrayals are spot on and the battle sequences are thrilling . If you 've enjoyed any of Clancy 's books you 'll love this one . ",4
"Whatever one might think of Clancy 's writing this book 's political and sociological significance has grown considerably since September 11 and one can not help but wonder if the attacks somehow found inspiration in these pages . A quote from the fictional terrorist Ali Badrayn on page 406 is sadly ironic It 's not difficult gathering information in the modern age . The American media publishes so much and it can all be easily accessed now . Clancy 's book itself could be considered part of that easily accessed media which the fictional Badrayn exploited . Published in 1997 it explores the theme of simultaneous terrorist attacks on the United States not unlike what the country witnessed in 2001 . Although the parallels may not be exact it does not require a great leap of faith to conclude that reallife architects of synchronized terror may have found some inspiration here.A jumbo jet is purposely crashed into the United States Capitol building . Shortly thereafter terrorists release a potent strain of the Ebola virus in several major cities . Having identified the culprits America declares war on the attackers . The United States ' military attention is diverted overseas while additional threats plague the country and its leadership . Other similarities many dealing with the aftermath are more predictable but all too familiar . Foreign dignitaries arrive to express condolences and services are held at the National Cathedral . Banks and financial markets were closed as were schools and many businesses 96 . Many Americans let the new president know he is in their prayers despite the fact that his mandate to rule has been brought into question by a bizarre detour of the electoral process . Echoing George W. Bush after the attacks President Jack Ryan speaks these words to television reporters America is still America 70 and We have buried our dead . We will mourn their losses for a long time to come . But our country lives and the friends we lost on that horrible night would have it no other way Our economy has taken a nasty shock but survived and is still the strongest in the world . This is still America . We are still Americans and our future starts with every new day 255 . On the Muslim question he comments We must understand that religion has nothing at all to do with these inhuman acts Islam is not the enemy of our country or any other I know that Islam like Christianity and Judaism teaches us about a God of love and mercy and justice 1248 . Washington National airport remains closed for an extended period of time . Other flights into DC airports are instructed to avoid a 20mile radius centered on the White House . Flights ignoring these instructions and warnings would be challenged by fighter jets 145 . The fictional ground zero is almost too realistic The real trick was coordinating the actions of the cranes which dipped into the craterthat 's how it lookedlike a quartet of giraffes drinking from the same water hole never quite banging together due to the skill of the operators 78.While I am not normally a Clancy fan this book earns an extra star for its remarkable foresight so much foresight that it raises new questions about responsible freedom of press and speech . To be fair few could have predicted that a book published in 1997 would so closely foreshadow events four years later . As usual the majority of Clancy 's characters are endowed with high levels of testosterone and cowboy mentalities . His effort to include women in responsible roles while admirable is also obvious . One can also reasonably assume that Clancy is occupying the bully pulpit through President Ryan speaking his own political views with commonman grit and gumption 994 . Nonetheless the book remains a worthwhile read . It is engrossing thoughtfully constructed and eyeopening . Clancy continues to entertain while educating the public on issues of national security which may otherwise go unnoticed . Good on him . ",3
"Many reviewers have commented on the fact that Clancy is using Jack Ryan as his voice to put forth his own view of America . The evil press the ugly politions trying to do good only gets you screwed You get the picture . What I 'm suprised at is that his misogynic tendencies do n't get more press.In this book the Indian Prime Minister is a manipulative schemer . The women secret service agents guarding the president 's children turn out to be little more than clay pigeons and even the woman head of the president 's protection detail does little more than marry one of the male heros of this book . This carries on a trend he established in his earlier books was it in Sum of All Fears that Ryan 's female White House antagonist totally crumbled under pressure ? and does little to flatter Mr. Clancy.Recently we 've been seeing too much Clancy and not enough entertaining fiction in his books . Perhaps he 's got writer 's block or maybe it 's just that he 's on autopilot but his last 3 or 4 novels have been major disappointments . If you 've never read Clancy read Hunt for Red October and see what he 's really capable of . If you read this clunker you may never be persuaded to read his good books . ",1
"I do Like Tom Clancy but I felt that this book was very long winded . I hope that the ideas that Clancy expresses in this book remain mostly fiction . The story is frightening . ",3
"Okay first of all I want to mention that I have nothing against Tom Clancy . He is a great author and write 's amazing books.but this book was a little different . It starts off great ! The capitol building is demolished by a plane crash and the president dies and tons more . But then the technical part of Tom Clancy emerged . For nearly 1000 pages I was bored to death and often fell asleep with this book in my lap . When I woke up I was on page 1190 and another boring part of the book emergedTom Clancy 's descriptive and technical war descriptions . So I fell back to sleep and woke up during the final good partthe bombing of the UIR president . All in all if you can read 1000 pages an hour this book wo n't seem so bad but otherwisemake sure you bring some caffeine pills and drink some coffee cause this one can put you to sleep but it can also improve your physical look seeing how it weighs about 1015 pounds . Thanks anyways Tom ",3
"Poor Jack Ryan . He 's a reluctant President trying to do the most complex job in the civilized world with sincerity and integrity and Tom Clancy assaults him from every direction ! President Ryan faces a barbaric and devious attack by a ruthless foreign power internal terrorist threats emanating from both inside and outside the United States a sleazy political conspiracy and an assassination plot . And all he has to do while he 's dealing with all this adversity is reconstruct a destroyed Congress and Supreme Court ! This is Tom Clancy at his best pages fly by as all these plot points play out . Clancy does indulge in some political fantasies like using humilation on drug offenders sorry Tom I 'm not with you on this one but you do not have to agree with the minimal political musings to love the book . Like most of his work this is a plotdriven fastpaced story where the bad guys are capable of dabbling in stateoftheart technology but the good guys are always just enough ahead to emerge victorious in a rousing emotionally satisfying conclusion . ",4
"Having read all the Jack Ryan books over the years this is a jewel in the crown . A Must Read ! ",4
"You will perhaps never find a more brilliantly executed politicalmilitaryinternational relations thriller that matches the power drama and vision as Executive Orders . This book is an unparalled feat of emotional psychological and moral exposition . This amazing novel should be required reading in all our army airforce and naval colleges . Any student of international relations could not help but be rewarded by reading this outstanding piece of literature . In a world where fiction becomes reality where the tail wags the dog and instant media dictates the thin line between what is real and unreal one has only to read this book to gain a more inclusive picture of what are the true issues facing our world today . ",4
"The scope of this book amazed me . Clancy writes about the beginning of a new nation a rebirth of an old one the successful use of weapons of mass destruction tensions between 'the two Chinas ' I loved that one and ethics within the mediaand he did it all in less than 1500 pages . Kudos Tom Clancy.My one complaint is the 'John Wayne ' style of characters . The good guys should all be wearing white hats while the evil villians need to be dressed in black . And just once I wish a Clancy female character would be a liitle over weight and not quite brilliant . A little humanity would n't be too bad.It 's a good book . It 's not too heavy and very entertaining . It was perfect for the long commutes I 've been enduring lately . I find it kind of unsettling that he published it in 1996 . Coincidence I guess just like the conclusion to his last 'Ryan ' novel where a suicide airliner changed our world . But heyat least a superbowl has n't been nukedyet . ",3
"i do n't know why this section is needed i think that just hitting the stars would be good enough for a review who has time to write all this ",0
"Good book as all Tom Clancy 's books are . But it dragged a bit in spots and sometimes hard to tell who the characters are . But always worth a read . ",3
"But the end is totally immature writing . It 's like me making sense of battlefield news . Not Clancy 's best . Just meh . ",2
"Held my interest from the very beginning . Could n't put the book down . I have read most of Clancys books and find them very intense ",4
"This is probably the best Jack Ryan book . Ever . I have read and reread this story at least five times . Each pass finds something new to focus on . Clancy 's knowledge of the Intelligence community coupled with his insights of our military make this novel come to life . If you enjoy the whatifs of the political world you will love the concept of building our government from nothing.This story can be enjoyed by Jack Ryan fans or by anyone who loves a good thriller.Buy it for your Kindle and save your wrist from carpal tunnel . I own the paperback as well and needed a splint after holding it for hours ! ",4
"The book had some exciting parts but it was way too long and had too many boring political ramblings . Clancy could have easily trimmed onethird of its length . He could have left out the Mountain Men entirely.Clancy does much better writing about the military than he does about politics . The whole thing with Kealty did not make sense . And I sure got tired of Ryan'sClancy 's conservative agenda.As always when the battles start Clancy 's superb storytelling finally comes through . ",2
"Before Sept. 11th the events in Executive Orders and its prequel Debt of Honor seemed extremely implausible . In Debt of Honor a plane used as a missile to destroy the Capitol just as the terrorists did to the World Trade Center and Pentagon . Later in Executive Orders the United States was attacked by a biological weapon reminiscent of the anthrax scares the country suffered through the Fall of 2001 . One has to wonder is Tom Clancy clairvoyant.Throughout the novel Clancy 's hero Jack Ryan meets the challenges of putting the government back together and defending America against both domestic and international enemies . Admittedly Ryan makes political mistakes relying on other technocrats and bureaucrats he has worked with through all of the novels in which he has appeared . Clancy uses Ryan to express his own conservative political ideology which I personally do not totally agree with.Despite my aversion to Clancy 's politics the book is well plotted though overlong . Two novels could been gotten from this plot . It will be interesting to see how the nonpolitician President Jack Ryan copes in the next book when its time to work a reconstituted Congress pick a Vice President and name nine judges to the Supreme Court .
